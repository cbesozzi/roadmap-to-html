        <h3><a id="_Toc448153042"></a>Can I appeal the court’s revocation decision/action? What court has jurisdiction?</h3>
        <p>It depends. The appellate court (which is the court above the district court) that made the decision will have the authority to hear the case, unless you have already completed your time on supervision. In that case, appellate courts have held that they don’t have authority to hear the case, because your have already completed your sentence, and have no “injury” that the court can fix.<sup><a href="#footnote-910" id="footnote-ref-910">[884]</a></sup></p>
