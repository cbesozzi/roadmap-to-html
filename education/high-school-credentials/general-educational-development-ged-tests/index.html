          <p class="sidebox">The California High School Proficiency Examination is another high school proficiency test that is similar to the GED because it allows people to earn a high school proficiency certificate. However, the CHSPE is intended for minors (people under 18 years old) who are<em> still in high school</em> but wish to finish early in order to go to college or enter the workforce.</p>

            <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/education/high-school-credentials/general-educational-development-ged-tests/how-do-i-prepare-for-the-ged-test/">How do I prepare for the GED test?</a></h2>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448153779"></a>How do I prepare for the GED test?</h3>
              <p class="text"><strong>FIRST:</strong> Learn as much as you can about the GED test. You should know: What subjects and skills does the test cover? How long does the test take? What do the questions look like? You can get information by contacting the GED Testing Service (see PG. 1058 for contact information), by asking teachers or tutors in a GED program, and by looking at GED practice tests and study materials (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials). Here is some general information to start with:</p>
              <ol class="text">The GED test has 4 modules (subject-matter tests): language arts, math, social studies, and science. You can take all 4 modules on the same day, which takes 7+ hours; or you can schedule them for separate dates.<sup><a href="#footnote-2724" id="footnote-ref-2724">[2691]</a></sup> </ol>
              <ol class="text">As of January 1, 2014, the GED test is computer-based; but if you’re in a prison or jail that doesn’t have computers set up, you might be taking the test with a pencil and paper.<sup><a href="#footnote-2725" id="footnote-ref-2725">[2692]</a></sup> To find out which version of the test you’ll take, ask your facility’s education department staff. </ol>
              <p class="text"><strong>SECOND:</strong> Learn as much as possible about your readiness for the test. You should know:</p>
              <ol class="text">Which subjects or skills do you feel confident about, and which ones should you focus on improving? </ol>
              <ol class="text">How comfortable do you feel with the test format? </ol>
              <ol class="text">Do you need to practice answering test questions more quickly? </ol>
              <ol class="text">What study methods are best for your current skills and learning style? </ol>
              <ol class="text">You can get a sense of how ready you are by taking practice GED tests on your own, and/or by working with teachers or tutors in a GED program who can give you feedback about your skills (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials, including practice tests). </ol>
              <p class="text"><strong>THIRD:</strong> Make use of teaching, tutoring, and study materials that are available to you. Below is general information about potential resources that you may be able to use:</p>
              <div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re currently incarcerated:</div>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a federal prison</span>: When you get to your federal facility, staff will review your county jail assessment information. If you don’t have a high school degree, you will be enrolled in classes designed to lead up to a GED or a high school diploma (unless they decide that you must take Adult Basic Education classes first).<sup><a href="#footnote-2726" id="footnote-ref-2726">[2693]</a></sup> Ask your education advisor if you have questions about enrollment. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a California state prison</span>: If you don’t have a high school credential, you can enroll in GED classes if your TABE scores qualify you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2727" id="footnote-ref-2727">[2694]</a></sup> You may also be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP).<sup><a href="#footnote-2728" id="footnote-ref-2728">[2695]</a></sup> Ask your correctional counselor or education department staff about enrolling in GED classes or VEP. (Remember, before you enroll in GED or VEP, you must have a TABE score on file.<sup><a href="#footnote-2729" id="footnote-ref-2729">[2696]</a></sup> See PG. 1048 for information about the TABE and getting an educational assessment). </ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a California county jail</span>: If your educational assessment scores qualify you for GED courses, your facility should enroll you if they offer these courses.<sup><a href="#footnote-2730" id="footnote-ref-2730">[2697]</a></sup> If not, you can contact community service organizations to request materials. See Appendix B, PG. 1095 for a list or organizations that provide GED materials. </ol>
              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you are in county jail awaiting transfer to a federal or state facility, you will NOT be allowed to take anything with you, including any books or other materials related to your educational programming, when you are transferred. You will need to gather all of your materials ahead of time and mail them to someone on the outside before you are transferred. That person can then mail your materials back to you at your new facility.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2731" id="footnote-ref-2731">[2698]</a></sup></strong></p>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even though most facilities in California at the federal, state, and county level offer GED classes, often there are long waiting lists to get in, or they are offered in “cycles” (which means that if you miss the beginning of the cycle, you cannot enroll until the next one). If you cannot enroll in a GED class for any reason, you should try to begin studying on your own. Check your facility’s library for GED “prep” books and materials. These resources will walk you through lesson plans, and usually contain sample questions and practice tests.<sup><a href="#footnote-2732" id="footnote-ref-2732">[2699]</a></sup> They can also be ordered through most book distributors. Check with your facility for a list of book distributors that are approved to send materials to inmates. There are also a number of community adult literacy programs and other service organizations that will send books and materials to incarcerated people for free. You can contact these organizations to request the study materials you need. For a list of organizations that provide books and materials to incarcerated people, visit Urbana Campaign to Prisoners at <a href="http://www.books2prisoners.org/partnerships.php">http://www.books2prisoners.org/partnerships.php</a> or see Appendix B, PG. 1095. </p>
              <h4 class="textbox">WHEN PREPARING FOR BOTH THE GED EXAM AND RELEASE:</h4>
              <p class="textbox">If you are preparing for a GED test while incarcerated and find out that you will be released before you finish your class or program, ask your GED teacher for a “progress report.” This report will show exactly where you are in the process, so that you can pick up your studies in the same place after your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2733" id="footnote-ref-2733">[2700]</a></sup> </p>

              <p class="text">In most adult high school diploma programs, you can choose to enroll in traditional classes, or to complete courses at your own pace through individual study and regular check-ins with teachers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2749" id="footnote-ref-2749">[2716]</a></sup> In addition, some programs also allow you to complete correspondence courses through mail or email with teachers (for details on distance learning, see PG. 1076; for correspondence programs, see PG. 1079). After completing all of the required courses, you will have to pass an “exit” exam, called the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) to receive your high school diploma.<sup><a href="#footnote-2750" id="footnote-ref-2750">[2717]</a></sup> All students in California public schools must pass the CAHSEE before they are awarded a high school diploma. This includes people who earn their diploma while incarcerated. </p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153783"></a>How much time will it take to earn my high school diploma?</h3>
              <p class="text">It depends. Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, life circumstances, and learning preferences. Depending on the program you enroll in, you might work toward your diploma individually, at your own pace; or you might work with a teacher who creates assignment deadlines and a long-term schedule for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2751" id="footnote-ref-2751">[2718]</a></sup> </p>
              <h4 class="textbox">GENERAL TIPS</h4>
              <p class="textbox">If you’ve already completed many of the courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, an adult high school diploma program is likely a faster route for you than the GED.If you haven’t completed many high school courses, the GED will probably be a faster path to your high school equivalency certificate.<span class="emphasisitalic">But consider</span>, if you have not taken many high school courses yet, and you have some time to spend on your high school education, you might prefer a diploma program because it can be an opportunity to explore new subjects and skills that you won’t learn in a GED program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2752" id="footnote-ref-2752">[2719]</a></sup> <strong>Warning: watch out for scam programs, which will try to charge you money for a fake diploma. See PG. [] for details.</strong></p>

              <p class="text">Adult high school diploma programs may be available in adult schools or community colleges near you for free or at low cost. Many schools provide adult high school classes for free, and provide books and materials for free as well. Others may charge registration and tuition fees. (However, schools that charge fees may also offer financial aid to low-income students. Check with each school about fees and financial aid.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2757" id="footnote-ref-2757">[2724]</a></sup> Also, community adult literacy programs may offer high school diploma courses and tutoring for free.

              <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Be careful when choosing a high school diploma program. In recent years, the federal government has shut down several degree programs that were charging money for fake diplomas.<sup><a href="#footnote-2758" id="footnote-ref-2758">[2725]</a></sup> These programs are scams. To avoid being scammed by a fake diploma program, watch out for the following clues<sup><a href="#footnote-2759" id="footnote-ref-2759">[2726]</a></sup>:The program seems too good to be true. <strong>Getting a high school diploma requires time and effort. If a program lets you get a diploma without taking classes or tests, it is probably fake. </strong>The program offers free tests or classes, but charges for the diploma itself. <strong>This is a dead giveaway that the program is illegitimate. </strong>The program claims to be affilitated with the federal government.<strong> The federal government does not offer high school diploma progams. Only the states approve such programs.</strong></p>

              <ul class="textbox"><strong>TIP 1</strong>: Many community colleges offer dual enrollment programs or continuing education programs, which allow you to earn an adult high school diploma or equivalency certificate AND get started on earning college credits at the same time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2764" id="footnote-ref-2764">[2731]</a></sup> <strong>TIP 2</strong>: If you have meaningful school, work, or life experience, find out if you can make it count toward your diploma. Some adult schools or programs might give you credit for past high school work, job training, work experience, community service, military service, or self-study. Ask the individual school or program if it will do this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2765" id="footnote-ref-2765">[2732]</a></sup></ul>
