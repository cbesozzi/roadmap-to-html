  <p>
    Which employers can see my RAP sheet?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under California law, only certain people are allowed to see your RAP sheet for employment purposes:[1818]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Most public employers can see your RAP sheet. These include all federal, state and local government agencies—including police and fire departments, the California Department of Corrections (CDCR), local Boards of Education, and the U.S. Postal Service.[1819]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Certain private employers can see your RAP sheet if you are applying for a job that involves access to sensitive information (e.g., nuclear power plants, public utilities, private security companies, and financial institutions like banks) OR you will be working with children, elderly, disabled, or other vulnerable people.[1820]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    State occupational licensing agencies[1821] can see your RAP sheet if you apply for a professional license. For more information on licensing restrictions based on a criminal record, see PG. 746.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Law enforcement & criminal justice agencies[1822] have full access to your RAP sheet, including juvenile cases, expunged/dismissed cases, and sometimes even sealed records! 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to get a copy of your RAP sheet, these employers are allowed to ask for your fingerprints, including making you do Live Scan (electronic) fingerprinting.[1823]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is illegal for a regular employer (i.e., NOT an employer listed above) to do any of the following:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ask you for a copy of your RAP sheet;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Get a copy of your RAP sheet through any other means; or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Make you prove that you do NOT have a record—for example, by requiring you to get fingerprinted, or asking you for a “notice of no record”.[1824]
