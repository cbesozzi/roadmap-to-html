<div class="chaptertitlesubheading">Reunification &amp; Other Family-Related Issues</div>

<p> <strong><img src="182.png"/></strong></p>

<p class="description">The FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN CHAPTER will give you an overview of the issues that parents and caregivers experience when trying to reconnect with and care for their children, as well as legal issues that arise during incarceration related to children, spouses/partners, and other family-related issues. This Chapter will teach you how to establish or re-establish your rights, responsibilities, and relationship with your child(ren), and how to navigate the family court systems so that you can best handle any issues related to custody, guardianship, juvenile dependency/CPS cases, visitation, child support, spousal support, paternity, and ending marriages or domestic partnerships.</p>

<p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation. </p>

<p class="text">Family support is the biggest predictor of success in reentry.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2256" id="footnote-ref-2256">[2224]</a></sup></sup> Yet family law can be confusing and few family law attorneys represent people in reentry for free. This Chapter aims to provide you with information and resources on how to navigate legal issues related to your family and children, so you will be better equipped upon release.</p>

<p class="text">This Chapter will explain basic family law issues you may face during your reentry. These issues are: </p>

<ol class="text">Reunification with children.</ol>

<ol class="text">Stay-away orders from family members, children and loved ones.</ol>

<ol class="text">Creating and ending partnerships and marriages.</ol>

<ol class="text">Court-ordered debts related to a family law case (including “child support” and “spousal support”).</ol>

<p class="text">This Chapter will guide you through different legal questions that come up and different options you have as a parent, grandparent, spouse, or partner. It will also explain what your rights are as a parent or grandparent with a criminal record trying to reunify with your child or grandchild and/or gain greater legal rights.</p>

<p class="text">We hope to provide you with the information you need to establish a positive relationship with your family and your community. </p>
