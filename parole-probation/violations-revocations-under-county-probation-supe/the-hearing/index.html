  <p>
    What court will hear my case?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The court in the county in which you are supervised has “jurisdiction” (the legal authority) to hear the motion or petition to modify, revoke, or terminate you probation.[708] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For those on probation, it will be either the court in the county in which you are supervised or the court in the county in which the alleged violation of supervision occurred.[709]

  <p>
    Who hears the cases?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Judges, magistrates, or court-appointed hearing officers hear probation revocation cases.[710]

  <p>
    Who represents the interest of probation in the hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What does “preponderance OF THE EVIDENCE” mean?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Requires the court to find that more than half of the evidence at least 51% of it supports the charges or alleged probation violation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The District Attorney (DA), on behalf of the state of California.[711]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What does the prosecutor (D.A.) need to prove? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The prosecutor, also known as the District Attorney (DA), must prove that is more likely than not that you violated probation.[712] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unlike a criminal trial where the DA must prove the case “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the DA in a probation revocation hearing only needs to prove by a “preponderance of the evidence” that you violated probation.[713]

  <p>
    Do I have a right to notice of the probation revocation hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes, unless you waive the notice requirement in writing.[714]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must be given notice before your first court appearance in the probation revocation proceedings, unless you agreed in writing to a modification (a change) or termination (an end) of a specific term of your supervision.[715] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you agreed in writing to a modification or termination of a specific term of your supervision, you also do not have to make an in-person appearance in court for the hearing.[716] We suggest that you speak with an attorney or public defender prior to waiving your right to a revocation hearing.

  <h2><a href="/parole-probation/violations-revocations-under-county-probation-supe/the-hearing/do-i-have-the-right-to-an-attorney-at-the-hearing/">Do I have the right to an attorney at the hearing?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Do I have the right to an attorney at the hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes.[717] Before you waive the requirement to personally appear at the hearing or before you accept an offer of modification of your probation conditions, you should be informed that you have the right to an attorney, and if you cannot afford one, you have the right to a free attorney provided by the court.[718] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you waive the right to an attorney, this waiver must be in writing.[719] Again, we suggest that you speak with an attorney or public defender prior to waiving your right to a revocation hearing.

  <h2><a href="/parole-probation/violations-revocations-under-county-probation-supe/the-hearing/what-rights-do-i-have-during-a-probation-revocatio/">What rights do I have during a probation revocation hearing?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What rights do I have during a probation revocation hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are minimal due process requirements for probation revocation proceedings.[720] This means that you don’t have all of the same rights that you have at trial.[721] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have the following rights:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Written notice of the alleged violations and the possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain mitigating evidence (meaning evidence that would lessen the perceived severity of the violation or help justify it);[722]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Disclosure of the evidence against you;[723]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Timely hearing of the charges at a probable cause hearing and a formal revocation hearing;[724]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The right to present witnesses and evidence.[725] You can subpoena and present witnesses and evidence.[726] A person served with a subpoena for a parole revocation hearing is required to appear at the hearing unless the hearing is held at a place outside the county of his or her residence and more than 75 miles from his or her residence;[727]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.[728] You have a conditional right under the U.S. and California constitutions to confront witnesses whose statements are used against you in a probation violation hearing.[729] This means that you or your attorney may cross-examine any people who gave information or testified that you violated your probation.[730] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A fair and unbiased hearing body;[731] and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A written statement of the decision, the evidence relied on, and the reasons for revoking parole.[732]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: You may waive (give up) your rights, either expressly—by saying you give up the right, or by implication—by failing to assert the right.[733] Therefore, it is important that you take advantage of your rights and complain if a right is violated.

  <p>
    Can the prosecutor (d.a.) introduce evidence that was obtained in violation of my fourth amendment right against unlawful search & seizure at my probation revocation proceeding?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes.[734] You should note that the “exclusionary rule” that usually applies in a criminal court trial—a rule that bars evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—does NOT apply in probation revocation hearings. This means that even if evidence was suppressed in an earlier criminal trial, it can still most likely be brought in to a later parole revocation hearing.[735]

  <h2><a href="/parole-probation/violations-revocations-under-county-probation-supe/the-hearing/can-a-witness-be-excused-from-testifying-in-front-/">Can a witness be excused from testifying in front of me at a probation revocation hearing?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Can a witness be excused from testifying in front of me at a probation revocation hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you if they are deemed fearful or confidential.[736] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Fearful witnesses” are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee’s presence, but the parolee’s attorney must be present.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Confidential witnesses” are witnesses whose identity you are unaware of and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.[737] However, if confidential information is used as part of the reason you’re charged with violating probation, you can request that the prosecutor disclose (reveal) this information or prove that revealing this information would create a risk of harm to the confidential witness.[738]

  <p>
    What happens if a very important witness doesn’t show up to the probation revocation hearing, even though he/she was required to attend?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If a very important (called “material”) state witness fails to attend a parole revocation hearing, and the hearing cannot fairly proceed without the witness, the court can postpone the hearing or dismiss the case.[739]
