<h1>General Educational Development (GED) Tests</h1>

<h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153774"></a>General Educational Development (GED) Tests</h3>

<h4 class="sidebox">GED vs. CHSPE</h4>

<p class="sidebox">The California High School Proficiency Examination is another high school proficiency test that is similar to the GED because it allows people to earn a high school proficiency certificate. However, the CHSPE is intended for minors (people under 18 years old) who are<em> still in high school</em> but wish to finish early in order to go to college or enter the workforce.</p>

  <p>
    What are GED tests? How can they help me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A General Educational Development (GED) test is a high school proficiency test for adults who never completed high school and want to earn a high school equivalency (GED) certificate.[2678] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These tests are administered nationally, but three have been specifically approved by the California Department of Education: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GED® (GED Testing Service); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    HiSET® (ETS); AND 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TASC™ (CTB-McGraw-Hill).[2679] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you pass a GED test in California, you’ll receive a California High School Equivalency Certificate (CAHSEC) (this is the official name for a GED in California).[2680] This certificate is your official proof that you have high school level academic skills. Once you have this certificate, you can apply to colleges and jobs that require a high school credential.[2681] You will need to take and pass the test for several different subject matters (sometimes called “modules”) in order to get your CAHSEC. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Am I eligible to take a GED test to earn my California High School Equivalency Certificate (CAHSEC)?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to take a GED test to get your California High School Equivalency Certificate, you must:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Not have completed high school;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be a resident of California; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be 18 years or older (or 17 in very special circumstances).[2682]

  <h2><a href="/education/high-school-credentials/general-educational-development-ged-tests/how-long-will-it-take-to-earn-my-cahsec/">How long will it take to earn my CAHSEC?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How long will it take to earn my CAHSEC?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, and individual circumstances. You may choose to study on your own, at your own pace; or you may take one or more GED test preparation classes, which may be designed to get you ready by a specific date. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Compared to a high school diploma program, which may require a longer list of classes, the GED can be a “fast track” to a high school credential (for more information on high school diploma programs, see PG. 1059). However, this may or may not be the best fit for you, depending on your needs and learning preferences.[2683]

  <p>
    How much will it cost to earn my CAHSEC?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    in a federal prison,[2684] a California state prison,[2685] or a California county jail,[2686] you should be able to register for a GED test, take GED preparation classes, and get your CAHSEC at no cost to you. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: While GED programs and testing are generally offered at no cost, if you have a high balance in your trust account, your facility may decide to deduct some or all of the costs for certain programs or testing from your account.[2687] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you sign up for a GED test, you must pay a $35 fee for each module (subject-matter tests) you’re scheduling. That adds up to a $140 fee if you register for all 4 modules at once.[2688] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you pass the test (all 4 modules), you’ll get your certificate and official test results by mail at no cost.[2689] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Studying for the GED might require paying for classes and books, but this could cost little or nothing. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Many adult schools and community colleges provide GED classes for free, and provide study materials for free as well. Others may charge registration and tuition fees (up to $25-50 per semester or class). Some schools that charge fees offer financial aid to low-income students. Check with each school about fees and financial aid.[2690]

  <h2><a href="/education/high-school-credentials/general-educational-development-ged-tests/how-do-i-prepare-for-the-ged-test/">How do I prepare for the GED test?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How do I prepare for the GED test?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    FIRST: Learn as much as you can about the GED test. You should know: What subjects and skills does the test cover? How long does the test take? What do the questions look like? You can get information by contacting the GED Testing Service (see PG. 1058 for contact information), by asking teachers or tutors in a GED program, and by looking at GED practice tests and study materials (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials). Here is some general information to start with:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The GED test has 4 modules (subject-matter tests): language arts, math, social studies, and science. You can take all 4 modules on the same day, which takes 7+ hours; or you can schedule them for separate dates.[2691] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As of January 1, 2014, the GED test is computer-based; but if you’re in a prison or jail that doesn’t have computers set up, you might be taking the test with a pencil and paper.[2692] To find out which version of the test you’ll take, ask your facility’s education department staff. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SECOND: Learn as much as possible about your readiness for the test. You should know:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Which subjects or skills do you feel confident about, and which ones should you focus on improving? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How comfortable do you feel with the test format? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do you need to practice answering test questions more quickly? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What study methods are best for your current skills and learning style? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can get a sense of how ready you are by taking practice GED tests on your own, and/or by working with teachers or tutors in a GED program who can give you feedback about your skills (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials, including practice tests). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    THIRD: Make use of teaching, tutoring, and study materials that are available to you. Below is general information about potential resources that you may be able to use:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: When you get to your federal facility, staff will review your county jail assessment information. If you don’t have a high school degree, you will be enrolled in classes designed to lead up to a GED or a high school diploma (unless they decide that you must take Adult Basic Education classes first).[2693] Ask your education advisor if you have questions about enrollment. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: If you don’t have a high school credential, you can enroll in GED classes if your TABE scores qualify you.[2694] You may also be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP).[2695] Ask your correctional counselor or education department staff about enrolling in GED classes or VEP. (Remember, before you enroll in GED or VEP, you must have a TABE score on file.[2696] See PG. 1048 for information about the TABE and getting an educational assessment). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: If your educational assessment scores qualify you for GED courses, your facility should enroll you if they offer these courses.[2697] If not, you can contact community service organizations to request materials. See Appendix B, PG. 1095 for a list or organizations that provide GED materials. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: If you are in county jail awaiting transfer to a federal or state facility, you will NOT be allowed to take anything with you, including any books or other materials related to your educational programming, when you are transferred. You will need to gather all of your materials ahead of time and mail them to someone on the outside before you are transferred. That person can then mail your materials back to you at your new facility.[2698]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Even though most facilities in California at the federal, state, and county level offer GED classes, often there are long waiting lists to get in, or they are offered in “cycles” (which means that if you miss the beginning of the cycle, you cannot enroll until the next one). If you cannot enroll in a GED class for any reason, you should try to begin studying on your own. Check your facility’s library for GED “prep” books and materials. These resources will walk you through lesson plans, and usually contain sample questions and practice tests.[2699] They can also be ordered through most book distributors. Check with your facility for a list of book distributors that are approved to send materials to inmates. There are also a number of community adult literacy programs and other service organizations that will send books and materials to incarcerated people for free. You can contact these organizations to request the study materials you need. For a list of organizations that provide books and materials to incarcerated people, visit Urbana Campaign to Prisoners at http://www.books2prisoners.org/partnerships.php or see Appendix B, PG. 1095. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WHEN PREPARING FOR BOTH THE GED EXAM AND RELEASE:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are preparing for a GED test while incarcerated and find out that you will be released before you finish your class or program, ask your GED teacher for a “progress report.” This report will show exactly where you are in the process, so that you can pick up your studies in the same place after your release.[2700] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit your local America’s Job Center of California (formerly Career One-Stop Centers) for information on GED programs in your area (see PG. 1030 for information on finding your local America’s Job Center of California).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Contact your local public library, adult school, or community college to ask about free or low-cost GED classes near you.[2701] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have Internet access, search online for GED programs near you. Try these resources to start:

  <p>
    I’m ready to take a GED test, how do I sign up?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: Ask your education advisor to sign you up. You should be able to take the test if the education staff thinks you’re ready based on your most recent assessment and/or your current work in class.[2703] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: First, sign up with your facility’s testing coordinator to take a GED predictor test. Depending on your score, you may be scheduled for the next available GED test date at your facility, or you may be enrolled in a GED preparation program for further study.[2704] Ask your correctional counselor or education department staff if you have questions about GED classes, VEP, or the GED predictor test.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: Ask the education staff at your facility to sign you up to take the test the next time it is offered (if it is offered at your facility). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Create an online account at www.ged.com, and then sign up for a specific test date at a specific GED test center. To complete your registration, you must pay the fee ($35 per test module) using a credit card. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To find out what GED test centers are near you, call the GED Testing Service at 1-800-626-9433.[2705] If you have Internet access, you can also use the search tool on the GED Testing Service website,[2706] or visit the GED test center directory on the California Department of Education website at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/gd/gedtestcntrs.asp.[2707] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    General Tips
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may want to register for just 1 or 2 test modules at a time if you can’t afford the full fee or if you want to give yourself time off between studying for the different subjects.[2708] To take the test in California, you must provide state-issued ID[2709] and proof of California residency.[2710] Before registering, ensure that you will have these documents on your test date. (You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or have a SSN to take the GED.[2711]) If you have more questions, contact the GED office at (916) 445-9438 or gedoffic@cde.ca.gov. If you have Internet access, you can also find information posted online by the California Department of Education[2712] and the GED Testing Service.[2713]

    Adult High School Diploma Programs 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GED vs. High school diploma
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Compared to a GED program, which may focus on preparing you to answer test questions quickly, a high school diploma program requires you to complete many classes that are part of a high school education. Required course subjects include: English (reading, writing, literature); math (algebra, geometry); natural science (biology, ecology, physics); social science (history, civics, economics); humanities (art, religion); and electives (health, media literacy).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This section will help you decide whether an adult high school diploma program is a good option for you. You’ll also learn how to locate and sign up for an adult high school diploma program that meets your needs.

  <p>
    What is an adult high school diploma program? How can it help me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These diploma programs are for adults who didn’t finish high school, and who want to complete the courses normally required for high school graduation (instead of taking a GED or high school equivalency test).[2714] High school diploma programs are offered in most jails and prisons, and in adult schools and community colleges throughout California.[2715] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In most adult high school diploma programs, you can choose to enroll in traditional classes, or to complete courses at your own pace through individual study and regular check-ins with teachers.[2716] In addition, some programs also allow you to complete correspondence courses through mail or email with teachers (for details on distance learning, see PG. 1076; for correspondence programs, see PG. 1079). After completing all of the required courses, you will have to pass an “exit” exam, called the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) to receive your high school diploma.[2717] All students in California public schools must pass the CAHSEE before they are awarded a high school diploma. This includes people who earn their diploma while incarcerated.

  <p>
    How much time will it take to earn my high school diploma?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, life circumstances, and learning preferences. Depending on the program you enroll in, you might work toward your diploma individually, at your own pace; or you might work with a teacher who creates assignment deadlines and a long-term schedule for you.[2718] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GENERAL TIPS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’ve already completed many of the courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, an adult high school diploma program is likely a faster route for you than the GED.If you haven’t completed many high school courses, the GED will probably be a faster path to your high school equivalency certificate.But consider, if you have not taken many high school courses yet, and you have some time to spend on your high school education, you might prefer a diploma program because it can be an opportunity to explore new subjects and skills that you won’t learn in a GED program.[2719] Warning: watch out for scam programs, which will try to charge you money for a fake diploma. See PG. [] for details.

  <p>
    How much money will it cost to earn my high school diploma through a program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: As part of the Literacy Program, high school level classes should be available at no cost to you. However, not all facilities offer a high school diploma program; some offer GED study courses instead.[2720] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: A high school diploma program should be available at no cost to you.[2721] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: If your facility offers a high school diploma program, it should be available at no cost to you.[2722] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: While high school diploma programs are generally offered at no cost, if you have a high balance in your trust account, your facility may decide to deduct some or all of the cost for some programs from your account.[2723] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adult high school diploma programs may be available in adult schools or community colleges near you for free or at low cost. Many schools provide adult high school classes for free, and provide books and materials for free as well. Others may charge registration and tuition fees. (However, schools that charge fees may also offer financial aid to low-income students. Check with each school about fees and financial aid.)[2724] Also, community adult literacy programs may offer high school diploma courses and tutoring for free. (For a list of organizations that may offer this service, see Appendix A, PG. 1093.) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you choose a distance learning or correspondence program, regardless of whether you’re incarcerated or in the community, you may need to pay program fees and buy your own materials (for details about distance learning programs in general, see PG. 1076).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WARNING: Be careful when choosing a high school diploma program. In recent years, the federal government has shut down several degree programs that were charging money for fake diplomas.[2725] These programs are scams. To avoid being scammed by a fake diploma program, watch out for the following clues[2726]:The program seems too good to be true. Getting a high school diploma requires time and effort. If a program lets you get a diploma without taking classes or tests, it is probably fake. The program offers free tests or classes, but charges for the diploma itself. This is a dead giveaway that the program is illegitimate. The program claims to be affilitated with the federal government. The federal government does not offer high school diploma progams. Only the states approve such programs.

  <p>
    How do I find and enroll in a high school diploma program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: Soon after you enter prison, your Unit Team or Education Staff should review your assessment (from county jail, see PG. 1048) and recommend classes for you. If you don’t have a high school credential, the facility will enroll you in literacy classes designed to lead up to a high school diploma (or a GED, if your facility offers a GED program).[2727] Ask your Education Advisor if you have questions about enrolling in classes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: If you are in a California state facility you may be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP). Ask your Correctional Counselor or Education Department staff if you have questions about the diploma program or VEP. Remember, to enroll in any education program, you must have a TABE score on file (see PG. 1048).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: If you’ve completed some high school in the past, and if your current skills are at a high school grade level (9-12), you should be enrolled in the high school diploma program at your facility. Education Department staff will review your high school transcript (if you have one) and TABE scores and decide whether you can enroll.[2728] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: Check with your jail’s education staff to find out whether high school diploma courses are offered and how to enroll.[2729]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit any public library or community bookstore to find free or low-cost high school level study materials, including books you may need for classes, as well as lessons you can work through on your own. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Contact any public library, adult school, or community college to ask about free or low-cost adult high school diploma programs near you.[2730]

    Helpful HintFinding a High School Diploma Program
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TIP 1: Many community colleges offer dual enrollment programs or continuing education programs, which allow you to earn an adult high school diploma or equivalency certificate AND get started on earning college credits at the same time.[2731] TIP 2: If you have meaningful school, work, or life experience, find out if you can make it count toward your diploma. Some adult schools or programs might give you credit for past high school work, job training, work experience, community service, military service, or self-study. Ask the individual school or program if it will do this.[2732]
