          <h3><a id="_Toc448153246"></a>What are my options if I get a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit”?</h3>
          <p class="text">To figure out when the third day is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to pay or move. </p>
          <p class="text">(1) <strong>One choice</strong> is that you can move out during the 3 days. If you move out at this time, technically, the landlord CANNOT file a court eviction against you. However, some landlords try to do so anyway. If this happens, you should call a legal aid office immediately; see a list of legal aid providers across California on PG. 1286 that may be able to assist you.</p>
          <p><strong>Also, even if you move out within the 3 days, the landlord can later sue you for past rent due. Most landlords will not bother with this.</strong></p>
          <p class="text">(2) <strong>Another choice</strong> is to pay the rent. If you decide to pay, you should pay the ENTIRE AMOUNT that the notice asks for, before the three days are up. Make sure that you get a receipt. If you cannot pay the full amount, you may be better off not paying anything —unless you can agree on a payment schedule with the landlord. If you reach such an agreement, make sure it is in writing and keep a copy of the agreement.</p>
          <p class="text">If you offer the full amount asked for within the 3 days, the landlord MUST ACCEPT the money from you. If you think the landlord might refuse your money, take along a friend to be a witness just in case. After the 3 days, the landlord does not have to accept any money from you. If you decide to try to pay the landlord even though the 3 days are up, you should get a RECEIPT and ask the landlord to agree IN WRITING not to evict you. If the landlord refuses to agree to that, the landlord may still try to evict you.</p>
