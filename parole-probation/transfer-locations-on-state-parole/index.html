        <h1>Transfer Locations on State Parole</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="PP_Transferstateparole"></a><a id="_Toc448152830"></a>Transfer Locations on State Parole</h2>
        <p><em>In this section, you will learn how to request that your parole be transferred: from one county to another county, or from California to a different state. </em></p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152831"></a>I want to transfer my parole to another county in california. How can I do that? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL TIP—REQUEST TRANSFER WHILE INCARCERATED:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If possible, you should make the request for transfer while you are still in prison — when your CDCR Form 611: Release Program Study is being prepared. For more information about Form 611, see Appendix S, PG. 333.</p>
        <p>You can make this request either while you are still incarcerated (recommended!) or after you have been released into the community. If your transfer request is denied, you may challenge the denial by filing a 602 appeal (see above PG. 171).</p>
        <h4>HOW TO REQUEST a transfer WHILE YOU’RE INCARCERATED:</h4>
        <p>Ask your correctional counselor to help you fill out a Transfer Investigation Request form (TIR) and to submit it on your behalf. Try to work with the correctional counselor whenever possible.</p>
        <p>In filling out your TIR, explain the reasons why being in your requested county will help you be more successful in rehabilitation and reentry. You should also provide supporting documents that back up these reasons, such as letters from supportive family members, from your doctor, and/or from a potential employer..Submit these supporting documents along with yourTransfer Investigation Request (TIR).<sup><a href="#footnote-540" id="footnote-ref-540">[515]</a></sup> </p>
        <p>If you are a “lifer” (a person serving a life sentence), your correctional counselor should submit your TIR to the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH). Most likely, the BPH will make a decision after discussing your request with the district attorney who is responsible for your case. </p>
        <p>The BPH could deny your transfer request if: </p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It believes denying your request will better protect the safety of the victi</strong><a id="victimparoletransfer"></a><strong>m; </strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It believes denying your request will better protect the public’s safety;</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You don’t have proof of a work or educational program in your requested county; </strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You don’t have family or any other support system in your requested county.<sup><a href="#footnote-541" id="footnote-ref-541">[516]</a></sup></strong></p>
        <p>If you are not a “lifer,” the correctional counselor should submit your TIR to the Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), which will make the final decision about your transfer.<sup><a href="#footnote-542" id="footnote-ref-542">[517]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4>HOW TO REQUEST a transfer after you are released:</h4>
        <p>Once you are released from prison, you do not need a special form to request a county transfer; you can and should ask your parole agent directly, in a dated letter and/or in person. We highly recommend that you put your request in writing, make a copy of your request before giving it to your parole agent, and keep your copy in a safe place — just in case you don’t receive a response and need to follow up with proof of your original request. </p>
        <p>In your request to your parole agent, explain the reasons why being in your requested county will help you be more successful in rehabilitation and reentry. You should also provide supporting documents that back up these reasons, such as letters from supportive family members, from your doctor, and/or from a potential employer.<sup><a href="#footnote-543" id="footnote-ref-543">[518]</a></sup> </p>
        <p><em>See the next question to learn about how your request should be processed by Parole.</em></p>
        <h5 class="question">Once I ask my parole agent for a county transfer, what should happen next?</h5>
        <p class="answer">After receiving your transfer request, your parole agent should prepare a Transfer Investigation Request form (TIR) and submit it to the parole unit supervisor. The supervisor should then consider the following factors:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Any need to protect the safety of the parolee, a victim, a witness, or other person;</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Any public concern that would reduce the chance that parole would be successfully completed;</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>A confirmed work offer or an educational or vocational program;</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The existence of family members who have strong ties with you and will support your efforts to complete parole successfully; and</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The presence or lack of any needed mental health treatment programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-544" id="footnote-ref-544">[519]</a></sup></strong></p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152832"></a><a id="PP_statetostatetransferstatesPPR"></a>I am on state parole — <em>or any other type of supervision in california </em>— and I want to transfer to another<em> </em>state. When and how can I do that?</h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE about interstate transfers:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">The Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision also governs the rules for all interstate transfers of state probation, including PRCS and mandatory supervision. </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Parole will allow only a limited number of transfers to each county. For this reason, even if all of the factors listed above are in your favor, your transfer request may still be denied. With this in mind, when submitting your request, you should put together the strongest application possible. Gather as much support as you can, especially from your parole agent, correctional counselor, and any other government officials you know — such as judges, district attorneys, and public defenders. It would also be great to get the support of leaders from the community you want to transfer to. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The information below about transferring supervision between states applies not just to state parole, but to <em>ALL forms of community supervision</em>. Keep reading if you are on state parole; county probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision; or federal probation, supervised release or parole.</p>
        <p><em>First, some background:</em> The rules for “interstate parole transfer” (transferring parole from one state to another) are set by a legal agreement called <em>the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-545" id="footnote-ref-545">[520]</a></sup> The Interstate Compact applies in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<sup><a href="#footnote-546" id="footnote-ref-546">[521]</a></sup> If you are classfied as a sex offender requesting transfer to a different state, special additional rules apply to you (see PG. 197).</p>
        <h4>IF YOU ARE currently INCARCERATED:</h4>
        <p>At the earliest, California can send an interstate transfer request for you 120 days before your expected release date (ERD).<sup><a href="#footnote-547" id="footnote-ref-547">[522]</a></sup> The receiving state should respond within 45 days of receiving the transfer request.<sup><a href="#footnote-548" id="footnote-ref-548">[523]</a></sup> The process can be sped up in an emergency.<sup><a href="#footnote-549" id="footnote-ref-549">[524]</a></sup></p>
        <h4>IF YOU have already been released:</h4>
        <p>If you are living in the community, you may request to transfer your parole to a new state if you meet basic eligibility requirements (listed below under Step 1).</p>
        <p><strong>STEP 1: Confirm that you meet the basic eligibility requirements to request an interstate parole transfer. The basic requirements are:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">As of the time your application is submitted to your requested state, you have 90 days (3 months) or more, or an undecided amount of time, left to serve on parole; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You have a valid supervision plan; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You have not had parole revoked and have no pending parole revocation charges; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>EITHER</em> You are a resident of the receiving state <em>OR</em> You have family that lives in the state and is willing and able to assist you (regardless of whether you decide to live with them), and you can obtain employment or have another means of supporting yourself;<sup><a href="#footnote-550" id="footnote-ref-550">[525]</a></sup> AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have paid off your restitution orders in California, unless a judge finds that releasing you to transfer parole to another state would be “in the interests of justice.”<sup><a href="#footnote-551" id="footnote-ref-551">[526]</a></sup></ol>
        <p><em>NOTE: Even if you do not meet these requirements, California and the receiving state (the state you wish to transfer to) may agree to grant your transfer request if they find “good cause” (very good reason) to do so.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-552" id="footnote-ref-552">[527]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2: If you meet the eligibility requirements, communicate your transfer request to your parole agent. It’s best to make this request in writing so that you have a paper trail, and keep a copy of it in a safe place. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3: Your parole agent should confirm that you meet the eligibility requirements. He or she must then submit a transfer request to the CDCR’s California Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 4: If the CDCR approves, it should send the transfer request to the receiving state. The receiving state should then decide whether to approve your transfer request.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-553" id="footnote-ref-553">[528]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 5: If the receiving state approves your request, you should then be transferred.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-554" id="footnote-ref-554">[529]</a></sup></p>
        <h4>SPEC<a id="sexoffenderstatetransferrule"></a>IAL RULES FOR SEX OFFENDERS to TRANSFER PAROLE TO NEW STATE:</h4>
        <p>If you are registered as a sex offender and want to transfer parole to a different state, then In addition to the rules laid out above, there are special rules that apply to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-555" id="footnote-ref-555">[530]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 1: To get the process started, talk to your correctional counselor (if you are still incarcerated) or your parole agent (if you are out on parole). </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2: The parole agent should determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements. If the requirements are met, the parole agent should submit a transfer application to the CDCR’s Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3: If the CDCR approves the transfer, the request will be sent to the receiving state.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-556" id="footnote-ref-556">[531]</a></sup></p>
