    Helpful HintTax Credits to Reduce Cost of Private Health Care
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re planning to buy a private health care plan, and you want tax credits to help reduce your costs, have the following information ready when you apply:[1438] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Birthdates and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of all household members. For Covered California, a “family” is defined as the person who files taxes as head of household, plus all dependents claimed on those taxes.If you are NOT a citizen, you must have your immigrant status information. Proof of citizenship or immigration status is required only for individuals in your family who are applying for health care coverage. You are allowed to apply for your child even if you aren’t eligible for coverage because of your immigration status. Applying for your eligible child won’t affect your immigration status, or your chances of getting immigrant or citizenship status.[1439] Also, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has stated that they will not use information obtained through health care applications for immigration enforcement purposes.[1440]Current income and latest tax return information for your household. You may be asked to follow up with documents proving your income. If you earn wages, acceptable proof may include: your most recent W-2, a recent pay stub, a letter from your employer on official office letterhead, or a copy of a check paid to you as wages.[1441] Information about any health insurance that you or any household member receives through a job.[1442]
