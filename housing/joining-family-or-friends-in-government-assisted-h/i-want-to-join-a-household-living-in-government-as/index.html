  <p>
    I want to join a household living in government-assisted housing. can I?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    FIRST, LEARN ABOUT THE CRIMINAL BANS IN GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Return to the section above about bans to understand when there are required bans vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing has discretion (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG. 408 of this Chapter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on your background and on the policies of the PHA or owner. The same eligibility and exclusion rules apply if you want to join a family living in government-assisted housing as those that would apply if you were applying on your own—see PG. 398. As with new applicants there are a few limited situations in which a PHA or owner must reject the new family member[1216] (see PG. 404 for bans based on your criminal record). But in the vast majority of situations, the PHA or owner has BROAD DISCRETION to accept or reject you as an additional household member, just like for new applicants. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The rules for adding family members to an assisted household are different for every assisted housing program and are determined locally. You should be able to find these rules FOR YOUR PROGRAM. You can look in the following places:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The PHA’s Annual Plan
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The PHA’s Admission and Occupancy Plan (ACOP)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The lease for public housing
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Administrative Plan for the Section 8 Voucher program
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The lease and/or house rules for all other government-assisted programs[1217] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The PHA’s website for these plans
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By asking the PHA and/or owner for a copy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Depending on the type of criminal activity and whether or not if happened on the government-assisted property, it could disqualify not just you, but your entire family from meeting the eligibility requirements of the assisted housing program! (Again, read PG. 397 to better understand eligibility requirements.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Does the family in that household have to report the addition to the home? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SPECIAL RULE FOR SECTION 8 VOUCHERS: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The PHA is actually required to have a written policy in its “Administrative Plan” about temporary absences for anyone in the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, so if you are in that program, there will definitely be a local policy! 24 C.F.R. § 982.54(d)(10). The Voucher program’s temporary absence policy must state whether or when the family may be absent—including for imprisonment; the amount of time you are allowed to be absent for; and how to resume your housing assistance. 24 C.F.R. § 982.312(e).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. In general, if a family is adding an adult member to the household, they (1) must notify the PHA and government-assisted owner AND (2) in most cases, receive the PHA’s and government-assisted owner’s approval for the new addition to the household.[1218] Ask the PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing what the rules are for reporting a new member, and what the timeframe is for when you have to report a change to who is living in your household. It is very important to follow all of their rules!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want to return back to my government-assisted housing unit after a brief period of incarceration. can I do that? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on the program. And it depends on the criminal activity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As always, anyone joining or returning to government-assisted housing MUST meet ALL of the eligibility requirements for that housing program, for that PHA, and for the owner (if there is one). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For exclusions (bans) based on your criminal record, read PG. 404 of this chapter to understand when there are required bans vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing has discretion (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG. 408 of this Chapter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For most federal government-assisted housing programs, the local PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing may develop rules and policies regarding temporary absences, and many do have such policies. You need to check with the PHA and owner that oversee the housing unit you want to join about their policies.[1219] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Since your return could harm the entire family’s ability to stay in government-assisted housing, it’s a good idea for the family to discuss these issues with the PHA and/or owner of the government-assisted housing BEFORE you return from your brief absence. If that is not possible, there are legal defenses to an eviction action if it is brought against the entire family in court. This HOUSING CHAPTER does not cover eviction law and all of its defenses, so if this is your issue, you will need to contact a legal aid organization that specializes in eviction defense. Go to PG. 1286 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help.
