  <p>
    I had a traffic ticket that was pending (unresolved) when I was incarcerated. What might have happened to it?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were formerly incarcerated in a California state prison: Under state law, the DMV must dismiss most non-felony traffic tickets that were pending when you went to prison. A ticket is “pending” when the court has not yet made a decision in the case (meaning, never ordered you to pay the fine). Only tickets for misdemeanor traffic offenses and infractions can be dismissed under this law. Parking tickets CANNOT be dismissed this way.[2130] PLEASE NOTE: this rule only applies to people who were incarcerated in state prisons!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, your traffic ticket CANNOT be dismissed if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You got the ticket while you were on parole;[2131]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The ticket is for an offense that would require the DMV to automatically revoke or suspend your driver license if you were convicted;[2132]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are serving your sentence in county jail under Realignment.[2133]
