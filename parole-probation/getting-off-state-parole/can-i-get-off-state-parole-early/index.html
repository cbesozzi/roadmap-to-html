          <h1>Can I get off state parole early?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152795"></a>Can I get off state parole early?</h3>
          <p class="text">It depends. This is usually a possibility, but Parole has “discretion” — meaning, power to decide as it sees fit — with some legal limits on how it makes this decision.</p>
          <p class="text">Most people have the legal right to a “presumption” — meaning, a default assumption — that they should get off parole early. Based on this assumption, most people have a “presumptive discharge date” or PDD. Learn more about PDDs on PG. 170.</p>
          <p class="text">Some people do not have a PDD because of the nature of their commitment offense and when it occurred. See Appendix B, PG. 292, for a list of people who do not have PDDs. </p>
          <p class="text">If you have a PDD, then by law, the exact timing of your PDD depends on your underlying commitment offense and when it occurred. The PDD periods can be found in California Penal Code Sections 3000, 3000.1, 3001.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-401" id="footnote-ref-401">[383]</a></sup></sup> If you fit into more than one category, the longer period applies. See Appendix B, PG. 292, for a list of current PDD lengths.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152796"></a>What should happen when I reach my presumptive discharge date (PDD)?	</h3>
          <p class="text">If you are entitled to a PDD by law, then the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) <em>must</em> conduct a discharge review hearing within <em>30 days</em> of your PDD.<sup><a href="#footnote-402" id="footnote-ref-402">[384]</a></sup> At this hearing, BPH must decide whether to let you off early based on your parole agent’s report (submitted to the BPH on CDCR Form 1502).<sup><a href="#footnote-403" id="footnote-ref-403">[385]</a></sup> In this report, your parole agent will make a recommendation either for or against letting you off parole early,<sup><a href="#footnote-404" id="footnote-ref-404">[386]</a></sup> considering factors like: </p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><a id="StateParole_Definition_ParoleAdjustment"></a><strong><em>Parole adjustment: Whether you followed your parole conditions, and whether you were involved in any criminal behavior or activities.</em> Specifically, this factor concerns the stability of your living situation, employment, education, and/or vocational training; your ability to be financially independent in the community; your compliance with special parole conditions; your mental health status and compliance with any required treatment; and your avoidance of any gang involvement.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>Restitution payment:</em> <em>The amount of your restitution balance, and any efforts to satisfy your restitution balance</em>.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>Criminal history:</em> <em>Your compliance with any conviction-related registration requirements</em> (for example, sex offense, arson, gang-related, or drug-related registration requirements — refer to the chart on PG. 165);<sup><a href="#footnote-405" id="footnote-ref-405">[387]</a></sup> whether your commitment offense or other past convictions were serious or violent;<sup><a href="#footnote-406" id="footnote-ref-406">[388]</a></sup> whether you used a weapon or possessed a firearm during your commitment offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-407" id="footnote-ref-407">[389]</a></sup></strong></p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS A “<a id="PP_StateParole_MistakeofFactDefinition"></a>MISTAKE OF FACT”?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">A “mistake of fact” is a legal term used to describe an error that someone makes because he or she doesn’t know the facts of what really happened. </p>
          <h5 class="question">What if CDCR or Parole staff makes a mistake in the report? </h5>
          <p class="answer">If your parole agent (or any other CDCR or Parole staff) makes a “mistake of fact” in the report to the BPH recommending to keep you on parole, you can file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal challenging the mistake.<sup><a href="#footnote-408" id="footnote-ref-408">[390]</a></sup> The steps for filing a 602 appeal are described on PG. 171. If the reviewers of your 602 appeal find that there was a significant mistake in your parole agent’s report to the BPH, and that this mistake led to you being kept on parole past your PDD, they can change the recommendation and ask the BPH to reconsider its decision so that you will be discharged from parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-409" id="footnote-ref-409">[391]</a></sup></p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “GOOD CAUSE”?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">“Good cause” basically means “good reason.” According to CDCR, to find good cause for a decision is to find it more likely than not — by a “preponderance of the evidence” — that the decision is based on true facts and solid reasons. (15 Cal. Code Regs.§ 2000(b)(50)).</p>
          <p class="answer">Alternatively, if there is no mistake in the parole agent’s report, but you believe that the BPH has decided to keep you on parole without “good cause” (a good reason), you may want to challenge the BPH decision directly; in that case, you do not need to file a 602 appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-410" id="footnote-ref-410">[392]</a></sup> For information about how to challenge a BPH action directly, go to PG. 173.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152797"></a>What are my rights DURING the presumptive discharge Date (PDD) review process?</h3>
          <p class="text">You have the right to see a written record of the BPH’s decision about whether to keep you on parole. The BPH is required to make a written record of its decision, and to send a copy of that decision to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-411" id="footnote-ref-411">[393]</a></sup> If it is more than 30 days past your PDD and you did not receive written notice of the BPH’s decision, you may be entitled to IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE FROM PAROLE if the BPH failed to make a decision in your case. See PG. 174 below for more information.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152798"></a>Do I have a right to appear at the discharge review hearing before the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH)?</h3>
          <p class="text">No. You do not have a right to appear in person at the BPH review hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-412" id="footnote-ref-412">[394]</a></sup> But, if CDCR staff makes a “mistake of fact”<sup><a href="#footnote-413" id="footnote-ref-413">[395]</a></sup> in the report that goes to BPH (see definition above on PG. 171), then you can file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal asking for reconsideration, and clarifying the mistake that has been made.<sup><a href="#footnote-414" id="footnote-ref-414">[396]</a></sup> See the steps for filing a 602 appeal on PG. 171.</p>
