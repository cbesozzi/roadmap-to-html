  <p>
    My conviction was for a felony and I was sentenced to state prison. What, if anthing, could I do to get it expunged?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unfortunately, if you were sentenced to state prison, or spent any time in a CDCR facility (including a prison camp or hospital) for your conviction (for any reason), your conviction does NOT qualify for expungement OR for reduction to a misdemeanor.[2986] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BUT, your conviction may still be eligible for Reclassification or Resentencing under Proposition 47, or you may be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation and/or a Governor’s Pardon. (For information on Reclassification and Resentencing under Proposition 47, see PG. 1178. For information on Certificates of Rehabilitation, see PG. 1184. For information on Governor’s Pardons, see PG. 1188.)
