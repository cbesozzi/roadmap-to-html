    How can I succeed in an interview?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is a list of the essential steps to prepare for and succeed in an interview with a potential employer. For more detailed information about each of these steps, please see the Appendix D, PG. 774.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thoughtfully answer each interview question.Ask your own questions.Practice beforehand!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If possible, you should try to do a practice (“mock”) interview before the real thing with your case manager, social worker, counselor, or even family or friends. Remember, even if you have your answers prepared on paper or in your head, things will sound different when you try to say them out loud!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be polite and confident during the interview.Follow-up after the interview.
  </p>
