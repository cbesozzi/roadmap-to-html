        <h3><a id="_Toc448153195"></a>Do I have any rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing rejects my rental application because of a background check/ tenant report?</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Yes.</em> The PHA or landlord must give you an “adverse action” notice letting you know it plans to take an action that could harm you based on information that showed up in your tenant report/background check.</strong><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1234" id="footnote-ref-1234">[1204]</a></sup></sup></span><strong> The notice must include the following information:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">The name and contact for the company that supplied the report;</ol>
        <ol class="text">A statement that the landlord, not the screening company, made the adverse decision; <em>and</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">Notice of your right to dispute the accuracy of the report and to receive a free copy of your report within 60 days.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1235" id="footnote-ref-1235">[1205]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
        <p><strong>EXTRA PROTECTIONS for the Public Housing program and the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program<em> ONLY</em>:</strong></p>
        <p class="textbox"><em>ONLY for these two government-assisted programs, PHAs must follow certain extra rules (set forth below). </em></p>
        <ul class="textbox">The PHA must make sure the criminal records are true and accurate.</ul>
        <p class="textbox">After the PHA has you sign a <em>release</em> of criminal records information and submits that release to the law enforcement agency that holds the criminal records, it may receive a response that there is a match based on your name, date of birth, and social security number. The PHA cannot deny admission based on this information alone; the PHA must verify the match with a positive fingerprint comparison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1236" id="footnote-ref-1236">[1206]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <ul class="textbox">The PHA must give you notice of any proposed action that could harm you.</ul>
        <p class="textbox">A PHA must notify the household of any proposed action that could harm you (called an “adverse action” notice). The PHA must also provide a copy of the criminal record information to the person who was the subject of the record—as well as to the applicant, if that’s a different person.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1237" id="footnote-ref-1237">[1207]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <ul class="textbox">The PHA must give you an opportunity to challenge the criminal record information. </ul>
        <p class="textbox">The person whose information was relied on must be given an opportunity to dispute the proposed negative action.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1238" id="footnote-ref-1238">[1208]</a></sup></sup> NOTE: Even if you don’t have an automatic legal right to a review hearing, you can always ask for one! To learn more about challenging a denial to government-assisted housing, please go to PG. 408.</p>
        <ul class="textbox">The PHA Must Protect the Confidentiality of Your Records:<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1239" id="footnote-ref-1239">[1209]</a></sup></sup></span> </ul>
        <p class="textbox">Under federal law, PHAs must have a system to: (1) Protect the confidentiality of applicants’ criminal records; (2) Guard against improper sharing of those records; AND<em> </em>(3) Destroy the records once<em> </em>their purpose has been achieved.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1240" id="footnote-ref-1240">[1210]</a></sup></sup></p>
