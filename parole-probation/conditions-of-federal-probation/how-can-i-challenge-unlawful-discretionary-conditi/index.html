  <p>
    How can I challenge unlawful discretionary conditions that were added on to my federal probation?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Within 14 days of your sentencing hearing, you must file a Notice of Appeal with the Clerk of the Court where you were convicted.[795] Once this occurs, you should contact the Federal Public Defender’s Office in your federal judicial district. For a list of Federal Public Defender’s Offices in California, visit: http://www.fd.org/docs/defender-contacts/federal-public-and-community-defender-directory.pdf?sfvrsn=9. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: The same rules and processes apply for challenging discretionary conditions of Supervised Release as for federal probation (refer back to PG. 106 for challenging conditions of federal probation.)
