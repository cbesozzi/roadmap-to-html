              <h3><a id="_Toc448153215"></a>What is a ‚Äúlive-in aide?‚Äù</h3>
              <p class="text">A live-in aide is a person who <em>resides with</em> one or more elderly, near elderly, or disabled persons, and who is <em>essential to the care</em> and well-being of that individual. The live-in aide is not obligated to support the person and would not be living in the unit except to provide the required services.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1263" id="footnote-ref-1263">[1233]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
              <p class="text">A live-in aide is NOT a household member. If you are a live-in aide, your income will be <em>excluded</em> from calculating the rent for the assisted unit. However, the family that lives in the unit could request an extra bedroom for the live-in aide and then be required to pay the standard amount for the larger bedroom size.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153216"></a>Can I be someone‚Äôs live-in aide in government-assisted housing if I have criminal record?</h3>
              <p class="text">Maybe. If you have a criminal record, you may be able to reside in a government-assisted housing unit as a <em>live-in aide</em>, but you will need to be screened (see next question).</p>
              <p class="text">Depending on the policies of the PHA or owner, the criminal background check conducted for a live-in aide may be less strict than the one used for admitting a new tenant because a live-in aide is <em>not</em> considered a true household member.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153217"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my criminal background if I am someone‚Äôs live-in aide?</h3>
              <p class="text">Yes. The PHA and owner can screen you for issues related to your being present in the assisted unit. Most PHAs and owners will screen live-in aides for their criminal background <em>using the same or similar criteria</em> as they use for admissions (read PG.¬†404 for the criminal record-related bans in federal government-housing, including which ones are <em>required</em> versus which ones are <em>allowed</em>).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1264" id="footnote-ref-1264">[1234]</a></sup></sup></span></p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153218"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my credit history if I am someone‚Äôs live-in aide?</h3>
              <p class="text">No. The <em>PHA or owner should not screen you for your credit history if you are a live-in aide. </em>Your credit history has nothing to do with the family‚Äôs ability to pay for the unit‚Äîso you should not be screened for credit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1265" id="footnote-ref-1265">[1235]</a></sup></sup></p>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448153219"></a>I was excluded from being someone‚Äôs live-in aide based on my criminal record. What can I do? </h3>
              <p class="text">THE <em>PERSON REQUIRING AID</em> SHOULD ASK FOR A REVIEW HEARING. Go to PG.¬†408 to learn how (s)he can challenge this denial of you as his/her live-in aide.</p>
              <p class="text">There may be situations in which the disabled/elderly resident needing the care has great difficulty finding a live-in aide, or that you meet some unique need of that individual requiring care. In such situations, the disabled/elderly individual needing the live-in aide may request a <em>reasonable accommodation</em> for a disability by asking the PHA or owner <em>to waive its strict screening criteria, and allow the person with the criminal record to reside in the unit as a live-in aide due to the special function he or she plays in the tenant‚Äôs life</em>. </p>
