  <p>
    What arrest records can be sealed by the court?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any arrest that did NOT lead to a conviction is eligible to be sealed. You can ask to have your arrest record sealed if you were arrested, but: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA NEVER filed charges against you in court;[3118] OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA offered you a diversion program instead of filing charges (and you successfully completed it);[3119] OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA filed charges against you, but the case was dismissed;[3120] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA filed charges, but the judge sent you to a diversion program instead (and you successfully completed it);[3121] OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    what is “Factual innocence”?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Factual innocence” means that “no reasonable cause exists” for a judge to think that you did what you were arrested for. It is a very high and difficult standard to meet. In most cases, even if your case was dismissed or you were acquitted by a jury, a judge is still not likely to find you “factually innocent.” Examples of factual innocence include: the police arrested you because they thought you were someone else; what you did was not actually illegal; or your arrest was the result of police misconduct.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA filed charges against you, but you were acquitted at trial;[3122] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA filed charges, you were convicted at trial, but the judge set aside your conviction.
