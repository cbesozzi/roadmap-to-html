  <p>
    How could I be sentenced for a revocation of federal parole?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the Parole Commission finds by a “preponderance of the evidence,” (that it is more likely than not) that you violated a condition of the parole, the Commission may take any of the following actions:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Continue your supervision on federal parole, which can include:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Reprimanding you;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Modifying (changing) your conditions of release;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Referring you to a community corrections center for all or part of the remainder of your original sentence;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Revoke your parole, and send you back to prison.[985]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In determining whether to revoke parole for not paying a fine, restitution, court costs or assessment, and/or court-ordered child support or alimony payment that was a condition of your release on supervision, the U.S. Parole Commission must consider your employment status, earning ability, financial resources, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the matter. Revocation shall not be ordered unless you are found to be deliberately evading or refusing compliance.[986] (Learn more about court-ordered debt in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 811).
