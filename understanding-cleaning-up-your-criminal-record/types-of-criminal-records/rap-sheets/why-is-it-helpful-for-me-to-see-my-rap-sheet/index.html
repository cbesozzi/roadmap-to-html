  <h1>Why is it helpful for me to see my RAP sheet?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153873"></a>Why is it helpful for me to see my RAP sheet?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">There are 4 main reasons why it’s important to see your RAP sheet and know exactly what it says:</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>RAP sheets often contain mistakes</em>, such as incomplete or incorrect information. It’s important to <em>find and correct any errors </em>BEFORE the wrong information has a chance to harm you. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>You will have an accurate record of your criminal history</em>, so that you know what information certain employers, professional licensing agencies, landlords, banks, or others might see about you. To learn more about what information employers and licensing agencies CAN and CAN’T consider, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 687. To learn more about what information private landlords, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and owners of government-assisted housing CAN and CANNOT consider, see the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 368.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>You will be better prepared to answer questions about your criminal history</em>. If you know what is in your record, you can plan ahead and figure out how to talk about it in a more positive light. For more information about how to talk about your criminal history in a job interview, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 687.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>It’s necessary for cleaning up your record</em>! Your RAP sheet will help you figure out which remedies you qualify for and which are the best options for you. In addition, you will need the details from your RAP sheet to fill out forms and complete the process of cleaning up your record.</ol>
