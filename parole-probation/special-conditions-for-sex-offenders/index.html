<p>
  Special Conditions for Sex Offenders
</p>

<p>
  I’m required to register as a sex offender. what other mandatory parole conditions apply to me?
</p>

<p>
  Listed below are mandatory conditions of parole imposed on all people who are required to register as sex offenders (also called “290 registrants”):
</p>

<p>
  REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER — If you are required to register as a sex offender, and you “willfully” (intentionally) do not register, you are guilty of a new criminal charge for failure to register as a sex offender.[464] If you were originally convicted of a misdemeanor, then the new charge for failure to register will also be a misdemeanor. If you were originally convicted of a felony, the new charge for failure to register will be a felony.[465] You must register with the local chief of police (or, if your city doesn’t have a local police department, you must register with the local county sheriff).[466]
</p>

<p>
  GPS TRACKER — If you are required to register as a sex offender, you must wear a GPS tracking device (usually an ankle bracelet) while on parole.[467]
</p>

<p>
  RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS — Before 2015, all 290 registrants were prohibited from living within 2,000 feet of any school or park where children regularly gather. A 2015 California Supreme Court case relaxed these restrictions.[468] (See summary on PG. [].) Currently, this residency restriction still applies to 290 registrants convicted of specific sex acts involving children.[469] Residency restrictions for all other 290 registrants are determined on a case-by-case basis.[470]  
</p>

<p>
  Key DEFINITIONS for people required to register as sex offenders
</p>

<p>
  “DISTANCE” is measured by a straight line between the main entrance of your residence and the boundary of the nearest park or school — not by driving or walking distance. (15 CCR § 3571(e)(4).)You are “transient” if you don’t have a residence. Your “residence” is any place where:
</p>

<p>
  You spend 1 day or night at the same address every 
</p>

<p>
  week for two or more weeks in a row; 
</p>

<p>
  You spend 2 or more consecutive (back-to-back) days or nights living at the same address; 
</p>

<p>
  You have a key to the building “and there is a pattern of residency”; or
</p>

<p>
  The parole agent finds evidence that you live there, such as your clothes or toiletries (15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3590(a)).
</p>

<p>
  REQUIREMENTS FOR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRANTS — If you are required to register as a sex offender, you must re-register every year, within five business days of your birthday, with the chief of police in the city where you live (or, if there is no city police department, with the county sheriff).[471] EXCEPTION: If you are not living in one place, you must register more often as a “transient” sex offender (read the “Important!” text box below). 
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT! Information for “transient” sex offenders: If you are not living in one place (for example, if you are homeless and don’t have a stable place to sleep), then Parole considers you “transient,” and you must register with the chief of police in the city where you are physically present (or, if there is no police department in that city, register with the county sheriff). If you move to a new city, you must inform the chief of police in that city (or, if there is no police department in that city, inform the county sheriff).[472] If you don’t have a stable place to live, you should re-register AT LEAST EVERY 30 DAYS with the chief of police in the city where you are currently present (or, if there is no police department in that city, re-register with the county sheriff), no matter how long you have been present there.[473]
</p>

<p>
  Are there exceptions to these mandatory special parole conditions for registered sex offenders?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. There are 2 types of exceptions:
</p>

<p>
  Your parole agent should make exceptions to these conditions if (a) you are mentally ill, and (b) you are either living in a licensed mental health facility or need medical care in such a facility.[474]
</p>

<p>
  If you are homeless, you may stay at locations such as bridges, encampments, and bus stops that are closer than 2,000 feet to a school or park, but you must keep your parole agent informed of where you are.[475] Also, if you are homeless, you may stay temporarily at an address without establishing “residency” if the stay is for approved work, receiving medical services, or conducting legitimate business (for example: if you are working or completing a task at a licensed business, professional, or government building).[476]

<p>
  important LEGAL UPDATE: 
</p>

<p>
  HELP FROM THE PRISON LAW OFFICE
</p>

<p>
  The Prison Law Office (PLO) has published an information letter on the status of California’s sex offender laws, as well as a sample petition for writ of habeas corpus to challenge residency restrictions. Get a copy of this letter by writing to Prison Law Office, General Delivery, San Quentin CA 94964, OR find it online at http://prisonlaw.com/pdfs/SexOffender-Prop83,May2015.pdf. The PLO updates these resources regularly.

<p>
  In re Taylor &PROP. 83 CHALLENGES
</p>

<p>
  Proposition 83 (“Jessica’s Law”) imposed residency restrictions on people convicted of certain sex offenses, limiting where they could live. This law has been challenged as being so unreasonable, vague, and overbroad that it violates constitutional rights.[477] In a number of counties, judges have granted “temporary relief” to individual parolees —excusing them from having to follow the residency restrictions under Jessica’s Law.[478]In March 2015, in the In re Taylor case, the California Supreme Court decided that certain residency restrictions are unconstitutional as applied to all sex offender parolees in San Diego County.[479] In response to this decision, the CDCR announced that it will no longer enforce the Proposition 83 residency restrictions against all 290 registrants as a blanket prohibition. Rather, residency restrictions barring 290 registsrants from living within 2,000 feet of a school or park apply only to individuals convicted of certain offenses involving children – namely Lewd Acts with a Child Under 14[480] and Continuous Sexual Abuse of a Child.[481] Residency restrictions for all other 290 registrants are determined on a case-by-case basis, based on criminal history and other relevant information.[482]    If you are required to register as a sex offender on parole, you can contact your local county public defender’s office for more information.

  Special Conditions for Mentally Disordered Offenders (MDOs)
</p>

<p>
  What does it mean to be a “mentally disordered offender” (MDO) — and what mandatory special conditions apply to MDOs on parole? 
</p>

<p>
  Under state law, you may be classified as a “mentally disordered offender” (MDO) on parole only if: 
</p>

<p>
  You have been diagnosed with a serious mental illness that causes you to pose a substantial danger of physical harm to others, AND
</p>

<p>
  You have been sentenced to prison for an offense involving violence.[483]
</p>

<p>
  According to the CDCR, if you are a MDO, must receive inpatient treatment from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH)[484] as a mandatory condition of parole. 
</p>

<p>
  Who decides whether I’m a MDO? When does this happen?
</p>

<p>
  There are several steps to the MDO determination process:
</p>

<p>
  STEP 1: First, while you are in prison, CDCR mental health staff and a DSH psychologist or psychiatrist must screen you for classification as a MDO.[485] 
</p>

<p>
  STEP 2: If both agree that you qualify as a MDO, the CDCR should send certification papers to the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) stating that you have been found to be a MDO.[486] 
</p>

<p>
  STEP 3: The BPH must notify you that you’ll have to undergo DSH inpatient treatment as a parole condition.[487] The BPH must also notify you of your right to challenge the MDO finding.[488]
</p>

<p>
  I think I’ve been wrongly classified as a MDO. What can I do?
</p>

<p>
  You can challenge the CDCR’s finding that you are a MDO, which means requesting a hearing before the BPH. If you challenge the finding, the BPH must do the following:
</p>

<p>
  Have you evaluated by two independent mental health professionals, AND
</p>

<p>
  Hold a hearing before a BPH commissioner. 
</p>

<p>
  At the hearing, the state will be required to prove “by a preponderance of evidence” (that it’s more likely than not) that you’re a MDO — specifically, that (1) you’ve been diagnosed with a serious mental illness that causes you to pose a substantial danger of physical harm to others, AND (2) you were sentenced to prison for a violent offense.[489] If you want a lawyer at the hearing, the state must provide one for free.[490] 
</p>

<p>
  What if, at this hearing, the BPH commissioner decides to agree with the CDCR’s finding that you are a MDO? You can challenge that decision by filing a petition in the local county superior court to demand a jury trial. If you request a trial, the BPH must provide you with (1) a petition form and (2) instructions for filing the petition. At trial, the state must prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that you met the criteria of being classified as a MDO.[491] If you want a lawyer at trial, the state must provide one for free.
</p>

<p>
  I have been found to be a MDO. Can I ask to be treated as an outpatient?
</p>

<p>
  What is the Department of State Hospitals (DSH)?
</p>

<p>
  The DSH was created in 2012 to take over the functions of the now-defunct Department of Mental Health (DMH). DSH oversees inpatient mental health treatment facilities in California. 
</p>

<p>
  It might be possible. The normal rule is that if you are a MDO on parole, you must be placed in inpatient treatment (confined to a state hospital where you will live and receive mental health treatment) — unless the Department of State Hospitals (DSH) finds that you can be treated safely as an outpatient.[492] 
</p>

<p>
  After 60 days in DSH custody, you can request a hearing before a BPH commissioner to ask for outpatient status as a MDO (this means you would live in the community but go to a mental health hospital for treatment).[493] At the hearing, the DSH must show by “a preponderance of the evidence” (that it is more likely than not) that you require inpatient treatment.[494] Once you request this hearing, you have the right to a free appointed attorney (called a “panel attorney”)[495] and the appointment of two independent evaluators. If you disagree with the BPH commissioner’s decision, you may appeal it in county superior court (see below for more information).[496] 
</p>

<p>
  Once I have been found to be a MDO, when and how often will my MDO status be reviewed?
</p>

<p>
  The BPH must review your status as a MDO when you reach your presumptive discharge date (PDD: the date when you should be discharged early from parole, unless the BPH finds a good reason to keep you; see PG. 170). At that date, the BPH must decide to recommend either that you continue in your MDO inpatient placement, or that you be discharged.[497] If the BPH recommends that you continue in your MDO placement, it MUST hold re-commitment proceedings, which are similar to the original MDO commitment procedures (see PG. 187 for information about the initial MDO classification process that happens in prison).[498] Before you are re-committed, you should receive written notice of the decision.[499] If you are re-committed multiple times as a MDO, you could end up serving your entire parole term in a DSH hospital.[500] 
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS “RE-COMMITMENT”?
</p>

<p>
  Re-commitment is the process by which DSH decides that a person is still a MDO and must be confined in a DSH facility for another year.
