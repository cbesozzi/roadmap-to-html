</p>

<p>
  1) Male Community Reentry Program (MCRP)
</p>

<p>
  Summary: Enables men to complete their sentences in a residential setting, with greater freedom and privileges. Programming is particularly (though not exclusively) geared towards people with both mental health and substance abuse issues. Program Timeframe: Participants must have 30 to 180 days left in their sentences at the time of placement. This means you should begin asking your counselor about the program as you approach your final 180 days. One day in the program is equivalent to one day of incarceration.Supervision: On-site correctional staff and employees from the contracted facilities (listed below) supervise program participants 24 hours a day. Participants must also wear ankle monitors.Locations: Oroville (Butte County), Bakersfield (Kern County), and Los Angeles, CA (Los Angeles County).Contact: Butte County:              Jody Alsdurf, (530) 533-5272                                    Tri County Treatment                                    2740 Oro Dam Blvd                                    Oroville, CA 95966Kern County:               Jaime Contreras, (661) 861-6111, ex. 43                                    Turning Point of Central California                                    1100 Union Ave.                                    Bakersfield, CA 93307Los Angeles County:   Michael Brenner, (213) 251-2830                                    HealthRight360                                    2307 West 6th Street                                    Los Angeles, CA 90057
</p>

<p>
  Am I eligible for the Male Community Reentry Program (MCRP)?
</p>

<p>
  The MCRP accepts people with all levels of offenses from any institution in the state, so long as you have approximately 30 to 180 days left in your sentence at the time of placement in the program. To qualify for the program, your county of last legal residence must have been Butte County, Kern County, Los Angeles County, or San Diego County. If your county of last legal residence is elsewhere, you may still be able to participate in the MCRP if you transfer supervision to one of the four counties listed. 
</p>

<p>
  Certain people are automatically ineligible for the MCRP. If you meet any of the following criteria, you will not be considered for the program:
</p>

<p>
  You are listed on the sex offender registry pursuant to Penal Code section 290, are classified with an R-suffix denoting a past sexual offense, or have been convicted of a sexually violent offense as defined in Health and Safety Code section 6600.You have a Static Risk Assessment score of five or higher, which means the CDCR has predicted that you are likely to commit a violent offense upon release. This is calculated based on your age, gender, prior convictions, and rules violations.You have attempted to escape in the past five yearsYou have active or potential felony holds, warrants, or detainersYou have spent time in the Security Housing Unit or Psychiatric Security Unit within the last yearYou are classified as part of Security Threat Group IYou have engaged in A through C-class misconduct within the last year of being in custody. In general, this includes acts that are especially violent (murder, batter, assault), dangerous (arson, damage to valuable property), or dishonest (bribery, forgery of important records, attempts to escape). Notably, while it would typically be considered a class B or C offense, possession of alcohol/drugs may not necessarily disqualify you from the MCRP. 
</p>

<p>
  How do I apply for the MCRP? 
</p>

<p>
  The MCRP is a voluntary program, so you must initiate the application process yourself by letting your counselor know you are interested. The application process has three components, all of which your counselor will provide: the application itself, a contract agreeing to certain terms, and mandatory assessments. The assessments use information about your personal background to determine which programs and services will best aid your reentry to society. This includes your history of substance abuse, medical and mental health, education, family background, criminal history, and social functioning.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have completed these requirements, your application will go through a rigorous screening process lasting anywhere from 30 to 60 days. Medical staff, the warden, and a classification committee will all review your application and provide their input. If you are eligible, the committee may endorse you for placement. The committee makes decisions about placement on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>

<p>
  2) Custody to Community Transitional Reentry Program (CCTRP)**
</p>

<p>
  **Sometimes referred to as the Enhanced Alternative to Custody Program.
</p>

<p>
  Summary: Enables women to complete their sentences in a residential setting. Services are designed to prevent recidivism by addressing unique challenges women face upon reentry, such as gender-based trauma and mother-child relationships. From early morning until evening, participants partake in special activities and workshops, with some free time available. They may seek outside employment upon approval from the CCTRP staff, but a portion of earnings are held by the program until release.  Program Timeframe: Participants must have 45 days to two years left in their sentences at the time of placement. This means interested parties should start asking their counselors about the program as they approach the last two years of their sentences. One day in the program is equivalent to one day of incarceration.Supervision: On-site correctional staff and contracted employees from the WestCare Foundation supervise program participants 24 hours a day. Participants must also wear ankle monitors.Locations: San Diego (San Diego County), Santa Fe Springs (Los Angeles County), Bakersfield (Kern County), Stockton (San Joaquin County).Contact: San Diego:                   (619) 359-8266                                    Westcare                                    3050 Armstrong Street                                    San Diego, CA 92117Santa Fe Springs:         (562) 236-9390                                    Los Angeles Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse                                    11121 Bloomfield Ave.                                    Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670Bakersfield:                  (661) 447-4666                                     Casa Aurora                                    1932 Jessie Street                                    Bakersfield, CA 93305Stockton:                      (209) 642-8488                                     Westcare                                    1609 N.

  3) Community Prisoner Mother Program (CPMP)
</p>

<p>
  Summary: Residential program in Pomona for mothers with up to two children under the age of six who were convicted of non-serious, nonviolent offenses.

</p>

<p>
  CPMP is a voluntary program. A CPMP Coordinator facilitates the application procedure at each of the women’s prisons, and should provide you with an application form, which you must fill out and submit to CDCR staff. The CDCR staff then determines eligibility by looking at the nature of your crime, whether you have a history of violence, and your physical, mental, and dental health. According to a 2010 investigation by Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, this process takes anywhere from a few months to over a year

<p>
  Am I eligible for the Alternative Custody Program (ACP)?
</p>

<p>
   In order to qualify for the program, you must have 45 days to two years left in your sentence at the time of placement in the program. CDCR staff has the discretion to accept or deny applicants as it sees fit. Certain people are automatically ineligible for the ACP. If you meet any of the following criteria, you will not be considered for the program:
</p>

<p>
  You were convicted of a violent felony as defined in Penal Code section 667.5(c) (includes homicide, certain sex crimes, and any robbery).You were convicted of a serious felony as defined in Penal Code section 1192.7. (includes homicide, certain sex crimes, kidnapping, and certain assault crimes)You are listed on the sex offender registry pursuant to Penal Code section 290 or have been convicted of a sexually violent offense as defined in Health and Safety Code section 6600.You have a Static Risk Assessment score of five or higher, which means the CDCR has predicted you are likely to commit a violent offense upon release.

In general, this includes acts that are especially violent (murder, battery, assault), dangerous (arson, damage to valuable property), or dishonest (bribery, forgery of important records, attempts to escape). Notably, while it would typically be considered a class B or C offense, possession of alcohol/drugs may not necessarily disqualify you from the MCRP. You meet other, undefined exclusionary criteria, which potentially includes a current medical or psychiatric diagnosis, a history of perpetrating child abuse, and the inability to find an appropriate placement site. In such cases, CDCR staff will decide to exclude on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>

<p>
  How do I apply for the ACP? 
</p>

<p>
  First, you need to obtain an acceptance letter from an existing transitional housing facility. Once you have received this letter, you may ask your counselor for an ACP application. When you fill out this application, list the facility that has accepted you as your chosen site. The CDCR must approve of the site. 
</p>

<p>
  Once you are determined to be eligible for the ACP, a CDCR staff member will respond within two weeks to notify you that your eligibility has been approved. Staff will then help you develop an individualized treatment and rehabilitation plan, to be used if you are accepted into the program.  
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, you will receive a written notice explaining whether your application was accepted or denied. If your application is accepted, you will be released no later than seven business days after receiving written notice. If there are no free beds at your requested facility, you will be released the first day a bed becomes available. 
</p>

<p>
  If your application is denied, the written notice will explain the reasons for denial. You may appeal the denial through normal grievance procedures, or can reapply 30 days after receiving written notice.

<p>
  Disabilities & Requesting Reasonable Accommodations on Any Housing Application
</p>

<p>
  AS SOMEONE APPLYING FOR HOUSING (PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED), WHAT DO MY DISABILITIES HAVE TO DO WITH MY CRIMINAL RECORD?
</p>

<p>
  If you can prove that your criminal conviction was the result of a disability—for example, due to mental illness and/or past drug addiction you may be able to get a “reasonable accommodation” when applying for ANY type of housing. However, a PHA, owner, or other housing provider is not required to grant a reasonable accommodation to an individual with a disability if that person would be a “direct threat” to the health, safety or property of others, unless the requested reasonable accommodations can actually eliminate or significantly reduce such a threat. 
</p>

<p>
  Under the law, housing providers cannot treat persons with disabilities exactly the same as other housing applicants or residents if doing so denies people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.[1266] Therefore, by law, a PHA or owner must make reasonable accommodations to its rules, policies, practices, or services when it may be necessary to provide applicants with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space[1267]—even if that accommodation results in a preference for disabled individuals over similar, non-disabled individuals.[1268] 
</p>

<p>
  This rule applies to ALL types of housing—public and private. 
</p>

<p>
  WARNING: Just because you committed a criminal offense as a result of a disability does not mean you automatically have the right to a reasonable accommodation for housing. It can be very difficult to prove that your disability CAUSED your criminal offense, AND that the disability is the type that qualifies you for a reasonable accommodation
</p>

<p>
  IF MY CRIMINAL CONVICTION WAS THE RESULT OF A DISABILITY, WHAT IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION THAT I CAN ASK FOR?
</p>

<p>
  A “reasonable accommodation” is a change, exception, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be necessary to give an applicant with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space.[1269] There is no limit or restriction to the type of accommodation that you can request, as long as the accommodation is reasonable. 
</p>

<p>
  As a general rule, an accommodation will be considered reasonable so long as it does NOT:
</p>

<p>
  Pose an undue financial burden on the PHA or owner, and/or
</p>

<p>
  Require the PHA or owner to fundamentally change its housing program[1270]
</p>

<p>
  It’s recommended that you ask a Public Housing Authority (PHA), owner, or housing provider to look at your criminal record using a different standard, or to make an exception to its criminal history policy altogether. For information on how to ask for a reasonable accommodation from a PHA, owner, or housing provider, see the next page.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS CONSIDERED A DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA? 
</p>

<p>
  California law defines a disability as any physical or mental impairment that limits one or more of your major life activities.[1271] 
</p>

<p>
  > What is a physical disability in California?
</p>

<p>
  A physical impairment is any disease, physical disorder, physical condition, or disfigurement that:
</p>

<p>
  Affects one or more of your body systems (i.e. your heart, your eyes) or functions (i.e. breathing, speaking), and 
</p>

<p>
  Limits a major life activity.[1272]
</p>

<p>
  > What counts as a mental impairment?
</p>

<p>
  A mental impairment is any mental or psychological condition that limits a major life activity. Common examples of mental impairments are:
</p>

<p>
  Intellectual disabilities 
</p>

<p>
  Brain disease 
</p>

<p>
  Emotional or mental illnesses
</p>

<p>
  Learning disabilities
</p>

<p>
  Any other mental or psychological condition that requires special attention or services[1273] 
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS NOT CONSIDERED A DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA?
</p>

<p>
  It is not a protected disability if you are:
</p>

<p>
  Currently engaged in illegal drug use;
</p>

<p>
  Currently abusing alcohol in a way that interferes with others’ health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the property;
</p>

<p>
  People who pose a substantial threat to others, that cannot be controlled by a reasonable accommodation (see below for more information on reasonable accommodations)[1274] 
</p>

<p>
  DOES DRUG ADDICTION QUALIFY AS A DISABILITY?
</p>

<p>
  Technically, yes, if it is PAST drug use and you have permanently stopped using illegal drugs, it does qualify as a disability under both federal and state law. BUT If you are currently using illegal drugs, then you are not considered disabled.[1275] See the next question for what is considered a disability in California.
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT! There are no reported California cases where a rehabilitated applicant with a history of substance abuse, or an applicant with mental impairment, and a history of criminal acts arising from the substance abuse or mental illness has been granted a reasonable accommodation from a PHA’s criminal activity restrictions. Courts have generally been unreceptive to these arguments.Specifically, courts have been hesitant to accept arguments that a housing applicant’s criminal convictions were the result of mental illness and/or past substance abuse. Again, since it may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction, it is important that you offer as much evidence as possible. 
</p>

<p>
  REMEMBER: 
</p>

<p>
  It may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction. It is important that you submit as much evidence as possible!
</p>

<p>
  HOW can I PROVE MY PAST DRUG USE QUALIFIES AS A DISABILITY?
</p>

<p>
  Under this rule, it can be tricky to prove that you are not a current illegal drug user, especially if there was drug use or convictions for drug use in your recent past. The law doesn’t clearly define what counts as “current” illegal drug use, and there are no reported California court decisions defining “current” illegal drug use.[1276] Some courts outside of California have said a person is NOT a current illegal drug user if that person has permanently stopped using illegal drugs for periods of time ranging from a few months to a year.[1277] Outside of California, courts have said that someone is still a “current” user if they have stopped using for only a few weeks.[1278]
</p>

<p>
  EXAMPLES OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDE:
</p>

<p>
  An exception (“a waiver”) to a PHA, owner, or housing provider’s policy that bars housing to applicants with criminal records, if your criminal conviction was caused by your disability;An owner or housing provider agreeing to admit a tenant with a mental illness that causes the tenant to sometimes become loud or confrontational, so long as the tenant agrees to seek treatment for his or her mental illness;An owner or housing provider allowing a tenant suffering from mental illness to have a live-in aid; orA PHA, owner, or housing provider accepting a reference from an applicant’s social worker or service provider if an applicant has no recent rental history.
</p>

<p>
  Based on the different ways courts are treating this issue, we recommend that you provide evidence that you are not a current user by showing any proof that:
</p>

<p>
  You have successfully completed a supervised substance abuse/drug rehabilitation program;
</p>

<p>
  You are not currently using illegal drugs (meaning any proof that you have permanently stopped using illegal drugs); and/or
</p>

<p>
  You are currently participating in a supervised substance abuse/drug rehabilitation, treatment, or self-help program[1279]
</p>

<p>
  IF I CAN SHOW THAT I’M DISABLED, HOW can I REQUEST A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AS I APPLY FOR HOUSING?
</p>

<p>
  Send a letter to the PHA/housing provider/owner/landlord (whomever is making the decision) requesting a reasonable accommodation. You should SEND A WRITTEN LETTER with a request that clearly explains ALL of the following:
</p>

<p>
  That you have a disability, and what that disability is.
</p>

<p>
  That the disability caused the offense. Attach any documentation you have, like:
</p>

<p>
  Letters from service providers showing that you experienced a mental illness and/or a drug addiction at the time of the offense;
</p>

<p>
  It’s even better if you can have a doctor submit a letter confirming the existence of your disability[1280]
</p>

<p>
  If it is addiction, explain that you no longer suffer from addiction. Attach any documentation you have, like: 
</p>

<p>
  Letters from service providers showing successful completion of a rehabilitation program or effective or ongoing treatment for your addiction;
</p>

<p>
  Letters from service providers that show you are no longer using substances.
</p>

<p>
  What your requested accommodation is, clearly stated:
</p>

<p>
  Ask for what you want directly!! You could ask a PHA, owner, or housing provider to look at your criminal record using a different standard, or to make an exception to its criminal history policy altogether.
</p>

<p>
  Why the accommodation you are requesting is NECESSARY and REASONABLE.
</p>

<p>
  Here, you should say that an exception from criminal history policy is NECESSARY to give you an equal opportunity to access the housing.
</p>

<p>
  Explain how your criminal conduct was the result of the disability —showing the relationship (also called a “nexus”) between your disability and your requested accommodation.[1281]
</p>

<p>
  It is helpful and more persuasive if you have a doctor or service provider submit a letter explaining why your disability requires a reasonable accommodation.
</p>

<p>
  You must also show that the requested accommodation is REASONABLE. A requested accommodation may be found reasonable if:
</p>

<p>
  It’s necessary for you to have an equal opportunity to enjoy the living space.
</p>

<p>
  It’s not too expensive for the landlord.
</p>

<p>
  The administrative burden is not too great.
</p>

<p>
  It doesn’t fundamentally change the PHA’s, housing provider’s, or owner/landlord’s operations.
</p>

<p>
  A landlord or PHA accommodation that gives you “preference” over similar non-disabled people may be reasonable under the circumstances.[1282]
</p>

<p>
  THE DIRECT THREAT EXCEPTION:
</p>

<p>
  Remember that the law does not require that reasonable accommodations be granted to an individual with a disability if that person would be a “direct threat” to the health or safety of other individuals or if that person’s residency would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others UNLESS the reasonable accommodations requested can actually eliminate or significantly reduce such a threat.[1283] This is known as the “direct threat” exception. 
</p>

<p>
  There are some protections for you if a PHA, housing provider, or landlord/owner is arguing that you would be a direct threat to other tenants or property:
</p>

<p>
  First, a PHA or owner MUST PERFORM an individualized assessment of you.
</p>

<p>
  Second, if a reasonable accommodation can significantly reduce the “direct threat” posed by a recognized disability, then the PHA, housing provider, or landlord/owner must make it.
</p>

<p>
  Third, if the PHA, housing provider, or landlord/owner finds that you pose a direct threat to other tenants or property, this should be based only on actual examples of you causing harm or other factual, objective evidence—not their own fears or assumptions about what could happen.
</p>

<p>
  Fourth, a finding of a direct threat cannot be based on assumptions, stereotypes, or fears about mental illness, drug addiction, or other disabilities.[1284]
</p>

<p>
  ONCE I have SENT MY REQUEST FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION, what happens?
</p>

<p>
  There are several phases of a reasonable accommodation request:[1285]
</p>

<p>
  Initial request (see PG. 483). This is when you first send your letter informing the PHA, owner, or housing provider that you have a disability and are requesting a reasonable accommodation[1286] 
</p>

<p>
  Verification: Once you make your initial request for a reasonable accommodation, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will want to verify that you are indeed disabled.
</p>

<p>
  If your disability is obvious or known, and the need for a reasonable accommodation is known, then the housing provider should not ask you for any more information 
</p>

<p>
  If your disability is known and obvious, but your need for the accommodation is not well-known or obvious, then the housing provider should ask only for information necessary to verify the need for a reasonable accommodation—for example, notes explaining your need from a doctor or clinician. 
</p>

<p>
  If neither your disability nor the need for your accommodation is known nor obvious, the housing provider may ask for verification of both your disability and your need for a reasonable accommodation.[1287] 
</p>

<p>
  The Decision. After reviewing your request, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will decide whether or not to grant your reasonable accommodation request. 
</p>

<p>
  The “Interactive” process:
</p>

<p>
  If the PHA, owner, or housing provider refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you should try to engage them in an informal “interactive process” in which you discuss alternative solutions that might meet both of your needs. HUD guidelines encourage you to try this informal route first, before starting the formal grievance procedure, because it is more flexible and often leads to quicker resolutions.[1288] 
</p>

<p>
  If, after engaging in the “interactive process,” the PHA, owner, or housing provider still refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you may have to file a formal Fair Housing complaint with HUD or the DFEH.[1289] 
</p>

<p>
  HOW can I CHALLENGE MY DENIAL FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION?
</p>

<p>
  OPTION 1: YOU CAN FILE A COMPLAINT.
</p>

<p>
  If you believe that a PHA, owner, or housing provider denied your request for a reasonable accommodation due to your disability and/or your past drug use, you may file a complaint with HUD (federal housing protection agency) or with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency).[1290] 
</p>

<p>
  After you file a complaint, if HUD or DFEH determines that you were discriminated against (meaning it finds that your complaint has “merit”) then HUD or DFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the PHA, owner, or housing provider on your behalf. Go to Appendix H on PG. 493 to learn how to file a complaint with HUD or DFEH.
</p>

<p>
  OPTION 2: YOU CAN TRY TO SUE IN COURT. 
</p>

<p>
  To sue a housing provider under the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA), California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act),[1291] you must show that your status as an individual with a disability or drug history was a motivating factor in the owner’s or PHA’s decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.[1292] You must also provide sufficient evidence that the requested accommodation is reasonable, and that you are a former/ recovering substance user (and not a current substance user), or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.[1293]
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS THE PHA, OWNER, or landlord LIKELY TO ARGUE TO DEFEND its decision to DENy my REASONABLE ACCOMDATION?
</p>

<p>
  The PHA or owner will likely argue that you do not have a protected disability.
</p>

<p>
  They might argue that, you are a “current user” of illegal drugs or substances, and therefore, you are not disabled under the law, OR that you have not sought adequate treatment for your mental illness, and therefore are not disabled under the law.[1294] 
</p>

<p>
  If you go to court, you can attempt to disprove these arguments by providing treatment records establishing that you have not used illegal substances for the relevant period of time, or that you receive treatment for your mental illness.[1295] Your argument will be even stronger if you can provide evidence of your participation in or completion of a drug/substance abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness. Go to PG. 408 to learn more about challenging a denial from federal government-assisted housing, or go to PG. 445 to learn more about challenging a denial from private housing.

<p>
  Housing Owners’/ Landlords’ Access to Credit Reports
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS A CREDIT REPORT?
</p>

<p>
  Your credit report includes information about creditworthiness, such as your record of paying bills on time. A credit report will show information dating back 7 years (or 10 years in the case of a bankruptcy), including the following
</p>

<p>
  history of paying bills and loans on time or record of late payments;
</p>

<p>
  open accounts and level of indebtedness;
</p>

<p>
  collection actions;
</p>

<p>
  bankruptcies or tax liens; and
</p>

<p>
  civil court judgments, including housing-related court actions filed by a previous landlord that may or may not have led to a past eviction.
</p>

<p>
  HOWEVER, a credit report does NOT include criminal history information like a tenant report would. 
</p>

<p>
  HELPFUL HINT: 
</p>

<p>
  If you are looking for a rental, it is best to check your credit reports before the PHA or owner does—so you know what they will find. You can go online and order FREE credit reports from the three national credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. If there’s an error, it’s a good idea to file a dispute with the bureau rather than try to explain it at the last minute.
</p>

<p>
  WHO CAN ACCESS MY CREDIT REPORT?
</p>

<p>
  Anyone who is evaluating your ability to pay for housing can order your credit report in California. That means that private owners, PHAs, AND owners of government-assisted housing can order a credit report to see if you have good credit and will be a reliable tenant. 
</p>

<p>
  DOES MY CONSISTENTLY PAYING RENT ON TIME IN THE PAST HELP MY CREDIT STANDING?
</p>

<p>
  Maybe, but most likely not. The companies that collect information about your credit standing are only just beginning to collect this information in a systematized way. 
</p>

<p>
  A credit report will show whether or not you’ve ever been evicted, your ability to pay credit card bills, utility bills, and other bills on time, and any success you’ve had paying back loans.[1296]
</p>

<p>
  CAN SOMEONE FIND OUT ABOUT PAST LATE PAYMENTS ON RENT FROM A CREDIT REPORT?
</p>

<p>
  Maybe. Generally, late rent payments are not a part of your credit history unless the landlord or management company is reporting them. If the matter was referred to a collection agency or a civil court (like eviction case started against you), it is possible it would show up on your credit report.

<p>
  San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE? 
</p>

<p>
  The San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance is a new law that offers special protections for people with criminal records who apply to certain types of affordable housing in San Francisco.[1297] (If you are interested in the parts of this new law that apply to employment, go the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, Appendix G, on PG. 780.)
</p>

<p>
  LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ONLINE?
</p>

<p>
  Check out the San Francisco Human Rights Commission’s website about how the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance applies to affordable housing providers: http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdf. 
</p>

<p>
  WHAT KINDS OF HOUSING DOES THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE PROTECT?
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT DEFINITION: 
</p>

<p>
  Under the San Francisco Fair Chance ordinance, “affordable housing” is defined as “any residential building in the City that has received funding from the City, connected in whole or in part to restricting rents, the funding being provided either directly or indirectly through funding to another entity that owns, master leases, or develops the building. Affordable Housing also includes ‘affordable units’ in the City as that term is defined in Article 4 of the Planning Code.” The term “housing provider” is broad, and includes any entity that owns, master leases, or develops affordable housing, and any agent, such as a property management company, that makes tenancy decisions on behalf if these entities.
</p>

<p>
  It protects applicants and tenants in city-funded affordable housing in San Francisco, CA. It does NOT apply to federally subsidized housing (unless the property is receiving multiple subsidies including city-funded subsidies to keep it affordable).
</p>

<p>
  DOES THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE APPLY TO federal government-assisted HOUSING?
</p>

<p>
  No. These new legal protections apply only to city government-funded affordable housing in San Francisco, CA.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS DOES THIS LAW GIVE ME IF I’M APPLYING TO CITY-FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD?
</p>

<p>
  We break down all the rights it gives you in each step in your affordable housing application process:
</p>

<p>
  STEP 1: YOUR RIGHTS WHEN APPLYING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO
</p>

<p>
  When you are APPLYING, Affordable housing providers in San Francisco:
</p>

<p>
  MUST NOT have a question about past convictions on the initial application. Before an affordable housing provider asks about your convictions or looks at a background check report on you, it must:[1298]
</p>

<p>
  Determine that you are (1) legally eligible to rent the housing unit and (2) qualified to rent the housing unit under the affordable housing provider’s criteria for evaluating rental history and credit history;
</p>

<p>
  Provide notice about the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance;[1299] and
</p>

<p>
  Provide notice about state and federal laws about background checks.[1300]
</p>

<p>
  MUST NOT have blanket bans like “No Felons Apply.”
</p>

<p>
  In ads, they MUST state that they will consider qualified applicants with criminal histories.
</p>

<p>
  They MUST have a notice posted about the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance.[1301] Here is an electronic copy of the notice that affordable housing providers must post: http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdfn. You can also see a copy on APPENDIX G, PG. 489.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 2: YOUR RIGHTS WHEN ASKED ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND
</p>

<p>
  What can city-funded affordable housing providers in San Francisco ask me about my criminal record after they find I am qualified for the housing in every other way?
</p>

<p>
  After you’re found qualified, an affordable housing provider in San Francisco can ask about:
</p>

<p>
  Pending (open) arrests, and
</p>

<p>
  Convictions that are 0–7 years old (based on the date of sentencing).[1302] 
</p>

<p>
  BUT even though they can ask about this information, there are limits on how the affordable housing provider can use it—see Step 3 below.
</p>

<p>
  What can city-funded affordable housing providers in San Francisco NEVER ask me about my criminal record?
</p>

<p>
  City-funded housing providers in San Francisco can never ask about:
</p>

<p>
  Arrests that didn’t lead to a conviction;
</p>

<p>
  Diversion or deferral programs;
</p>

<p>
  Dismissed convictions (which means any conviction that has been dismissed, expunged, voided, invalidated, or made inoperative by the Court);
</p>

<p>
  Juvenile convictions;
</p>

<p>
  Convictions older than 7 years (based on the date of sentencing);
</p>

<p>
  Infractions (meaning anything that is not a misdemeanor or felony).
</p>

<p>
  Affordable housing providers cannot ask about these 6 types of cases and can never use them against you at any stage!
</p>

<p>
  STEP 3: YOUR RIGHTS WHEN BEING CONSIDERED 
</p>

<p>
  An affordable housing provider in San Francisco that is considering your conviction history must:
</p>

<p>
  Conduct an individualized assessment—meaning look at all of the circumstances of the person applying to housing and information available about their criminal record, including mitigating circumstances;
</p>

<p>
  Consider only “directly-related” convictions — which means that the underlying conduct “has a direct and specific negative bearing on the safety of persons or property, given the nature of the housing;”[1303]
</p>

<p>
  Consider the time that has passed since your conviction(s); and
</p>

<p>
  Consider any evidence of rehabilitation or mitigating information you share, such as:
</p>

<p>
  Completion of parole or probation;
</p>

<p>
  Letters of recommendation from employers or others;
</p>

<p>
  Education or training you’ve received;
</p>

<p>
  Participation in an alcohol/drug treatment program;
</p>

<p>
  IF YOU ARE DENIED, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPOND!!
</p>

<p>
  You have only 14 days to respond. SO ACT FAST! You can respond IN WRITING or VERBALLY by: 
</p>

<p>
  Pointing out any inaccuracies in the background check report, ANDProviding evidence of your rehabilitation or mitigating information. See the list of examples of evidence of your rehabilitation or mitigating information under Step 3 above.
</p>

<p>
  Completion of rehabilitation programs; and
</p>

<p>
  Any additional context for the conviction—including your age when you were convicted, or mitigating factors like physical or emotional abuse, coercion, untreated abuse/mental illness that led to the conviction.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 4: YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DENIED SF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD
</p>

<p>
  If an affordable housing provider in SF wants to deny you because of your record, THEY MUST abide by the following rules:
</p>

<p>
  They cannot deny you because of a conviction more than 7 years old (based on the date of sentencing) 
</p>

<p>
  They cannot deny you because of arrests that never led to convictions; 
</p>

<p>
  They must provide you a copy of your background report;
</p>

<p>
  They must tell you why you were denied—what the issue was in your conviction history; and
</p>

<p>
  Give you 14 days to provide information about your rehabilitation or any errors in the background check report.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 5: YOUR RIGHT TO A FINAL DECISION AFTER YOU RESPOND & ANOTHER LEVEL OF APPEAL
</p>

<p>
  This could be when... An Clear violations include when an affordable housing provider in SF:
</p>

<p>
  Asks about your criminal record on an initial housing application;Has a blanket ban like “We don’t accept felons,” or didn’t consider your criminal record on a case-by-case basis;Didn’t give you notice of your rights;Denied you because of a conviction that was older than 7 years.
</p>

<p>
  Must I get notice of the housing provider’s final decision?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. An affordable housing provider in SF who makes a final decision to deny you must give you a final notice. If a final negative decision is made based on your criminal record, you should consider challenging the decision to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. HOW? See STEP 6 below.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 6: REPORT CLEAR VIOLATIONS* TO THE SAN FRANCISCO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WITHIN 60 DAYS
</p>

<p>
  If you believe that there has been a violation of the rules above, you should report it to the SF Human Rights Commission. This must be done within 60 days of the violation (when you get your final decision).[1304] 
</p>

<p>
  You can begin the process of reporting a violation by following these 3 steps:
</p>

<p>
  STEP 1: Fill out a complaint form online here: http://hrc.sfintranet.firmstep.com/achieveforms-node/discrimination-public-form, and submit. Give as many details about the discrimination as possible! You can submit the complaint form online, by mail, or in person.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 2: Call (415) 252-2500 to schedule an intake interview. If you submitted the intake questionnaire online, HRC will contact you to set up an intake interview appointment.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 3: After intake, the HRC will try to mediate between you and the housing provide; investigate the alleged violation; and make a finding about whether or not the housing provider broke the law. The HRC’s process for responding to these complaints looks like this:
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: HRC's Discrimination Complaints Investigation and Mediation Division investigates and mediates complaints of discrimination and non-compliance in employment, housing, and public accommodation.[1305] 
</p>

<p>
  REMEMBER—YOU ARE AN AGENT OF CHANGE! 
</p>

<p>
  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE TO THE SAN FRANCISCO HRC? 
</p>

<p>
  It’s important to report violations because:
</p>

<p>
  You are helping to enforce this important law that adds protection for people with criminal records applying for affordable housing in San Francisco;
</p>

<p>
  Helping others in your community;
</p>

<p>
  The Human Rights Commission (HRC) can find out more information than you can;
</p>

<p>
  You could get relief—for example, be admitted into the affordable housing.
</p>

<p>
  The affordable housing provider could be penalized by the city—and hopefully wont do it again![1306] 
</p>

<p>
  Appendix I
</p>

<p>
  Filing a Complaint for Illegal Discrimination in Private Housing
</p>

<p>
  If you believe you have been illegally discriminated against in applying for private housing from a private landlord (meaning neither the owner, you nor the property receive federal government money to assist in making the housing more affordable), you can challenge that discriminatory denial. Read about how to challenge an illegal discriminatory denial below, and which government agencies you should contact.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS?
</p>

<p>
  FEDERAL HOUSING AGENCY:
</p>

<p>
  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a federal agency that enforces the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA).[1307] HUD has to refer the complaints of housing discrimination it receives to the fair housing enforcement agency in the state where the discrimination occurred if that state’s fair housing agency is certified by HUD as having mostly the same laws, procedures, remedies, and judicial review.[1308] 
</p>

<p>
  AND
</p>

<p>
  STATE HOUSING AGENCY:
</p>

<p>
  In California, our state fair housing enforcement agency is the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), and it is certified by HUD to enforce, investigate, conciliate, and litigate discriminatory housing practices in California.
</p>

<p>
  I BELIEVE A PRIVATE LANDLORD ILLEGALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ME DUE TO MY CRIMINAL RECORD. WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?
</p>

<p>
  Your 3 main options are: 
</p>

<p>
  You could file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency);
</p>

<p>
  You could file an administrative complaint with HUD (the federal housing protection agency);
</p>

<p>
  You could file a civil lawsuit in state or federal court;
</p>

<p>
  OR 
</p>

<p>
  You could allow HUD (the federal housing agency) or California’s DFEH (the state housing agency) to file a lawsuit on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
  > HOW CAN I FIGURE OUT WHICH OPTION TO CHOOSE? 
</p>

<p>
  Talk to a lawyer or an advocate at a nonprofit legal services organization if possible—they can help advise you! Also, you can always file a complaint with both HUD & DFEH. More on each of these 3 options below.
</p>

<p>
  You can file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH or the federal agency HUD, or both. This may lead to a lawsuit in civil court (possible with both DFEH or HUD) or an administrative hearing (HUD only). Read about how to file a state administrative complaint and a federal administrative complaint below.
</p>

<p>
  OPTION 1: 
</p>

<p>
  FILING A STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT WITH CALIFORNIA’S DFEH.[1309]
</p>

<p>
  You can file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH within 1 year of the discriminatory act.[1310] To begin the process, you must contact DFEH in writing, online, or by phone, with basic information about the discrimination (what happened to you, when, where, etc.).[1311] The DFEH will conduct an intake interview to learn more about your situation, and to determine whether you can file a formal (“verified”) complaint.[1312] See PG. 494 for a step-by-step explanation of the DFEH’s state complaint process.
</p>

<p>
  Under what circumstances will California’s DFEH accept my complaint?
</p>

<p>
  DFEH is supposed to be very generous in accepting your complaint. However, in some cases, the DFEH may decide that you cannot file a complaint—for example, if the landlord’s conduct is legal, happened more than a year ago, or is outside of DFEH’s legal control, or if you already filed a complaint with DFEH or HUD regarding the same discrimination.[1313]
</p>

<p>
  How much time does the DFEH have to respond and investigate?
</p>

<p>
  Once the DFEH accepts your complaint, it must follow certain time limits. The DFEH has 10 days to inform you of your procedural rights and obligations.[1314] The landlord then has 20 days to respond to the complaint.[1315] Within 30 days, DFEH must begin to investigate your complaint, and it must finish the investigation within 100 days.[1316] 
</p>

<p>
  Will I have to do anything else while I wait for a response from the DFEH?
</p>

<p>
  Maybe. At some point (before, during, or after the investigation), the DFEH may also require you and the landlord to go through mediation (meaning an alternative dispute resolution or a settlement negotiation) to see whether you can resolve the problem cooperatively.[1317] 
</p>

<p>
  HERE IS A STEP-BY-STEP OVERVIEW OF THE FEHA HOUSING COMPLAINT PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA:[1318]
</p>

<p>
  File a Pre-Complaint Questionnaire.
</p>

<p>
  First, you need to file a Pre-Complaint Questionnaire, Form DFEH-700-01 (English) or Form DFEH-700-01S (Spanish). A Pre-Complaint Questionnaire can be filed by you, the Director of DFEH, or a community organization. You can do this online, by phone, or by mail. 
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: It’s important that you provide an up-to-date phone number where you can be reached!
</p>

<p>
  Online: Go to http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/, create an account, log in, and fill out the Pre-Complaint Questionnaire. Alternatively, you can email your Pre-Complaint Questionnaire to contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov.
</p>

<p>
  By Phone: Call the DFEH’s Communication Center at (800) 884-1684. If you have a hearing impairment, please call 800-884-1684 or TTY at (800) 700-2320 for service.
</p>

<p>
  By mail: Request a printed copy of the form through the DFEH website (http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/contact.htm). After you carefully fill out the questionnaire, you can send it to the DFEH office nearest you (see the list below for office locations):
</p>

<p>
  DFEH—Elk Grove Office2218 Kausen Drive, S. 100Elk Grove, CA 95758DFEH—Bay Area Regional Office39141 Civic Center Drive, S. 250Fremont, CA 94538DFEH—Fresno Office1277 E. Alluvial Avenue, S. 101Fresno, CA 93720DFEH—Bakersfield Office4800 Stockdale Highway, S. 215Bakersfield, CA 93309DFEH—Los Angeles Office320 West 4th St., 10th FloorLos Angeles, CA 90013
</p>

<p>
  Intake.
</p>

<p>
  Within 10 days of receiving your Pre-Complaint Questionnaire, an investigator from the DFEH will contact you by telephone to conduct an intake interview. The investigator will ask you questions to collect facts about the possible discrimination.
</p>

<p>
  File the Formal Complaint.
</p>

<p>
  If your complaint is accepted for investigation, the DFEH investigator will draft the complaint and ask for you or your representative to sign the complaint. This formal complaint is then served on the “Respondent” (the person or entity that who you have made the allegation against). The Respondent is required to answer the complaint and is given the opportunity to voluntarily resolve it. A no-fault resolution can be negotiated at any time during the complaint process.
</p>

<p>
  If there is also federal law that would protect you, then the formal complaint is also filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Note: HUD usually accepts DFEH’s findings with respect to the alleged discrimination.
</p>

<p>
  Investigation Period.
</p>

<p>
  DFEH must investigate every case in a standard, timely manner.
</p>

<p>
  DFEH has the authority to take depositions, issue subpoenas and interrogatories and seek Temporary Restraining Orders when appropriate.
</p>

<p>
  If the investigative findings do not show a violation of the law, the DFEH will close the case. If the DFEH finds a violation, continue to STEP 5.
</p>

<p>
  Mediation (a.k.a. “Conciliation”)
</p>

<p>
  If the DFEH’s investigation shows that there was a violation of fair housing law, then it will schedule formal mediation/ conciliation conferences between the DFEH’s representatives, you, and the responding landlord.
</p>

<p>
  During the mediation/conciliation conference, the DFEH presents information supporting its belief that there has been a violation and explores options to resolve the complaint.
</p>

<p>
  If formal mediation/conciliation fails, the DFEH will then have to decide whether or not to file a civil lawsuit.
</p>

<p>
  Possible Outcome #1: If the DFEH determines that you have been discriminated against (that your complaint has “merit”), and that the discrimination cannot be resolved through mediation, the DEFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the landlord on your behalf. (Continue to STEP 6 below).
</p>

<p>
  Possible Outcome #2: If the DFEH decides not to file a lawsuit (or takes longer than 100 days to file the lawsuit), the DFEH must give you a written notice with the following information: (1) DFEH’s decision regarding your complaint, (2) the reasons for the DFEH’s decision; (3) your right to sue the landlord directly in court (see PG. 498 below on how to file a civil lawsuit in court); and (3) a list resources for filing a civil lawsuit.[1319]
</p>

<p>
  Litigation
</p>

<p>
  If the DFEH decides to litigate the case, it will be heard in civil court. 
</p>

<p>
  Court Remedies & Possible Outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  If the lawsuit is successful (meaning the court finds that the landlord discriminated against you), you may be awarded some or all of the following remedies: 
</p>

<p>
  actual money damages (to compensate you for your losses); 
</p>

<p>
  punitive damages (to punish the landlord for committing illegal discrimination); 
</p>

<p>
  injunctive relief (ordering the landlord to stop discriminating or take some other action, such as changing its screening procedures or providing you with housing); AND/OR 
</p>

<p>
  attorneys fees and costs (to reimburse the DFEH or a private attorney for the costs of the lawsuit).[1320]
</p>

<p>
  Below is a flowchart showing what happens when you file a DFEH complaint.[1321] Remember: if HUD (the federal fair housing agency, see PG. 497) also has jurisdiction (legal authority) over your housing complaint, then the DFEH will also file your complaint with HUD at the same time.
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  OPTION 2: 
</p>

<p>
  FILING A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT WITH HUD.
</p>

<p>
  The procedures and potential relief of filing an administrative complaint with HUD are basically the same as filing an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (see PG. 494 on how to file state housing discrimination complaint with the DFEH). 
</p>

<p>
  How much time do I have to file a complaint after the discriminatory act occurs?
</p>

<p>
  You have 1 year after the discriminatory practice occurs to file your complaint with HUD.[1322]
</p>

<p>
  How long does HUD have to respond and investigate?
</p>

<p>
  HUD has 100 days to determine if there is “reasonable cause” to believe the discrimination occurred.[1323] Within these 100 days, HUD must try to facilitate a conciliation agreement (meaning an agreement that solves the problem) between you and the landlord who discriminated.[1324]
</p>

<p>
  Will HUD ever give special treatment to my housing discrimination complaint over other ones? 
</p>

<p>
  * HUD gives special treatment in 2 types of cases:
</p>

<p>
  Special Case #1: If HUD decides that a court must act quickly, it can refer your case to the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), which must then file a civil enforcement action for temporary or permanent injunctive relief pending a final disposition on the case.[1325] This civil action doesn’t stop the administrative proceedings; it just tries to create a solution more quickly when it’s deemed necessary.Special Case #2: If your complaint has to do with the legality or illegality of any zoning or other land use law, then HUD must refer it to the U.S. DOJ for civil prosecution.[1326] HUD must then file either a charge against the respondent, or dismiss the complaint.[1327]
</p>

<p>
  OPTION 3: YOU CAN FILE A CIVIL LAWSUIT DIRECTLY IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT—DEPENDING ON WHAT KINDS OF LEGAL VIOLATIONS YOU ARE ALLEGING.
</p>

<p>
  You may file a civil state or federal lawsuit under either or both federal law (e.g., the FHA) and state law (e.g., the FEHA, the Unruh Act, or other laws). 
</p>

<p>
  Under federal Law: FHA and FEHA, you must file your lawsuit within 2 years of the discriminatory act itself OR within 2 years of the landlord violating a mediation/conciliation agreement that HUD or DFEH had facilitated for you (refer back to STEP 5 on PG. 496 above).[1328] 
</p>

<p>
  Under state law: California’s Unruh Act, there is not a clear deadline by when you must file the lawsuit, but it could be as short of a timeline as 1 year![1329] If you are able to do so, talk to an attorney about your options and timelines as soon as possible after the discrimination occurs (see a list of housing legal aid providers across California on PG. 1286). 
</p>

<p>
  What remedies are available to me in a state or federal lawsuit?
</p>

<p>
  If the lawsuit is successful (meaning the judge finds that the landlord discriminated against you), you may be awarded some or all of the following remedies: 
</p>

<p>
  actual money damages (to compensate you for your losses); 
</p>

<p>
  punitive damages (to punish the landlord for committing illegal discrimination); 
</p>

<p>
  injunctive relief (ordering the landlord to stop discriminating or take some other action, such as changing its screening procedures or providing you with housing); AND/OR 
</p>

<p>
  attorney’s fees and costs (to reimburse the DFEH or a private attorney for the costs of the lawsuit).[1330]
</p>

<p>
  OPTION #4: 
</p>

<p>
  The U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ) or the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ) may also file a complaint—on the behalf of their government agencies OR on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
  The U.S. DOJ may file a civil lawsuit in federal court if there is reasonable cause to believe that:
</p>

<p>
  any person or group is engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful acts, 
</p>

<p>
  or (2) the denial of federal or state housing rights is an issue of “general public importance.”[1331] 
</p>

<p>
  The California Attorney General, who leads the CA DOJ, may also file a civil lawsuit in state court under the same standard.[1332] In such a case, the California Attorney General and the DFEH (California Department of Fair Employment and Housing) must comply with the California State Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct in representing your interests, establish an attorney-client relationship, and zealously represent your interests.[1333]
</p>

<p>
  This type of lawsuit is called a “state enforcement action,” and the U.S. DOJ or CA DOJ must file the lawsuit within 18 months (1.5 years) after the discriminatory act.[1334]
</p>

<p>
  DOES MY CITY HAVE ADDITIONAL LOCAL PROTECTIONS? 
</p>

<p>
  It may! If your city or county has special protections against housing discrimination of people with records, or has local agencies in charge of enforcing fair housing laws, then you may also want to bring your housing discrimination complaint to the city agency responsible for fair housing where you live. If you aren’t sure, you can always ask someone at the DFEH, or ask a local nonprofit housing attorney (see a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to assist you on PG. 1286). For example, the city of San Francisco, CA has a new law called the “Fair Chance Ordinance” that adds additional protections for people with criminal records who apply to live in city-funded affordable housing (which includes Below Market Rate or “BMR” units in private buildings in SF). Go to Appendix H, PG. 493 for information on the San Francisco law and the process of filing a complaint against a landlord or housing provider who has violated the law in San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
   APPENDIX J
</p>

<p>
  Rural development (RD) grievance procedures 
</p>

<p>
  The grievance procedures for Rural Development (RD) housing are different from most other government-assisted housing programs. Here is an overview of how it works if you live in RD housing:
</p>

<p>
  When a grievance is filed, regulations require the owner of the multifamily property (or owner’s representative) to offer to meet informally with the denied applicant within 10 calendar days to resolve the grievance. 
</p>

<p>
  If the informal meeting fails to resolve the issue, the owner must file a report summarizing the problem to USDA (DEFINE THIS) and the applicant.
</p>

<p>
  The applicant (you) may submit a summary of the problem to USDA. 
</p>

<p>
  After you get a summary of the problem, you must file a written request for an informal review hearing within 10 calendar days.
</p>

<p>
  After you request the informal review hearing, a hearing panel will be selected.
</p>

<p>
  You and the owner of the multifamily property may agree on a hearing officer, or you may each appoint one member of a 3-person panel, and those two hearing officers choose the third officer. If you and the owner cannot agree within 30 days on the two hearing officers, USDA will give you notice and appoint a person to act as the sole hearing officer.
</p>

<p>
  A USDA-approved ‘Standing Hearing Panel’ can also hear all grievances related to a particular development, where at least one member of the standing hearing panel must be selected by the residents at a formal resident meeting called to select hearing panel members.
</p>

<p>
  After the hearing panel is selected, the hearing will be scheduled within 15 days.
</p>

<p>
  APPENDIX K
</p>

<p>
  Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)
</p>

<p>
  It is very common to live in a transitional housing program after release from prison or jail. As described on PG. 382, transitional housing programs are temporary programs that offer temporary housing and services. They usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. Some transitional housing programs offer services like job training, counseling, GED programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are intended for people with specific needs such as mental illness, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 392), disabilities (PG. 480), or domestic violence support (see PG. 387).
</p>

<p>
  In this section, we explain a special law called the Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA). Just because you live in transitional housing does NOT mean that the THPMA applies to you, so read carefully!
</p>

<p>
  HOW CAN A transitional HOUSING PROVIDER REMOVE ME FROM MY HOUSING?
</p>

<p>
  AS A GENERAL RULE: 
</p>

<p>
  If a resident and a transitional housing provider have an agreement for that person to live in the housing unit, the transitional housing provider MUST follow California’s formal eviction process in civil court (these cases are called “unlawful detainer” actions under the law). If a transitional housing provider removes you without going through the formal court process, that housing provider could be subject to legal liability. If possible, talk to an lawyer or advocate at a legal aid organization about your rights (see a list of legal aid organizations across California, beginning on PG. 1286).
</p>

<p>
  EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE—THE THPMA:
</p>

<p>
  The THPMA is a California state law and says owners of transitional housing can evict you more quickly than a normal eviction procedure ONLY IF the following 3 requirements are met:
</p>

<p>
  You committed “participant misconduct or abuse”; 	
</p>

<p>
  You have lived in the transitional housing program for less than 6 months; AND
</p>

<p>
  You signed a WRITTEN CONTRACT with the transitional housing provider when entering the program that explicitly stated that the THPMA applied, with information about your rights and the procedure for using the THPMA to kick someone out more quickly.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS A “TENANT”?
</p>

<p>
  A tenant is a person who lives on land or in a property that is rented from a landlord.
</p>

<p>
  ALL of these factors need to be true, and most of the time, they are not, so REMEMBER—generally you have the same rights as a tenant facing eviction, which means usually a transitional housing provider has to go through the court process to evict (remove) you.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS considered A “TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM” UNDER THE THPMA?
</p>

<p>
  Under the THPMA, a transitional housing program is any program designed to assist homeless persons to live independently in permanent housing with all the following components:
</p>

<p>
  Residency requirements from 30 days to 24 months.
</p>

<p>
  Provides comprehensive social service programs incl. individualized case mgt. and may include other services such as alcohol/substance abuse counseling, self-improvement training, employment and training, and living skills.
</p>

<p>
  Provides temporary housing with structured setting and rules participants need to comply with to remain in program.
</p>

<p>
  KEY DEFINITION: “Homeless person” = This law defines a homeless person as an individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate place to sleep at night, or lived in any temporary housing, shelter, or institution, which includes sites not ordinarily used or designed for regular sleeping. This definition also covers any person living with the transitional housing program participant.
</p>

<p>
  WHEN MAY A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS AND EVICT me MORE QUICKLY THAN the normal eviction process?
</p>

<p>
  An operator may use the faster, expedited THPMA restraining order/injunction process only for (1) program misconduct, or (2) abuse, defined below.
</p>

<p>
  Program misconduct—is an intentional violation of the transitional housing program’s rules and regulations. The intentional violation must “substantially interfere with the orderly operation of the program,” and involve one of the following acts:
</p>

<p>
  Drunkenness on site; 
</p>

<p>
  Unlawful use or sale of drugs; 
</p>

<p>
  Theft; 
</p>

<p>
  Arson; 
</p>

<p>
  Destruction of property (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site); or
</p>

<p>
  Violence or threat of violence and harassment (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).
</p>

<p>
  OR
</p>

<p>
  Abuse—is intentionally or recklessly causing, or attempting to cause, bodily injury or sexual assault; or placing someone else in reasonable fear of “imminent serious bodily injury” (against yourself, the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).
</p>

<p>
  Even in these situations, the transitional housing provider may NOT use the expedited THPMA removal process against a participant in the program for 6 months or more, UNLESS a restraining order (permanent injunction) or temporary restraining order (TRO) is already pending or in force against you. If the operator hasn’t started a THPMA action within 6 months of your participation in the program, then the operator must either (1) go through the form eviction (“unlawful detainer”) court process, and/or (2) use a traditional civil harassment restraining order process to remove you.[1335]
</p>

<p>
  HOW could A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS?
</p>

<p>
  If the above requirements are all met, a transitional housing program operator may:
</p>

<p>
  Use the formal eviction/”unlawful detainer” court process (see the GENERAL RULE on PG. 501—the THPMA gives the transitional housing owner two options for evicting someone); OR
</p>

<p>
  If program misconduct or abuse: Use the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)/injunction process under the THPMA.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS THE TRO PROCESS?
</p>

<p>
  The TRO process is a 2-step process:
</p>

<p>
  STEP 1: The transitional housing program operator must file an application for an immediate temporary restraining order (TRO) until a hearing can take place. This immediate TRO may include orders that you (the program participant) refrain from misconduct, or it may exclude you from participating and living at the transitional housing program site, and stay at least 200 feet away from the site of abuse (defined above, PG. 502) was alleged.
</p>

<p>
  STEP 2: There is a hearing on permanent injunction—usually within in 5 days of the program operator filing the TRO. For the judge to issue a permanent injunction (permanent restraining order) at the hearing, there must be clear and convincing evidence of program misconduct or abuse by the participant.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT ARE “STAY AWAY” AND “EXCLUSION” ORDERS, AND WHEN CAN A PROGRAM OPERATOR GET ONE AGAINST ME?
</p>

<p>
  These types of orders are defined below:
</p>

<p>
  Exclusion Order: An exclusion order says that you are not allowed to participate or live at the program site.
</p>

<p>
  Stay Away Order: A stay away order says that you cannot be within 200 feet of the transitional housing program site or other program sites that it runs.
</p>

<p>
  A transitional housing program operator may only ask for exclusion and stay away orders for “abuse,” NOT for “program misconduct” (defined above on PG. 502). These orders can last for up to 1 year after the hearing, and the operator can ask the court to renew the restraining order after that (NOTE: the operator must ask for an extension of the exclusion or stay away order at least 3 months before the original one expires). 
</p>

<p>
  The program operator may also be able to get an immediate exclusion or stay away order from the court in a temporary restraining order (TRO) hearing—but only if it’s an emergency. It can only be considered an emergency if it’s necessary to protect another participant, employee, or person living within 100 feet of the program site from “imminent serious bodily injury.”
</p>

<p>
  WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR GETS AN EXCLUSION OR “STAY AWAY” ORDER?
</p>

<p>
  Before the hearing, through a TRO, the transitional housing program operator may have you immediately removed from the unit.
</p>

<p>
  After the hearing, the transitional housing program operator may take immediate possession of the unit and consider it “abandoned.” If there are other people living in the unit (for example, your family members), but those other people were not named in the restraining order petition, then the program operator may only remove you, and anyone actually named in the petition. A copy of the order will also be given to the local police.
</p>

<p>
  WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR DOESN’T GET AN EXCLUSION OR STAY AWAY ORDER?
</p>

<p>
  If you violate the conditions of the restraining order (also called a permanent injunction), the transitional housing program operator may:
</p>

<p>
  Serve you with a 3-day “notice to quit”—meaning you have 3 days to get you and your belongings out of the transitional housing program; and after the 3 days are up, the operator can start a formal eviction process in court (an “unlawful detainer’ action – learn more about these eviction lawsuits on PG. 454 above).
</p>

<p>
  File a “contempt” action in court along with a request (called a “petition”) to modify the exiting restraining order to include an exclusion order (EVEN IF the original action was based only on “program misconduct”),
</p>

<p>
  Finally, if you “willfully disobey” the court’s restraining order, you could be charged and possibly convicted of a criminal misdemeanor.
</p>

<p>
  Below, we have copied the instructions from the California Courts for someone who is participating in a transitional housing program covered by the THPMA and who receives restraining order papers. 
</p>

<p>
  You can download all forms related to the THPMA on the California Superior Court’s website at http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH.
</p>

<p>
  What STEPS does THE CALIFORNIA COURT suggest I TAKE IF YOU I’m being KICKED OUT OF TRANSITIONAL HOUSING UNDER THE Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)?
</p>

<p>
  The California Courts have published instructions for people who are facing removal from transitional housing under the THMPA. Those instructions are available on court form TH-210, available online at http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf, and also copied below for your reference.
</p>

<p>
  1. Legal advice. If you are served with an Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order ["OSC/TRO"] and a Petition, you should seek legal advice right away. The OSC/TRO should list the name, address, and phone number of the Legal Services Office in the county where the petition is filed. You may be able to get legal services by contacting this office. If you do not have an attorney, you can also call the attorney's referral service of your local bar association for help.
</p>

<p>
  2. Read the Instructions. Whether or not you choose to talk to an attorney, you should read all of these instructions and the other papers you have received.
</p>

<p>
  3. Obey the Order. Read the papers served on you very carefully. The Petition tells you what orders the program opera- tor is asking the court to make. The OSC/TRO tells you when to appear in court and may contain a temporary order telling you that you cannot do certain things. YOU HAVE TO OBEY THE ORDER. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE COURT'S ORDERS, CRIMINAL CHARGES MAY BE FILED AGAINST YOU. IF YOU ARE FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF COURT FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE COURT'S ORDERS, THE COURT CAN CHANGE THE ORDERS TO FORCE YOU TO MOVE OUT OF THE PROGRAM'S HOUSING.
</p>

<p>
  4. Review the facts. Read the description of the facts on the Petition very carefully. This is where the program operator tells the judge what he or she thinks happened. If you do not agree with the facts on the petition or you think it would not be fair for the court to grant orders against you, GO TO THE HEARING. The place and time of the hearing are on the first page of the form named "Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order."
</p>

<p>
  5. Respond to the court. If you want to fight the petition you should file a Participant's Response. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO FILE THIS FORM. A blank copy of the Response should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO. You can also file and serve statements signed by people who have personal knowledge of the facts. These are called "declarations." You can type these declarations on form MC-031 and attach them to your Response. If you do not know how to prepare a declaration, you should see an attorney.
</p>

<p>
  6. Serve a copy on program operator. After you have filed the Participant's Response with the superior court clerk, a copy must be delivered personally or by mail to the program operator or the program operator's attorney.
</p>

<p>
  You cannot serve the program operator yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process server, the sheriff's department, or any person 18 years of age or older, other than you. The person should complete and sign a Proof of Personal Service form. (A blank copy should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO.) You should take the completed form back to the court clerk or bring it with you to the hearing.
</p>

<p>
  7. Extensions. If you need more time to find an attorney or to prepare your Response, you must ask the judge for a continuance (extension) by the hearing date shown on the OSC/TRO.
</p>

<p>
  8. Opposing the Petition. If you wish to fight the lawsuit, you should file a Participant's Response and also go to the hearing. If you have any witnesses, they also must be present. If you do not attend the hearing, the court may make "permanent" orders against you that will last up to one year. If you can't file and serve a Response (or find an attorney who will), SHOW UP AT THE HEARING ANYWAY. At the hearing, explain your difficulties to the judge, and ask to be allowed to tell your side of the case.
