  <p>
    What can I do if I am unhappy with the written decision by the review hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are unhappy with the decision made at the review hearing, and want to challenge it further, ask the hearing officer or an attorney on how to challenge that decision. Usually, if you lose your informal hearing, you cannot continue to challenge the denial of government housing at the Public Housing Authority (PHA) level. Most likely, the only way for you to continue to challenge the denial after losing your informal review hearing is to sue the Public Housing Authority in court.[1257] This is a big decision and a lawyer can help you figure out your options, since ever individual case is different. Please contact Root & Rebound’s office for a referral or further guidance (Phone: 510-279-4662, Address: 1730 Franklin Street, Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94612).
