  <p>
    What important documents will I need to continue my education?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In general, these are the documents you’ll need to have ready as you apply for schools, programs, and financial aid. You may not need all of these, and/or may need others that are not on this list. Check the requirements listed on the school, program, or aid application to be absolutely sure. (NOTE: You can start the process of getting some of these documents while you are still incarcerated): 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    High school credential and/or transcripts (see PG. 1054)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    College credential and/or transcripts (see PG. 1067)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Immunization/Vaccination Records (see PG. 1033)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Letters of Recommendation (see PG. 1075); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    List of References (people who can speak positively of you to schools or programs where you apply)[2594] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Social Security Number/Card (see BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 41)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Authorized birth certificate (see BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 32)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    California state ID or driver license (see BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, on PG. 48)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Criminal record or RAP sheet (see UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For males only: Selective Service registration[2595] (If you were incarcerated during the time when you were supposed to have registered with the Selective Service, you may be able to get a “Status Information Letter” to get around this ban—see BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 90) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What are “immunization/vaccination records” and why do I need them? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your immunization record (also called your vaccination record) is a list of all the vaccines (medicines) you received as a child and as an adult that prevent common diseases like polio, chicken pox and tuberculosis. It is required to register for school, for certain jobs, and/or to travel abroad.
