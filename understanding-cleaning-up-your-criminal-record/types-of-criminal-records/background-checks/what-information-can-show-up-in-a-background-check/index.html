  <p>
    What information can show up in a background check?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the age of the Internet, there is a lot of information that could show up in your background check report. For example, it may contain information about:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Criminal convictions;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other court cases you were involved in (for example, lawsuits, small claims court cases, money judgments against you, etc.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your driving record;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Previous employment;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Education records;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Property ownership records;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bankruptcies and tax liens;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Professional licensing records;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Previous addresses; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Past evictions; AND 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Personal references from people who know you (such as past employers, private landlords, neighbors, etc.).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although anyone can look up public records or information on the Internet about you, there are special laws that limit WHO & WHEN someone can run a background check on you if they use a private (“commercial”) background check company. In general, the people who can run a private background check on you include: employers, private landlords, insurance companies, professional licensing agencies, creditors, anyone with a court order or subpoena, and anyone seeking child support payments from you. (For a list of who can legally run a background check on you, see PG. 1152.) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition, there are laws that protect you by limiting the information that can show up in a private background check report, and give you the chance to correct any errors that show up. For a list of what information CAN & CANNOT be included in your private background check, see PG. 1144-1145.
