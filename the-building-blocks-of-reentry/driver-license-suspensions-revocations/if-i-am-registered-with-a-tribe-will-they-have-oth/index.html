  <p>
    If I am registered with a tribe, will they have other identification documents on file for me or my family members?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on the tribe and whether you are enrolled. If you are already enrolled with a tribe and trying to recover old identification (ID) documents, you can contact your tribe directly and ask if they have any of those documents on file. There is no guarantee, but it’s worth checking!

    LIBRARY CARD
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WHAT WILL I LEARN?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why a library card is useful, and how to make the most of resources at the libraryHow to find your local public libraryWhat documents and information to bring to the library when you go to apply for a library cardWhat to do if you want a library card but don’t have photo ID How to submit your application for a library card
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What are the benefits of having a library card? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A library card is FREE and provides access to your local public library. At the library, you will have access to the Internet, a world of information, and entertainment. Some useful benefits are:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free access to books and media materials. Public libraries contain all kinds of books, movies, music, newspapers, magazines, and more. Anyone can visit a public library and use these materials on-site. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free access to helpful librarians. Public libraries have librarians on staff who are trained to help with all kinds of research questions. Anyone can walk in and get free research help from a librarian.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free access to computers and the Internet. Most public libraries have computer labs where anyone can go online for FREE. You can use email, search for information, and visit websites. This can make it much easier to contact people, find jobs and services, do research for school, and look up news and information.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free access to classes, programs, and events. Many public libraries provide free trainings, computer services, and educational programs and events for community members of all ages. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why would I get a library card?[242]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although anyone can visit a public library and use certain resources there, you need a library card to borrow books and other materials (to use them outside of the building). Also, in some libraries, you may need to get a library card before you can use the Internet or computers.
