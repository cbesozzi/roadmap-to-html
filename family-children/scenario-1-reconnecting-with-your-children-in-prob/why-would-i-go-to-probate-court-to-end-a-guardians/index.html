  <h2><a href="/family-children/scenario-1-reconnecting-with-your-children-in-prob/why-would-i-go-to-probate-court-to-end-a-guardians/index.html">Why would I go to probate court to end a guardianship?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Why would I go to probate court to end a guardianship?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You would go to probate court to end a guardianship if someone else (other than the child’s parents) was given guardianship of your child while you were incarcerated. If a judge in probate court formally created the guardianship, then you have to go to probate court to end it. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If I have been incarcerated and someone else is the guardian of my child, what are my legal rights as a parent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Guardianship does NOT end your parental rights; it only puts your parental rights on hold while the guardian has custody of the child.[2311] This allows the guardian(s) to make all the decisions about caring for the child that a parent would make, without permanently cutting off the parents’ rights to ask for custody of their child back in the future.[2312]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Parent’s Rights:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The child’s legal or biological parents still have certain rights for their child during the guardianship:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The children in a guardianship are still considered legally and biologically “related” to their parents (the parents’ rights are not terminated);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The judge or the guardian of the child can allow the parents or other relatives to visit with the children in a guardianship;[2313]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When the judge appoints a guardian to have custody of a child, the judge may also give visitation rights to the child’s parent(s) and/or sibling(s) to visit the child
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the judge orders visitation, the child’s guardian must allow these visits to take place. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If there is no court order for visitation, the guardian has the right to decide whether the child may visit with his/her parent(s) or other relatives. So if you don't have a court order and the guardian is not letting you see your child, you might need to go to Probate Court to ask the judge for visitation. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Please Note: You will need to ask for visitation from the same probate court that appointed your child’s current guardian, which may be in a different county from where you live. You will also need to use that county’s own specific probate court forms to request visitation.[2314]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Parent’s Responsibilities:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The child’s legal or biological parents also still have certain responsibilities for their child during the guardianship:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Parents must continue to financially support their children in a guardianship (including paying child support if it’s ordered – read more about child support on PG. 960. Also, children in a guardianship can inherit money or get Social Security benefits from their parents.[2315]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are currently or about to become incarcerated and would like to learn how to pause your child support payments, see PG. 962 in the “Child Support” section.
