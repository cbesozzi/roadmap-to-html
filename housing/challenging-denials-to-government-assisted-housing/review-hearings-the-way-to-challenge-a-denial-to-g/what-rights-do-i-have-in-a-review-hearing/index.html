  <p>
    What rights do I have in a review hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have the right to a hearing before an impartial, unbiased hearing officer.[1249] That means that hearing officer should be independent, with no stake in the outcome of the hearing, and ready to hear both sides. He/she should not be the same person who made the original decision to deny you, or anyone who works for the person who made the original decision to deny you.[1250]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have the right to an opportunity to make an argument (called a “rebuttal”) to challenge the information the PHA or owner relied upon in denying you.[1251]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should be allowed to explain why you pled guilty to a past conviction.[1252] The hearing’s decision maker may find your explanation important and relevant.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should ask for a written transcript and an audio recording of the review hearing (the “record”). If the hearing officer won’t provide you this, you can ask to bring in your own recording device (many cell phones have this function).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Question witnesses, and to ask that they testify under oath.[1253]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The right to a written decision after the review hearing (for most government-assisted housing programs).[1254] The written decision must be given to you within a reasonable period of time (usually 10-30 days), state the reasons for the decision, and state the evidence the hearing officer relied upon in making a decision.[1255]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Extra Rights for Public Housing & Voucher housing programs: In addition to the requirements above, for public housing and the voucher program ONLY, there is the additional protection that the subject of the hearing can only go into the issues that were presented in the rejection notice.[1256] At the hearing, no information should be presented if it was not the basis for the rejection, because otherwise you don’t have an opportunity to investigate ahead of time and challenge that new information at the hearing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Rules for Rural Development (RD) housing hearings are different. To learn about that process, see APPENDIX I, PG. 500.
