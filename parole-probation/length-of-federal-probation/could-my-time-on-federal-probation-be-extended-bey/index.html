  <p>
    Could my time on federal probation be extended beyond the original sentence?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes, but only if you were not originally given the maximum term on federal probation that would be allowed by law. The judge may extend your probation at any time before the end of your sentence, but must give you a hearing before doing so. At that court hearing, the judge can make your probation term longer if he or she did not originally give you the maximum authorized term.[768]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A judge may extend your time on federal probation instead of sending you to jail if he or she finds you violated your conditions of probation (see PG. 239 which discusses conditions of federal probation). The maximum amount of time you’ll spend on federal probation supervision depends on whether you were convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, or infraction. Look at PG. 238 to figure out the maximum amount of time you could spend on federal probation.
