  <p>
    Will the PHA or owner screen me for my credit history if I am someone’s live-in aide?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No. The PHA or owner should not screen you for your credit history if you are a live-in aide. Your credit history has nothing to do with the family’s ability to pay for the unit—so you should not be screened for credit.[1235]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was excluded from being someone’s live-in aide based on my criminal record. What can I do? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    THE PERSON REQUIRING AID SHOULD ASK FOR A REVIEW HEARING. Go to PG. 408 to learn how (s)he can challenge this denial of you as his/her live-in aide.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There may be situations in which the disabled/elderly resident needing the care has great difficulty finding a live-in aide, or that you meet some unique need of that individual requiring care. In such situations, the disabled/elderly individual needing the live-in aide may request a reasonable accommodation for a disability by asking the PHA or owner to waive its strict screening criteria, and allow the person with the criminal record to reside in the unit as a live-in aide due to the special function he or she plays in the tenant’s life.
