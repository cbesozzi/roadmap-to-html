          <h1>How do I pay off the court fines, penalties, and administrative fees?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153541"></a>How do I pay off the court fines, penalties, and administrative fees?</h3>
          <p class="text">As discussed on PG. 819, court fines and penalties are debts you may incur as punishment or consequences for the crime you were charged with. Court administrative fees are the fees that are paid for the daily operation of the court. While these two debts are different, here these debts are discussed together because they are usually grouped together (totaled) when discussing how much you owe the court and require you to pay both fees together and to pay these fees to one office. </p>
          <p><strong>The process for collecting court fines and fees is complicated and may be different from county to county. In general, you can follow these instructions:</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2201" id="footnote-ref-2201">[2169]</a></sup></p>
          <h4 class="step">Contact the court(s) where you were convicted </h4>
          <p class="text">See PG. 837 (Step 1 on how to find out how much you owe in court fines and administrative fees) for instructions on how to identify and contact the court(s) where you were convicted.</p>
          <h4 class="step">Find out who is in charge of collecting your debt and contact them</h4>
          <p class="text">Different counties have different methods for collecting court fines and fees. Depending on where you are located, collection may be handled by different agencies, including the court itself, a county agency, a private collection agency, or the Franchise Tax Board. See PG. 837 above (Steps 2-3 on how to find out how much you owe in court fines and administrative fees) for instructions on how to identify and contact the agency(ies) in charge of collecting your debt.</p>
          <p class="text">Remember that your debts may be collected by several different collection agencies, so you may need to contact each of these different agencies about making payments. </p>
          <h4 class="step">Discuss your payment options.</h4>
          <p class="text">When you contact the collection agency or court that’s in charge of your debt, a representative can help you design a payment plan that works best for your situation. The goal is to create a plan that will prevent you from facing extra fees or other penalties (like a hold on your DMV record) that can result from late or insufficient payments. </p>
          <p class="text">It is important to be open and honest about your current financial situation, including whether or not you have a job, pay child support, or owe any other debts or payments. Most of the time, the collection representative will take these things into account and work with you to create a plan that you can realistically stick to.</p>
          <p class="text">Depending on your individual situation and the amount of money you owe, the collection agency may ask you to pay everything off right away. In other situations, they may allow you to set up a payment plan so that you make smaller payments over time. Remember that the agency or court might charge a fee to cover the costs of managing your payment plan, and might charge additional fees for each payment you make.<sup><a href="#footnote-2202" id="footnote-ref-2202">[2170]</a></sup> Collection agencies can also charge BIG penalty fees for any late payments (or even demand that you pay off the entire remaining amount due). <em>Make sure you ask about fees and penalties and/or read the fine print before you agree to a payment plan!</em><strong> </strong></p>
