  <p>
    What do I need to know about the relationship between my disabilities and my criminal record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you can show that your disability caused your conviction, you may be able to ask an employer to make “reasonable accommodations” for your situation—for example, by making an exception to a policy against hiring people with your type of conviction, or by considering your criminal record under an easier standard. At least 2 federal courts have agreed that employers can be required to provide reasonably accommodations for employees whose workplace violations were caused by prior substance abuse, after the employees had later completed rehab programs. See more examples of reasonable accommodations during the job search, and when you apply, on PG. 761.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have suffered from one of the conditions listed above, it is possible that your criminal conviction(s) may have been the result of your disability—in other words, you committed the offense because of your mental illness or past drug or alcohol addiction.
