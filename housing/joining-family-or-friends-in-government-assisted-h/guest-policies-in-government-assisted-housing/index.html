            <h3><a id="_Toc352861462"></a>I have a record and want to temporarily visit or stay overnight as a guest with my family in their government-assisted housing unit. What are some suggested steps I can take to avoid putting my family or friend‚Äôs housing assistance at risk?</h3>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>(1) If you are planning to stay for only 1 night as a guest:</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text">People living in government-assisted housing <em>are usually allowed</em> to have overnight guests. For federal government-assisted housing, federal regulations define the term ‚Äúguest‚Äù as ‚Äúa person temporarily staying in the unit with the consent of a tenant.‚Äù<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1318" id="footnote-ref-1318">[1317]</a></sup></sup></span><em> </em>The person living in the government-assisted housing unit should not be required to register or seek prior approval for an overnight guest (unless that guest is otherwise banned from being there). The owner of the government-assisted housing should allow the tenant to host guests for a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù amount of time,<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1319" id="footnote-ref-1319">[1318]</a></sup></sup></span> which is usually 14 to 30 days, depending on the PHA or owner‚Äôs policy.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1320" id="footnote-ref-1320">[1319]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
            <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Sometimes an individual CANNOT stay as a guest or visit government-assisted property AT ALL. For example, if someone committed a criminal offense on the property, the PHA and owner of the housing may be legally allowed to ban that person from ever returning. Someone could also have a parole or probation condition that forbids them from being on the property. For this reason, you want to be careful to know the rules of that PHA or owner AND know your rules of probation or parole.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>(2) If you are planning to stay for longer than 1 night as a guest:</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text">You want to be careful to know the rules of that PHA or owner about ‚ÄúUnauthorized Occupants.‚Äù There are situations where, instead of being seen as a ‚Äúguest‚Äù‚Äîeven if that‚Äôs what you and your family consider you to truly be‚Äîthe PHA or owner might classify you as an ‚Äúunauthorized occupant,‚Äù a resident living in that housing unit without permission of the PHA or owner and against the rules. Being seen as an unauthorized occupant is a big problem for many reasons:</p>
            <ol class="text">Your income and/or assets (for example, any savings or major property you own) could affect the amount of rental assistance that your family receives. The total income might be too high for the family to qualify for any assistance at all. This could lead to your family being evicted from the unit or losing its financial assistance for the housing unit.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Just by being in the apartment, you might be violating the lease or the owner‚Äôs or PHA‚Äôs guest policies and subject your family to eviction.</ol>
            <p class="text">If you want to stay as a guest for a longer period, you need to know the PHA or owner‚Äôs time limit on the number of back-to-back days OR number of total days in a year that a guest may stay in the government-assisted housing unit and still be considered a ‚Äúguest.‚Äù </p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Again, find out the PHA‚Äôs and owner‚Äôs rules and do not break them. Check the lease and the PHA‚Äôs and owner‚Äôs policies. There is usually a period of time stated in the lease and/or in the PHA‚Äôs or owner‚Äôs policies that defines when a guest becomes an ‚Äúunauthorized occupant.‚Äù</p>
            <h4 class="textbox">Special Guest Policy Rules for Specific Government-Assisted Housing Programs:<br/>Section 8 Vouchers and Rural Development Housing</h4>
            <p class="textbox"><strong><em>Section 8 Vouchers programs:</em></strong> Some PHAs have established guest policies for Section 8 voucher participants, limiting the time period that persons not listed as household members can stay with a tenant.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1321" id="footnote-ref-1321">[1320]</a></sup></sup></span> PHAs should inform participants of these policies and give them an opportunity to request that anyone living there for a longer period be added to the household.<strong><em>Rural Development (RD) programs:</em></strong> Federal regulations require that all RD leases ‚Äúinclude provisions that establish when a guest will be considered a member of the household and be required to be added to the tenant certification.‚Äù<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1322" id="footnote-ref-1322">[1321]</a></sup></sup></span> Also, the owner of the property must post this same information in its occupancy rules.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1323" id="footnote-ref-1323">[1322]</a></sup></sup></span> That means that although there is no standard amount of time required by law, the owner still <em>must</em> <em>include</em> its guest policies in the agency-approved lease used with tenants. As with the other programs, preapproval and registration of guests should not be required and the amount of time that a tenant may have a guest should be a reasonable period. However, if the guest was a former tenant who committed a drug violation and was evicted, then the owner may require that the tenant obtain approval before the guest may visit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1324" id="footnote-ref-1324">[1323]</a></sup></sup></span></p>

            <p class="text">Yes, you can try to negotiate with the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property.</p>
            <p class="text">For example, if your family is seeking to add you to the lease‚Äîbut the screening process to add you to the lease <em>TAKES LONGER</em> than the amount of time the family is allowed to have you as a guest‚Äîyour family, or an advocate working on your behalf, may be able to negotiate with the housing provider at the start to extend the period of time that you are allowed to stay as a guest in that government-assisted household.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1325" id="footnote-ref-1325">[1324]</a></sup></sup></span> If your family can negotiate a policy that allows you to stay longer as their guest, this helps avoid problems later on if the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing accuses your family of exceeding the time limits for guests, in violation of their lease agreement.</p>

            <p class="text">Your family member (whomever is listed on the lease) can request a REVIEW HEARING (sometimes call a grievance hearing, informal review, informal hearing, or conference)! Go to PG.¬†359 to learn about how to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing and request a review hearing.</p>
