<h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153114"></a>Special needs housing—short- or long-term</h3>

<p class="text">Again, as mentioned under short-term housing options, there are special housing programs and units for people with specific needs such as addiction treatment and recovery, safety from domestic violence, assisted living for people with disabilities or mental health needs, housing programs for women with children, veterans, and 290 sex offender registrants These are often transitional housing programs that are for a short term only; but others are intended to be a long-term, permanent housing solution for people with special needs. See below for more details. </p>
