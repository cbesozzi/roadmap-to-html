  Court administrative fees
</p>

<p>
  What are court administrative fees? 
</p>

<p>
  Administrative fees are money you pay to the courts, county, and other agencies to cover the day-to-day costs of running the courts and criminal justice system. Administrative fees are used to pay for things like court security, probation supervision, public defender fees, jail time, and debt collection.[2043] Some fees are imposed by the court; other fees are imposed by the county or by other agencies.
</p>

<p>
  What should I know about court administrative fees? 
</p>

<p>
  Administrative fees generally CANNOT be conditions of probation, because they are NOT intended as punishment.[2044] One exception to this rule is the Criminal Justice Administration Fee (sometimes referred to as the jail booking fee), which CAN be a condition of probation.[2045]
</p>

<p>
  Most administrative fees are imposed only if you are able to pay them.[2046] Often, these fees can be waived.[2047]
