  <h1>What is Proposition 47 and how could it help me?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153934"></a>What is Proposition 47 and how could it help me?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Proposition 47 (Prop 47) is a law that was passed by voters in California and took effect in November of 2014.<sup><a href="#footnote-3021" id="footnote-ref-3021">[2987]</a></sup> Prop 47 changed the law so that certain <em>non-violent</em> offenses that previously could be charged as “wobblers” or straight felonies now can <em>only</em> be charged as straight misdemeanors. Prop 47 also applies to <em>past</em> convictions, which means that you might be able to get your past felony convictions changed to misdemeanors if they meet the requirements under the new law. If you are still serving a sentence for a conviction that qualifies for Prop 47, you may be able to get your sentence reduced. </p>
  
  <p class="text">IMPORTANT UPDATE:  The deadline to file Prop 47 applications has been extended to November 4, 2022!</p>
