          <h3><a id="_Toc317247496"></a><a id="_Toc448153596"></a>Why would I go to family court to reconnect with my child or grandchild?</h3>
          <p class="text">You may go to family court cases about divorce or <strong><em>separation; child support; paternity/parentage questions; and/or custody and visitation disagreements</em></strong> between parents or caregivers (so long as CPS is NOT involved).<sup><a href="#footnote-2324" id="footnote-ref-2324">[2292]</a></sup> A family court judge may make decisions and orders related to any of these types of cases.</p>
          <p class="text">Additionally, in some <strong><em>probate court cases</em></strong>, the judge making decisions about a <strong><em>probate guardianship</em></strong> will transfer a case <strong>from <em>probate court</em> to <em>family court</em></strong> if a biological parent ACTIVELY OBJECTS to the guardianship placement. The probate court tends to see this type of a dispute as a custody disagreement better suited for family courts to handle. Read more about probate court guardianships beginning on PG. 924.</p>
          <p class="text">To learn about <em>alternatives</em> to going to family court, see PG. 922.</p>
