        <p class="text">If you are taking care of someone else‚Äôs child and want support, you may be able to get financial help as a guardian through child support from the child‚Äôs parents or government assistance (called ‚Äúpublic benefits‚Äù).<sup><a href="#footnote-2365" id="footnote-ref-2365">[2333]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">&gt; For more information on how to request child support in family court, see PG.¬†918.</p>
        <p class="text">&gt; Examples of government assistance include the public benefits explained below:</p>
        <ol class="text"><em>CalWorks:</em> If you are related to the child, you can get CalWorks even if you do not need the money. You can also get CalWorks if you are not related to the child but you need financial help. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Foster care payments:</em> Some guardians can get this. The amount may be more than welfare.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Kin-GAP (Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment Program):</em> This is for people who are related to a child in a juvenile dependency case. It pays the same amount as foster care payments.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>SSI (Supplemental Security Income):</em> If the child has a disability, he/she may be able to get SSI or state disability benefits. You can use this money to take care of the child.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Medi-Cal:</em> Guardians can get this for the child and for themselves if they are financially needy and are related to the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2366" id="footnote-ref-2366">[2334]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">Ask the social worker on your case about what help you can get.</p>
