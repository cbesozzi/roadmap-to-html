<h1>Women & Children</h1>

<p>
  Women & Children
</p>

<p>
  There are some special housing programs available only for women and their children. These programs may have other requirements (for example, that you are currently on supervision, participating in a substance abuse recovery program, etc.), and they may require a referral from CDCR or another agency.
</p>

<p>
  Since there aren’t many of these programs and they have limited in space, you should contact the program and/or talk to your correctional counselor as soon as possible about contacting the housing program, finding out if you meet the eligibility requirements to participate, and how to get added to the waitlist if there is one.
</p>

<p>
  Below are a few programs in different areas of California for reentering women and children. Please Note: This is not a complete list.
</p>

<p>

  The MOMS program is located inside Alameda County’s Santa Rita County Jail. It includes an 8-week, in-custody parenting program AND a post-release case management for up to one year, including services, alumni groups, and some limited transitional housing.

</p>

<p>
  HELPFUL HINT: starting in a shelter before moving into other housing
</p>

<p>
  Starting off in an emergency shelter may help you to find transitional or permanent housing and/or access other services afterward. Although many transitional housing programs and social service providers will run background checks and have record-related restrictions, if you are living at a domestic violence shelter, the staff may be able to write a letter or provide a referral to a transitional housing program, which can help explain your situation and get around their restrictions.
