          <h4 class="sidebox">A Note ABOUT Traffic TICKETS:</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Sometimes it can take several weeks for your ticket to show up in the court’s computer system. If you call the court and they don’t have a record of your ticket yet, don’t be discouraged! You may have to call back again later to get your question answered. </p>
          <p class="text">It depends on the type of traffic fine.</p>
          <h4>For parking tickets</h4>
          <p class="text">Talk to the parking agency (or collection agency, if your parking fines were sent to collections) about setting up a <em>payment plan</em>. Keep in mind that the payment plan may charge additional fees, as well as big penalties for missed payments—<em>so make sure to ask about any fees and penalties before you sign up!</em></p>
          <h4>For misdemeanor and infraction tickets</h4>
          <p class="text">A recent change in California law has created a statewide Traffic Amnesty Program to help people who reduce old traffic court debt that qualifies and/or reinstate driver licenses suspended due to that old traffic debt. There are eligibility requirements, so keep reading to learn more about this new program.</p>
