  <p>
    Which types of court-ordered debt are likely to be conditions of my probation?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Restitution—Making restitution payments will almost ALWAYS be a condition of your probation.[2067]Other Fines & Penalties—Some other fines and penalties may also be conditions of your probation. However, each type of fine and fee is different, so you will need to check your specific sentencing order to see which payments are conditions of your probation. Fines and fees that are always (or almost always) conditions of your probation:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Victim restitution +10% interest;[2068]Restitution fine +10% administrative fee;Fine and penalty assessment (amount based on your conviction offense);Criminal Justice Administration Fee (jail booking fee).[2069] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fines that may be conditions of your probation, depending on your conviction offense:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Domestic Violence Fund Payment;[2070]Alcohol Abuse Education & Prevention Penalty Assessment;[2071] Emergency Response Cost Restitution;[2072]Hate Crime Restitution;[2073]Abduction Restitution.[2074]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Administrative Fees—In general, administrative fees CANNOT be conditions of probation.[2075] This includes things like court security fees, probation supervision costs, and attorney fees.[2076] However, one exception to this rule is the Criminal Justice Administration Fee (sometimes referred to as the jail booking fee), which CAN be a condition of probation.[2077]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: These are only some examples. YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR SENTENCING ORDER TO SEE WHICH FINES AND FEES ARE CONDITIONS OF YOUR PROBATION.
