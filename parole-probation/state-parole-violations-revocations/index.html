          <h1>State Parole Violations & Revocations</h1>
          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448152839"></a>Sta<a id="stateparoleREVOCATION"></a>te Parole Violations &amp; Revocations</h2>
          <p><em>Under AB 109, California’s “Realignment” law, there were major changes to the procedures required for California state parole revocations. These changes took effect on July 1, 2013.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-566" id="footnote-ref-566">[541]</a></sup><em> The new rules for revocation hearings laws are explained in this section. </em></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152840"></a>How did Realignment Change the way parole revocation hearings work (as of july 1, 2013)?</h3>
          <p class="listparagraph">CHANGE TO WHO HEARS THE CASE</p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE FOR former “LIFERS”:</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">This change in the law means that if you were a “lifer” in prison, your parole revocation hearing will be before the BPH, not the local county superior court.</p>
          <p>The biggest change is that local county superior courts will now hear most parole revocation cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-567" id="footnote-ref-567">[542]</a></sup> Before July 1, 2013, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) was responsible for hearing all parole revocation cases, and now that responsibility has mostly shifted to the courts.<sup><a href="#footnote-568" id="footnote-ref-568">[543]</a></sup> Superior court judges will hear these cases in state court.<sup><a href="#footnote-569" id="footnote-ref-569">[544]</a></sup> One idea behind this change was to create more transparency and fairness by having independent, unbiased judges hear the cases and weigh the evidence. </p>
          <p>However, the BPH will continue to hear certain cases — specifically:</p>
          <ol class="text">Parole consideration for lifers (also called “parole suitability hearings”);</ol>
          <ol class="text">Medical parole hearings; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Cases regarding mentally disordered offenders (MDOs); and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Cases regarding “sexually violent predators.” </ol>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>CHANGE TO WHERE YOU SERVE A SENTENCE FOR A PAROLE VIOLATION</strong></p>
          <ol class="text">If your parole is revoked for a violation that occurred <em>on or after July 1, 2013</em>, you will be sentenced to COUNTY JAIL, not state prison. </ol>
          <ol class="text">If your parole is revoked for a violation that occurred <em>before July 1, 2013</em>, you would have been sent back to STATE PRISON. so this is a big change in the law.</ol>
          <ol class="text">EXCEPTION: This change does not apply to a parolee who is classified as a “serious offender” — meaning a parolee who was a life-term prisoner under California Penal Code § 3000.1, or one who was convicted of certain sex offenses under California Penal Code § 3000(a)(4)). If you fall under this classification, you will still be sent back to state prison to serve time for a parole revocation. The BPH retains control of your case, and will later decide whether to release you back onto parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-570" id="footnote-ref-570">[545]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>CHANGE TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU SERVE</strong></p>
          <p>If you serve your parole violation (revocation) term in county jail, you will serve a maximum of <strong>180 days</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-571" id="footnote-ref-571">[546]</a></sup> Most people serve their parole revocation terms in county jails. </p>
          <p>But if you are a former lifer, you may serve a maximum of <strong>12 months</strong> in prison for a parole violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-572" id="footnote-ref-572">[547]</a></sup> If your maximum parole period is life-long (this may be true if your commitment offense was murder or a sex offense), you may be sentenced to up to a year in prison for a revocation — and, at some point during that year, the BPH may determine that you should be incarcerated longer.<sup><a href="#footnote-573" id="footnote-ref-573">[548]</a></sup></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152841"></a>If I am suspected of a parole violation, who has authority to arrest me? Do they need a warrant?</h3>
          <p class="text">A parole agent or police officer can arrest you if he or she has <em>probable cause</em> to believe you violated a parole condition. (By law, a belief supported by “probable cause” is defined as the reasonable belief of a reasonable person looking at the specific facts of the situation.)<sup><a href="#footnote-574" id="footnote-ref-574">[549]</a></sup> BUT the arresting agent/officer <em>does not need a warrant</em>. A judge COULD issue a warrant for your arrest, but does not have to.<sup> </sup>(Cal. Penal Code § 3000.08(c)). If the parole agent suspects that you have violated a parole condition, you can be arrested by a parole agent or peace office at any time until the judge makes a “final disposition” ( a final decision about your guilt or innocence in the case).<sup><a href="#footnote-575" id="footnote-ref-575">[550]</a></sup></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152842"></a>What happens if I am arrested for an alleged parole violation? </h3>
          <p>Here is what you can expect if you are arrested for an alleged parole violation:</p>
          <ol class="text">After an arrest, a CDCR parole agent can place you on “hold” — meaning he or she can place you in jail until further proceedings take place.<sup><a href="#footnote-576" id="footnote-ref-576">[551]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">Once you are on “hold,” parole staff decides if there is “good cause” to believe that you violated a law or parole condition. The staff does not have to hold a hearing or give you a chance to provide more information, but they have to make this decision among themselves.<sup><a href="#footnote-577" id="footnote-ref-577">[552]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">What happens next? It depends on whether CDCR staff finds probable cause to believe you committed the alleged violation.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If CDCR staff does not find probable cause, you will be re-released on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-578" id="footnote-ref-578">[553]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If CDCR staff does find probable cause, they must decide whether “intermediate sanctions” can address the violation, or whether a formal revocation proceeding needs to happen. Intermediate sanctions might include:	</ol>
          <ol class="text">New parole conditions;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Sending you to a special reentry court;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Requiring your participation in treatment or rehabilitation programs; or</ol>
          <ol class="text">“Flash incarceration,” which is detention in the county jail for up to 10 consecutive days.<sup><a href="#footnote-579" id="footnote-ref-579">[554]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">If CDCR staff decides that intermediate sanctions are not enough, they will file a formal parole revocation petition in the local superior court.<sup><a href="#footnote-580" id="footnote-ref-580">[555]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">The CDCR’s petition should describe:</ol>
          <ol class="text">The relevant conditions of parole;</ol>
          <ol class="text">The circumstances of the violation;</ol>
          <ol class="text">The history and background of the parolee (you); and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Parole staff’s recommendations for disposition (meaning: their recommendations as to what the outcome of the parole revocation petition should be). </ol>
          <ol class="text">At this point, CDCR staff should inform you of your rights, including: (1) the right to consult with an attorney, and (2) if you can’t afford to hire an attorney, the right to have the court appoint a free attorney for you (the public defender). We recommend that you consult with an attorney or public defender before waiving (giving up) any rights.</ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORANT: The CDCR may inform you that you have the right to waive both your right to an attorney and your right to a hearing, admit the parole violation, and accept the CDCR’s proposed revocation term (sometimes called a “screening offer”). The waiver of an attorney or hearing must be in writing.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-581" id="footnote-ref-581">[556]</a></sup></strong> Again, before you waive any rights, WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU ASK TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY, AND IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE, THAT YOU WAIT FOR YOUR FREE ATTORNEY TO MEET WITH YOU. Please note: There is currently no timeline required for these steps to happen, which is concerning.</p>
          <p>Currently, the law does not set any timelines for parole revocation steps.<sup><a href="#footnote-582" id="footnote-ref-582">[557]</a></sup> CDCR staff are supposed to make a probable cause determination within 2 business days after a hold is placed on you, notify you of your charges and rights within 3 business days after the hold, and either file a revocation petition with the court or release you within 7 business days after the hold. But these timelines are not formal regulations, and the CDCR is not obligated to enforce them.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">SUMMARYIf I have been arrested for an alleged parole violation, what three types of actions can parole staff decide to take against me?</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">Intermediate sanctions: new parole conditions, reentry court, and treatment or rehabilitation programs.Flash incarceration for up to 10 days. No court involvement required.<sup><a href="#footnote-583" id="footnote-ref-583">[558]</a></sup>Petition the local superior court for a formal revocation under California Penal Code § 1203.2.<sup><a href="#footnote-584" id="footnote-ref-584">[559]</a></sup></ul>
