  <p class="text">Both a California state ID and a California driver license serve as an official government-issued, photo identification that can be used to prove your identity, age, and legal presence* in the United States. Either one will allow you to prove your identity, for example, when you open a bank account, when you register to vote, or when you apply for jobs, housing, or public benefits. </p>
  
  <p class="text">If you eventually want to <em>drive</em>, you will need to get a driver license, but because that process requires testing, we recommend that you get a California state ID first, so that you can get an official ID faster. Once you get a California state ID, you can <em>always</em> go back and take a driving test to get your driver license. But this allows you to have official ID easily and quickly. </p>

  <p class="importantbox"><a id="DL_Undocumented"></a>*** A NOTE IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED:As of January 1, 2015, if you cannot provide proof of legal presence in the United States, but otherwise qualify for a California driver license, you can apply for a “non-ID” license. If you hold this license, you can legally drive a motor vehicle in CA; but it won’t count as a government-issued proof of identity, and it will not prove legal presence in the United States for any purpose.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-63" id="footnote-ref-63">[63]</a></sup></sup></strong> Also read the note on PG. 68 to learn about other forms of ID in California for undocumented people. </p>
