  <p>
    Can an employer discriminate against me because of my race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No. Sometimes there is racism (or other discrimination against a protected class) in addition to discrimination based on criminal history. This happens when an employer weighs your criminal history more heavily or negatively because of your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected class. This is absolutely illegal, but needs to be proven. The next question will explain what to do and how you may be able to prove that an employer used your criminal record to discriminate against you based on your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected class. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember: Race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and national origin are all protected classes—meaning they are illegal reasons to discriminate against someone. For more information, and a complete list of all protected classes, see PG. 733 above.
