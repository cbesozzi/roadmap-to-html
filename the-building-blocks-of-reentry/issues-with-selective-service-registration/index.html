          <h3><a id="_Toc328831333"></a>I registered with the Selective Service, but I lost my registration number and my proof of registration. How can I get these? </h3>
          <p class="text">Contact the Selective Service to request your number and get new proof of registration. Be ready to provide your <em>name, birthdate, Social Security Number, </em>AND<em> current mailing address.</em> <strong>TO CONTACT:</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>By phone:</em> Call 1-847-688-6888. </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>By mail:</em> Mail a request to Selective Service System; P.O. Box 94638; Palatine, IL 60094-4638.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>Online:</em> Visit </strong><a href="http://www.sss.gov"><strong>http://www.sss.gov</strong></a><strong> and click “Check Registration.” You’ll need to enter your SSN.</strong></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc328831334"></a>It’s been more than 30 days since I turned 18, and I haven’t registered with the Selective Service. Can I still register? </h3>
          <ol class="text">IF YOU ARE AGE 25 OR YOUNGER, then YES, you can still register. You should do so immediately!<sup><a href="#footnote-299" id="footnote-ref-299">[299]</a></sup> To register, follow the steps listed above on PG. 91<em>.</em></ol>
          <ol class="text"><em> </em>IF YOU ARE AGE 26 OR OLDER, it’s probably too late to register. HOWEVER, if you have <em>good reasons</em> for not registering earlier — such as being incarcerated continuously between the ages of 18 and 25 — then you might be able to get an official “Status Information Letter” from the Selective Service stating that you were not required to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-300" id="footnote-ref-300">[300]</a></sup> To learn how to request a Status Information Letter, go to PG. 93.</ol>
