  <h2><a href="/understanding-cleaning-up-your-criminal-record/governors-pardon/once-i-have-applied-for-a-pardon-what-happens/index.html">Once I have applied for a pardon, what happens?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Once I have applied for a pardon, what happens?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What happens next will be different, depending on how you applied for a Pardon:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pardon With Certificate of Rehabilitation
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When the judge grants your COR, he will also send a copy of your COR directly to the Governor’s Office.[3106] Once the Governor receives your COR, s/he can do any of the following:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Grant your pardon immediately (if you have only 1 felony conviction);[3107]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have 2 or more felony convictions
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted of more than one felony, the Governor is required to have the Board of Parole Hearings review your case, regardless of whether you were issued a Certificate of Rehabilitation. Also, if you have two or more felony convictions, the Governor cannot grant you a pardon without a recommendation from the California Supreme Court, however, the Governor is not required to send your application to the Supreme Court for review. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do an investigation and review your case to decide whether to grant your pardon; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ask the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) to investigate your case and make a recommendation about whether you should receive a pardon (see below under “Traditional or Direct Pardon”).[3108] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Traditional Or Direct Pardon (without Certificate of Rehabilitation)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you applied directly to the Governor for a Traditional Pardon, the Governor will review of your case to decide whether you deserve a pardon. The Governor may ask the judge of the court where you were convicted and the DA who prosecuted you for information about your case and recommendations about whether you should get a pardon.[3109] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In most cases, the Governor will also send your application to the Board of Parole Hearings for its recommendation about whether you deserve a pardon.[3110] The BPH may investigate your application by looking at documents and transcripts from your case, talking to witnesses, or doing anything else to evaluate your application. The BPH will then make a recommendation to the Governor about whether you should get a pardon.[3111] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    REMEMBER: If you were convicted of 2 or more felonies, the Governor MUST send your application to the Board of Parole Hearings for review, AND also CANNOT grant your pardon without getting a recommendation from the California Supreme Court. (However, the Governor does not have to send your application to the Supreme Court for review in the first place.)[3112] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BPH-Recommended Pardon 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the BPH recommends you for a pardon, it will conduct its own investigation of your case first, before making its recommendation to the Governor. If the BPH investigates your case, but decides NOT to recommend you for a pardon, it must tell you its reasons for not recommending you.[3113]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What happens if my pardon is granted? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What happens when the Governor grants your pardon is the same regardless of whether you received the pardon based on your Certificate of Rehabilitation, applied for a Traditional Pardon directly from the Governor, or were recommended for a pardon by the BPH. Here is the process: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Governor’s Office will notify the CA Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to update their records.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Governor will file your pardon with the CA Secretary of State and report it to the CA State Legislature.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The pardon will become a public record, along with your Certificate of Rehabilitation (if you received one) or your direct Application for Gubernatorial Pardon. (However, any sensitive personal information will remain confidential and hidden from the public.)[3114]
