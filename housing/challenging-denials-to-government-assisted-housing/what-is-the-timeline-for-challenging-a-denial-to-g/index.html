          <p class="textbox">In terms of timing, if you want to challenge a denial, you should request a “review hearing” <em>in writing</em> as soon as you receive notice of the denial. There are strict time deadlines for requesting a review hearing, and they are different for every housing program. You must stick to the deadline, so READ THE NOTICE of denial! You may have <em>as little as 1 week</em> (7 days) to request a review hearing! If you miss the deadline, you will not only lose the housing unit, but will also be taken off the waitlist and have to reapply. If you request a review hearing on time, the housing unit will be held for you until there is a final decision!</p>
