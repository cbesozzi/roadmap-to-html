  <p>
    What are common errors in RAP Sheets?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Someone else’s information. Your RAP sheet may contain criminal history information about someone else with the same (or a similar) name as you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Leaving out important information about a case. Your RAP sheet may leave out important information about the final outcome of your case. For example, your RAP sheet may still say “case pending” even AFTER you were acquitted or the charges were dropped.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Including sealed information. Your RAP may contain records that should have been destroyed or can only be released by special court order, such as sealed arrests or juvenile offenses.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Misleading information. It is possible that a single charge may appear multiple times on your RAP, making it look like you have multiple offenses when you only have one.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Misclassifying your offense. If a misdemeanor conviction shows up as a felony on your RAP sheet, this is a serious problem!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    HOw could these mistakes end up in my rap sheet?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Human error. The people who manage the various records can make mistakes. They may confuse you with someone who has a similar name, enter your information wrong, or include information that should NOT be included (for example, a sealed juvenile offense). Failure to confirm information: Although government agencies are supposed to confirm that the information that they have about you is correct and up-to-date, a lot of times they don’t. As a result, they may not report changes in the status of your case or the final outcome of the case, even if you were acquitted or the case was dismissed!Identity theft. Someone else may open an account using your personal information or commit a crime and pretend to be you by giving your name or identification. These activities may then go in your record as your actions!
