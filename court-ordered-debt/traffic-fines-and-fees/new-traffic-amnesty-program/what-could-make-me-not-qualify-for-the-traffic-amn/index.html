        <h1>What could make me NOT qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153551"></a>What could make me <em>NOT</em> qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?</h3>
        <p class="text">There are some tickets that <em>do not</em> qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2229" id="footnote-ref-2229">[2197]</a></sup></sup> For example, parking tickets,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2230" id="footnote-ref-2230">[2198]</a></sup></sup> DUIs,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2231" id="footnote-ref-2231">[2199]</a></sup></sup> and reckless driving tickets (like road-rage, speeding, racing, etc.),<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2232" id="footnote-ref-2232">[2200]</a></sup></sup> are NOT eligible for the Traffic Amnesty Program.</p>
        <p class="text">Additionally, you are not eligible to participate <em>if you owe restitution (money damages)</em> on any case in the county where the traffic violation was filed.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2233" id="footnote-ref-2233">[2201]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">You are also not eligible for the program <em>if you have any outstanding misdemeanor or felony warrants in the same county where the ticket(s) was issued.</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2234" id="footnote-ref-2234">[2202]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="importantbox"><em>IMPORTANT WARNING FOR PEOPLE WITH OPEN WARRANTS: </em>f there’s ANY possibility that you might have an outstanding warrant for your arrest—for ANY reason (including new charges against you or a failure to appear in court) from ANY county—it is recommended that you call the public defender or a private lawyer to check on your warrant status first, before trying to see if you are eligible for the Traffic Amnesty Program. </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153552"></a>What kind of help can I get through the Traffic Amnesty Program?<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2235" id="footnote-ref-2235">[2203]</a></sup></sup></strong> </h3>
        <p class="text"><em>&gt; You may be eligible to have BOTH your traffic court fines reduced on a ticket (by 50% or 80% depending on your income) AND get your CA driver license reinstated if . . .</em></p>
        <ol class="text">You have an unpaid ticket that is covered by the program, and your fines were originally due to be paid <em>on or before January 1, 2013</em>; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have not made any payment on your ticket <em>after September 30, 2015.</em></ol>
        <p class="text">PAYMENT PLAN OPTION:<em> </em>It is important to note that the amount your fines will be reduced <em>depends on your income</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2236" id="footnote-ref-2236">[2204]</a></sup></sup><em> </em>If you cannot afford to pay the full amount of the fine, even after the reduction, you can sign up for a <em>monthly payment plan option</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2237" id="footnote-ref-2237">[2205]</a></sup></sup> The payment plan will be based on your ability to pay the fine. If you receive public benefits or are very low-income, make sure to have written proof of this before applying! More information about payment plans will be posted to the California Courts’ website here: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/trafficamnesty.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/trafficamnesty.htm</a>.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>&gt; You may be able to just get your California driver license reinstated (but not reduce the fines you owe on a ticket) if . . .</em></p>
        <ol class="text">You sign up and comply with a payment plan (including paying any court fees, which can be added to your balance and paid over time through the payment plan); OR</ol>
        <ol class="text">You made a payment on your ticket <em>after September 30, 2015.</em><sup> <sup><a href="#footnote-2238" id="footnote-ref-2238">[2206]</a></sup></sup></ol>
