  <h3><a id="_Toc328831227"></a>What is a birth certificate, and why would I need it?</h3>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox">What if I was born in another country?</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">Whether or not you are a U.S. Citizen, if you were born outside the United States, you must check with the country in which you were born for the procedures to get your birth certificate (see PG. 39 for more information).If you were born out of the United States, but you are a U.S. citizen because one or both of your parents was a U.S. citizen, see PG. 39 on how to obtain your birth certificate.<strong> </strong></p>
  
  <p class="text">Your birth certificate is important because it proves your legal name, age, birthdate, and birthplace. If you were born in the United States, it also proves your U.S. citizenship. Having a copy of your birth certificate is necessary to get other key forms of ID.</p>
