          <h1>When should I apply for federal financial aid?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153846"></a>When should I apply for federal financial aid?</h3>
          <p class="text">The FAFSA must be filled out at the beginning of the year <em>in which you intend to start school</em>. It becomes available on January 1, and although technically there is no deadline, try to fill it out as soon as possible after that date. Each state and every individual school has its own deadline by which it must receive FAFSA information in order to include federal funds in the financial aid package that it offers you. </p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOREBEARANCE AND DEFERMENT?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">A forebearance is a request to stop payments completely for a year. All people whose loan payments are equal to or greater than 20 percent of their monthly income qualify for a forebearance. This means incarcerated individuals would likely qualify automatically.Deferment is similar to forebearance in that it stops payments for a year. Unlike forebearance, the loan continues to accrue interest during that period, which makes it more expensive in the longrun. Either option is better than defaulting.</p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you’re incarcerated, you should not fill out the FAFSA unless you know you are going to be released in time to attend school <em>that year</em>. FAFSA information is only good for one year. (Everyone who applies for federal student aid must complete a new FAFSA every year.) </p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153847"></a>I already have student loans, can my student loans be deferred while I am incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">Yes, you can have your loans deferred, but you must apply for a deferment. </p>
          <p class="text">Deferment is a process that permits your to temporarily put your loan payments on hold for up to three years, depending on your loan provider and circumstances. </p>
          <p class="text">If you have: Federal Perkins Loans then contact the school that made your loan or the school’s servicing agent. </p>
          <p class="text">If you have: Direct Loans or Direct PLUS Loans then contact the Direct Loan Servicing Center at 1-800-848-0979 or online at <a href="http://www.dl.ed.gov">www.dl.ed.gov</a>.</p>
          <p class="text">If you have FFEL Loans (includes FFEL PLUS Loans) then contact the lender or agency holding your loan. For the phone number of the agency in your state, contact FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID.<sup><a href="#footnote-2866" id="footnote-ref-2866">[2832]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
          <p class="text">If you cannot get in touch with your student loan provider then we suggest asking someone on the outside to send you the necessary forms for deferment from your loan provider. Also, we suggest asking your case manager for proof of your incarceration so you can provide that to the loan providers along with the other paperwork. For more information on deferring your student loans while incarcerated, please write Root &amp; Rebound anytime or call us on our hotline every Friday from 9AM to 5PM PST. </p>
          <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you took out student loans so that you could attend WyoTech, Everest College, or Heald College, you may be able to discharge any associated student loan debt. Following the closure of all 28 Heald, Everest, and WyoTech campuses in California, the Departent of Education created a expedited process for former students of these schools to discharge their debt based on defense to repayment.

          <h3>I WAS RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED, MY loans went into default. what can I DO? </h3>
          <p class="text">Start by calling your federal loan provider. A representative may be able to talk through your options. Most likely, you will have to rehabilitate your loan, which requires you to make nine consecutive monthly payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2867" id="footnote-ref-2867">[2833]</a></sup> If you are currently incarcerated, that payment may be as low as $5.<sup><a href="#footnote-2868" id="footnote-ref-2868">[2834]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">Once you have successfully rehabilitated your loan, you can apply for an income-driven repayment plan, which lets you pay off your loans using a portion of your income. If you are currently incarcerated, you may not have any monthly payments at all.<sup><a href="#footnote-2869" id="footnote-ref-2869">[2835]</a></sup></p>
