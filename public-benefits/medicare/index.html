<h1>Medicare</h1>

<p>
  Medicare
</p>

<p>
  Medicare is a federal health care program for people who are elderly and people who have disabilities. Medicare benefits are grouped into four parts: Part A covers hospital care; Part B covers outpatient services; Part C covers services offered by private insurance plans; and Part D covers prescription drugs. There are two main ways to get your Medicare coverage: (1) Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) OR (2) a Part C Medicare Advantage Plan. Some people get additional coverage, such as optional prescription drug coverage through Part D. 
</p>

<p>
  Can my criminal history limit my ability to get Medicare? 
</p>

<p>
  No! There are no eligibility restrictions based on past convictions or violations. 
</p>

<p>
  Am I eligible for Medicare? 
</p>

<p>
  When you apply for Medicare, you have to consider whether you will eligible to enroll in each part Parts A and B (and possibly D) or Part C (and possibly D). This is because each Part has difference requirements and rules, and your incarceration affects each Part differently.[1476] 
</p>

<p>
  APPLY TO MEDICARE BEFORE YOU TURN 65! 
</p>

<p>
  You can start getting Medicare when you turn 65. However, you can enroll up to 3 months before you turn 65. To confirm whether you qualify and to learn which Parts/Plans are right for you, call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re a citizen of the U.S., or you’ve been a legal resident for 5+ years, you may qualify for Medicare if:
</p>

<p>
  You’re age 65 or older, and you or your spouse has worked and paid into Medicare for 10+ years; or
</p>

<p>
  You have a disability that qualifies you for Social Security Disability benefits (no matter how old you are); or
</p>

<p>
  You have permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant.[1477]
</p>

<p>
  What benefits and services can I get through Medicare? 
</p>

<p>
  Medicare covers services and supplies that are medically necessary to treat a disease or condition.[1478] 
</p>

<p>
  ORIGINAL MEDICARE (Part A and Part B): Part A covers hospital insurance,[1479] and Part B covers medical insurance.[1480] 
</p>

<p>
  Part A Hospital Insurance covers:
</p>

<p>
  Hospital care;
</p>

<p>
  Nursing care;
</p>

<p>
  Nursing home care;
</p>

<p>
  Hospice; and 
</p>

<p>
  Home health services.[1481] 
</p>

<p>
  Part B Medical Insurance covers:
</p>

<p>
  Medically necessary services (services that are needed to diagnose or treat a medical condition); and 
</p>

<p>
  Preventative services (heath care to detect or prevent illness).[1482] 
</p>

<p>
  You have your choice of doctors, hospitals, and other providers that accept Medicare. You pay a monthly premium for Part B, and you may pay no or very low premiums for Part A (depending on your employment history).[1483] Note: Part B is optional. When you enroll in Part A, you can choose whether to get Part B. If you’re on Social Security benefits, Part B premiums will get deducted from your Social Security checks; otherwise, you’ll get billed for Part B premiums.[1484]
</p>

<p>
  MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN (Part C): Part C plans include hospital and medical insurance (Parts A and B). Private insurance companies, approved by Medicare, provide this coverage. You choose a Part C plan, and then you must use doctors, hospitals or other providers listed in that plan (or else pay higher costs). You pay an extra premium for getting Part C, in addition to whatever it would cost you to be enrolled in Parts A and B (through Original Medicare).[1485]
</p>

<p>
  MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN (Part D): Part D provides prescription drug insurance for anyone enrolled in Medicare. You choose a Part D plan, and it works as an addition to your Original Medicare (Parts A and B)—or your Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C). PLEASE NOTE: Part D is optional. When you enroll in Medicare, you can choose whether to get Part D. If you have low income, you can get extra help paying for Part D.[1486] 
</p>
