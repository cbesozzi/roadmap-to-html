        <h1>Why do I need to know my SSN?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc328831253"></a>Why do I need to know my SSN?</h3>
        <p class="text">Like your birth certificate, your SSN proves who you are. You’ll need to provide your 9-digit SSN to access government services and to apply for jobs, public benefits, housing, a driver license, health care, education programs, and financial aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-41" id="footnote-ref-41">[41]</a></sup> </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc328831254"></a>I have a SSN, but I forgot it or never knew it. How do I find out what it is?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-42" id="footnote-ref-42">[42]</a></sup></strong> </h3>
        <p class="text">If you were assigned a SSN at some point in your life, but you don’t know it now, you need to request a <em>replacement card</em>. This is the only way to get your number because the Social Security Administration (SSA) does not give out Social Security numbers any other way. You can apply for a replacement card by mail or in person at a local SSA Field Office. For more information on getting a replacement card, see PG. 42 if you’re incarcerated, or PG. 44 if you’re out.</p>
