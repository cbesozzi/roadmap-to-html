  <p>
    I am on supervised release, and I’m trying to move in with someone I know. If my family member or the person who I want to move in with lives in government-assisted housing (like public housing, section 8, or a voucher program), can I still move in?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. If the family member or person you want to move in with lives in subsidized housing, there might be federal, state, or local laws that restrict someone on federal probation or Supervised Release from moving into the residence. It may depend on what your conviction was for. To avoid putting that person’s government- assisted housing subsidy at risk, refer to the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 368, to learn more about how your criminal record or supervision status might affect where you can live.

  <p>
    Can I get OFF SUPERVISED RELEASE EARLY?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possibly. After you have completed one year of supervision, the court can terminate your supervised release where appropriate.[852] In making this decision, judges should consider your particular circumstances, and will examine your conduct throughout the period of supervision.[853] The court has the authority to terminate supervised release early, even if you were convicted of a statute that requires a specific term.[854]

    Violations and Revocations — For Both Federal Probation and Supervised Release
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The same rules and processes for violations and revocations apply to both federal probation and Supervised Release.[855]Read this section if you are on either of these two types of federal supervision and have questions about violations and revocations.
