  <p>
    What are common errors in a background check?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Information that should NOT be included—such as convictions more than 7 years old, arrests that did not lead to a conviction (unless charges are still pending), participation in court-ordered drug treatment, or convictions that have been dismissed;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Information that is wrong (for example, reporting that you were convicted of robbery instead of petty theft);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Information that belongs to someone else with the same (or a similar) name as you;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Report of an arrest or charges filed, but not the final outcome of the case (for example, you were never charged, charges were dismissed, you were acquitted, or you plead guilty to a lesser offense);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Information from public records or personal interviews that has not been confirmed;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any negative information about you that is more than 7 years old (or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have the right to challenge any information in your background check, and to view the background check company’s files containing any information that was used to prepare your background check.
