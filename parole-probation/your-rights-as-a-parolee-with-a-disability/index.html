<h1>Your Rights as a Parolee with a Disability</h1>

<p>
  Your Rights as a Parolee with a Disability
</p>

<p>
  I have a disability. do I have THE RIGHT to get accommodations for my disability while I am on parole?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California state law[532] protect you from discrimination due to your disabilities.[533] There are specific rules and procedures that govern your rights while you are in prison or on parole in California:
</p>

<p>
  PRACTICAL TIP IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED, PREPARING FOR RELEASE, AND requirE A device for YOUR disability:
</p>

<p>
  The prison staff may fail to give you the device you need for your disability when you are released. If this happens to you, inform your parole agent immediately and file a disability-related appeal on CDCR Form 1824 (read more about this special appeals process on PG. 199). 
</p>

<p>
  The rules for individuals with physical disabilities (such as mobility, hearing, and vision disabilities) and learning disabilities are in the Armstrong Remedial Plan (January 3, 2001, amended December 1, 2010), § IV.S.
</p>

<p>
  The rules for individuals with developmental disabilities are in the Clark Remedial Plan (March 1, 2002), § VIII.
</p>

<p>
  How will my parole agent know about my disability and my related special needs?
</p>

<p>
  Your correctional counselor in the prison is required to notify your parole agent about your disability and related special needs. Your correctional counselor should do this by providing information on CDCR Form 611, “Release Program Study” (RPS) (see a copy of this form in Appendix S, PG. 330) and additional specific forms that explain the accommodations you need. If you have a physical discability, your correctional counselor should use CDCR Form 1845 (see example in Appendix T, PG. 336); and if you have a developmental disability, your correctional counselor should use CDCR Form 128C-2 (see example in Appendix U, PG. 339). If you see that the information about your disability is not on your Form 611 RPS, tell your correctional counselor (if you’re still incarcerated) or your parole agent (if you’re out). If, after you talk to your correctional counselor or parole agent, your disability is still not being recorded or accommodated, file an appeal. The appeal process is explained on PG. 199.
</p>

<p>
  In general, What accommodations must Parole make for people with disabilities?
</p>

<p>
  If you are a person with a disability, parole staff must make the following accommodations:
</p>

<p>
  First, parole staff must make sure that you receive “effective communication” during all orientations, interviews, and supervision meetings, and when you are notified of conditions of parole and registration requirements. This means parole staff must provide any help necessary for you to understand the information being communicated. Examples include: [534]
</p>

<p>
  Assistance by a sign language interpreter for a hearing- impaired person;
</p>

<p>
  Reading aloud of written materials for a vision-impaired person; or
</p>

<p>
  Simplifying information for a developmentally disabled person.
</p>

<p>
  Second, parole staff must make reasonable changes to procedures so that you can receive services in a location that is accessible to you. For example:
</p>

<p>
  If a disability makes it difficult for you to get to the parole office, the parole agent should meet you somewhere else, such as at your home.
</p>

<p>
  If the parole agent refers you to community service such as a drug treatment center, a job center, or a literacy center, the parole staff should make sure that you can actually get to the programs and services offered.
</p>

<p>
  If you are required to attend a program at the parole office (such as an outpatient clinic), that program must be accessible considering your special needs.
</p>

<p>
  Third, if, while you are in prison, you are using a wheelchair or other healthcare appliance (such as a cane, prosthesis, eyeglasses, or prosthetic eyes), you have the legal right to keep the device when you leave prison, even if the state provided you with the device.
</p>

<p>
  Fourth, if parole staff is transporting you somewhere, parole staff must consider all of your disability needs in deciding what mode of transportation to use. 
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, if parole staff arrests you while you are on parole, they must take your disability into account in deciding whether or how to put physical restraints on you. For example:
</p>

<p>
  If you need to use a cane, the parole agent should not cuff you behind your back.
</p>

<p>
  parole is not accommodating my disability, and I am not getting fair treatment or equal access to parole services or programs. what can I do?
</p>

<p>
  If you are a person with a disability asking for fair treatment or asking for access to parole services or programs, there is a special CDCR appeals process for you. Follow these steps:[535]
</p>

<p>
  STEP 1: Fill out CDCR Form 1824, “Request for Modification or Reasonable Accommodation” (a yellow form, see Appendix Q, PG. 327). If you cannot fill out the form due to your disability, seek help from your parole agent, an advocate, or a friend or family member. All parole offices should have this form. You do not need to request an informal review through Form 22 before filing a Form 1824 (unlike with a 602 appeal). 
</p>

<p>
  STEP 2: If you get a first level response from Parole denying your request, you can appeal to the second level by attaching the original CDCR Form 1824 (find a sample copy in Appendix Q, PG. 327) to a regular CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal (find a sample copy in Appendix J, PG. 311), with Section F of CDCR Form 602 filled out. Send both forms to the Regional Parole Administrator (see Appendix D, PG. 311 for the contact information). 
</p>

<p>
  STEP 3: If you get a second level response denying your request, you can send the appeal to the third level for review. 
</p>

<p>
  STEP 4: If you get a third level response denying your request, that means you have “exhausted” (completed) all three levels of the 1824 disability appeals process, and you can bring the issue to court by filing a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the superior court of the county of your parole. See Appendix K, PG. 314 to learn how. Find the necessary forms online here: http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/BOPH/Inmates_w_Disabilities_Resource.html.
</p>

<p>
  during a parole revocation hearing, Do I have rights to accommodations for my disability?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you have a right to reasonable accommodations for your disability during parole violation/revocation proceedings.[536] For example, parole staff must:
</p>

<p>
  Ensure access to the hearing room if you are a parolee with mobility impairments;
</p>

<p>
  Provide Braille, taped documents, or reading assistance if you are a vision-impaired parolee;
</p>

<p>
  Provide assistance in communicating if you are a developmentally disabled parolee; 
</p>

<p>
  Provide sign language interpretation if you are a hearing-impaired parolee.[537]
</p>

<p>
  In addition, parole staff must always use “effective communication” and provide reasonable accommodations when interacting with you — even when they are:
</p>

<p>
  Arresting you;
</p>

<p>
  Modifying your parole conditions; or 
</p>

<p>
  Imposing sanctions like flash incarceration.[538] 
</p>

<p>
  When revocation proceedings begin, parole staff should alert jail staff and the attorney appointed to you about your special needs.[539] In the courtroom, your attorney and the court should be responsible for ensuring your needs are met throughout the court process.[540]
</p>

<p>
  KEEP IN MIND:
</p>

<p>
  If you are a disabled parolee who is having problems receiving help from parole staff, you can submit a CDCR Form 1824, “Request for Modification or Reasonable Accommodation,” (read about this process on PG. 199 above).
