        <h3><a id="_Toc448153422"></a>What can I do if there is inaccurate, incomplete, or illegal information in my background check report?</h3>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf I did not receive a Pre-Adverse Action or Adverse Action Notice, how can I show that the employer rejected me based on my background check and NOT other reasons?</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Here are 2 strategies that have been used for showing that the employer may have rejected you based on your background check, even if they did NOT give you a Pre-Adverse Action or Adverse Action Notice:</p>
        <div class="textboxnumber">Did the employer say they would run a background check on you—either in person, on the job posting, or on the job application? Did the employer give you a Notice saying they would run a background check, or have you sign a document giving them permission to run a background check? Did the employer give you a Pre-Adverse Action Notice but NOT Adverse Action Notice (or the opposite—an Adverse Action Notice but NOT Pre-Adverse Action Notice)? Did the employer say anything about your record, or about (not) hiring people with criminal records? Any of these can help show that the employer did run a background check on you, and may have rejected your application based on information in your background check.If you feel comfortable, you can try talking to the employer directly. You can explain that you are trying to improve your application for the future, and then ask why the employer did not select your application and what you can do to improve your chances in the future.In some cases, the employer may say something that reveals he/she made a decision based on your record or other information in your background check—for example, a negative comment about your being trustworthy, creating a risk to others, or about people with criminal records, in general. If this happens, make sure that you write down afterward exactly what the employer said!In other cases, the employer may actually give you a helpful explanation that really can help you to improve your job applications in the future. This may show that the employer really did have some other reason for not hiring you, or at the very least can give you help you to be more successful for future jobs.Finally, the employer may not give you any explanation for their decision, or may simply say that other people were more qualified or applied before you. In this case, it may be difficult to show that the employer actually rejected you based on your background check report. </div>
        <p class="text">You have the right to dispute (challenge) any inaccurate, incomplete, or illegally included information in your background check report. </p>
        <p class="text">If there is inaccurate, incomplete, or illegal information in your background check report, you have the right to dispute (challenge) this information with the background check company that prepared the report. The background check company must investigate the error, delete or correct any improper information, and send a notice and a statement of correction to ANY employer who received a copy of your background check in the past 2 years (or anyone else who received a copy of your background check in the past year) if you ask.<sup><a href="#footnote-1828" id="footnote-ref-1828">[1798]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">For more information on how to dispute inaccurate, incomplete, or illegally included information in your background check report, see information below, or see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132.</p>
