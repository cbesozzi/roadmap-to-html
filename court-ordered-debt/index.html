<p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="text">Many people coming home from prison or jail are surprised to find that they owe lots of money to various courts, agencies, and people. The money you owe can make it very hard to get back on your feet, which can leave you feeling frustrated and discouraged. Unfortunately, this Chapter includes a lot of BAD NEWS about court-ordered debt because most of the laws that control court-ordered debt are NOT in your favor. However, reentry advocates—and even some politicians— who realize that this kind of debt harms not only formerly incarcerated people who are trying to start over, but also the communities they are returning to, are working to change these laws. In the meantime, this Chapter will give you some important information to help you better understand your rights, responsibilities, and opportunities when it comes to managing money that you owe due to your past court involvement (referred to in the rest of the Chapter as “court-ordered debt”).</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153497"></a>What is court-ordered debt and why do I need to know about it? </h3>
<p class="text">Court-ordered debt is money that you may owe because of some involvement you had with the criminal justice system—whether you were convicted, acquitted, your charges were dismissed, or you were only ever arrested. You may owe this money to the <em>court</em> itself, to the <em>county</em> or other <em>government agency</em>, to a <em>victim</em> of your crime, or even to a <em>collection agency</em>. If you were convicted of a crime, you most likely owe court-related costs, or owed them at one point. But <em>even if you were never convicted</em> of anything, the court can still make you pay other fees, such as jail booking fees, public defender fees, and fees associated with minor offenses called infractions. It is important that you know about and understand any court-ordered debt you owe, because this debt can make it difficult for you to move forward with your life in many different ways. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153498"></a>I’ve never received anything telling me that I owe money; so I must not have any court-ordered debt, right? </h3>
<p class="text">Absolutely not! People move; paperwork gets lost in the mail; and addresses get written down incorrectly all the time. Just because you haven’t heard anything, doesn’t mean that you’re in the clear. Remember, if you have had any involvement with the criminal justice system, <em>especially if you have a conviction</em>, you were most likely ordered to pay money of some kind at some point. If you don’t take steps to find out about and take care of your debt, there could be serious consequences. Even if you are 100% positive that you have paid off your debt entirely, mistakes can be made. Your payments may not have been properly recorded, or your name could be attached to someone else’s debt! It is better to check and be safe than to assume and be sorry. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153499"></a>What are the different types of court ordered debt? </h3>
<p class="text">There are three main types of court-ordered debt: (1) restitution; (2) fines and penalties; and (3) administrative fees. (You may also have debt from unpaid traffic fines and tickets. These are discussed later in this Chapter, on PG. 732). It can be hard to keep track of the different types of debt; this chart gives an overview of the important information about each one.</p>

<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE NAMES &amp; PURPOSES OF COURT-ORDERED DEBTS: The names for different types of court-ordered debt can be confusing. The chart above tries to explain the four basic types of court-ordered debt, but the names you see on your actual court paperwork and “sentencing order” may be different. For example, sometimes the same word (for example, “fee” or “assessment”) is used to mean <em>different things </em>by <em>different courts in different counties</em>. If you have any questions about your court-ordered debts and what they mean, ask your public defender or the lawyer who represented you in your case.Because each type of court-ordered debt has a different purpose, you will probably owe many different types of debt (restitution, fines, and fees) even if you have only one conviction. If you have more than one conviction, you will likely owe separate sets of court-ordered debt for each conviction. </p>
<h2><a id="_Toc448153500"></a>A Basic Overview of Court-Ordered DebT RESTITUTION</h2>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153501"></a>Restitution</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153502"></a>What is restitution?</h3>
<p class="text">Restitution is money that you are ordered to pay to <em>victims</em> and to the <em>state</em> if you are convicted of a crime. Restitution is intended to repay the victims for the harm they suffered, and to repay your debt to society. Judges are <em>required</em> to order restitution if you are convicted of a crime, regardless of whether you can afford to pay. Restitution is the most serious type of court-ordered debt and the hardest to get rid of.<sup><a href="#footnote-2014" id="footnote-ref-2014">[2014]</a></sup> </p>
<h4 class="textbox"><strong>TYPES OF RESTITUTION:</strong></h4>
<p class="textbox">To make things even more complicated, there are different types of restitution—each with a different purpose. The three main types of restitution are: <em>(1) VICTIM RESTITUTION</em> (also called <em>Direct Orders of Restitution</em>): Victim restitution goes to the <em>victim(s)</em> of your crime to <em>repay any harm </em>caused <em>or losses</em> suffered because of your actions. If your crime involved injury to a <em>person</em>, <em>property damage,</em> or <em>economic loss</em>, you will have to pay victim restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2015" id="footnote-ref-2015">[2015]</a></sup> Usually the court orders victim restitution at the time of <em>sentencing</em>, however, the court can order it <em>at any time</em> afterward, if needed.<sup><a href="#footnote-2016" id="footnote-ref-2016">[2016]</a></sup> This means that even if the judge did NOT order victim restitution when you were sentenced, he or she can still order it later—and you will still have to pay it! <em>(2) RESTITUTION FINES</em>: Restitution fines go to <em>the state</em> to <em>repay your debt to society</em>. <em>Everyone </em>who is convicted of a crime MUST pay a restitution fine, so if you have a conviction—regardless of whether it was a misdemeanor or a felony—you have to pay a restitution fine.<sup><a href="#footnote-2017" id="footnote-ref-2017">[2017]</a></sup>In some situations, even if you were never convicted, you may still have to pay a restitution fine. For example, if your case was dismissed because you successfully completed a diversion program (i.e. drug treatment or anger management) or you received a deferred entry of judgment (DEJ), you will still be ordered to pay a restitution fine.<sup><a href="#footnote-2018" id="footnote-ref-2018">[2018]</a></sup> Also, if some of your charges were dismissed as part of a plea bargain, you still may have to pay restitution on the dismissed charges!<sup><a href="#footnote-2019" id="footnote-ref-2019">[2019]</a></sup><em>(3) REVOCATION RESTITUTION FINES</em>: If you are sentenced to <em>any type of supervision</em> (parole, mandatory supervision, Post Release Community Supervision, or probation), the court will impose a revocation restitution fine. However, this fine is suspended unless you violate the conditions of your supervision and your supervision is revoked. This means you do not have to pay this fine unless your supervision is<em> revoked</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2020" id="footnote-ref-2020">[2020]</a></sup></p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT VICTIM RESTITUTION: Victim restitution never goes away. It is not discharged in bankruptcy,<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2021" id="footnote-ref-2021">[2021]</a></sup></strong> and you will continue to owe any unpaid victim restitution even after you have completed your sentence and term of supervision. The court will ALMOST NEVER waive or excuse your restitution, or let you do community service instead of paying. Unless the court finds “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to let you out of your restitution obligation, the only way to get rid of victim restitution is to pay it off. Unfortunately, the fact that you can’t afford to pay it off is not an “extraordinary and compelling reason!”<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2022" id="footnote-ref-2022">[2022]</a></sup></strong></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153503"></a>Is it possible to owe more than one type of restitution? </h3>
<p class="text">Yes. In fact, it is likely that you owe more than one type of restitution. Almost everyone with a conviction will owe victim restitution. Most people will owe BOTH victim restitution AND restitution fines.<sup><a href="#footnote-2023" id="footnote-ref-2023">[2023]</a></sup> Anyone whose supervision was permanently revoked may owe all three types of restitution. Also, if you have convictions from more than one case, the court can order all three types of restitution in each case.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2024" id="footnote-ref-2024">[2024]</a></sup></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153504"></a>Who is considered a “victim” to recover victim restitution?</h3>
<p class="text">The law defines “victim” VERY broadly. Even if no one was physically hurt during the crime, the court can order you to pay for property damage or economic losses caused by the crime. You could be ordered to pay restitution to ANY of the following:</p>
<ol class="text">A specific person (or people) who suffered physical or emotional harm, had property taken or damaged, or had to pay out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the crime;The family of the person harmed;The Victim Compensation &amp; Government Claims Board (Restitution Fund);A business that was damaged or had money losses due the crime; and/orA government agency that was damaged or had money losses, suffered vandalism damage, or had to clean or repair graffiti caused by the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-2025" id="footnote-ref-2025">[2025]</a></sup> </ol>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153505"></a>Court fines and penalties</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153506"></a><a id="COD_CourtFinesPenalties_defined"></a>What are court fines and penalties? </h3>
<p class="text">Court fines and penalties are money you must pay as part of your <em>punishment</em> for your conviction, in addition to the rest of your sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2026" id="footnote-ref-2026">[2026]</a> </sup>The amount you have to pay will depend on the <em>specific offense(s)</em> you were convicted of, and the total amount you owe for <em>other fines</em>. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You may be charged multiple sets of fines and penalties for the same conviction, because the state and county can each fine you separately for the offense.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2027" id="footnote-ref-2027">[2027]</a></sup></strong></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153507"></a>What should I know about court fines and penalties?</h3>
<ol class="text">Some fines and penalties can be ordered as <em>conditions of your probation</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2028" id="footnote-ref-2028">[2028]</a></sup> (See PG. 729 for fines and penalties that are conditions of your probation.)Some fines and penalties are determined based on your <em>ability to pay</em>, which means the court must find that you can <em>afford to pay the fine</em> BEFORE imposing them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2029" id="footnote-ref-2029">[2029]</a></sup> Others are imposed regardless of your ability to pay.<sup><a href="#footnote-2030" id="footnote-ref-2030">[2030]</a></sup></ol>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153508"></a>Court administrative fees</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153509"></a><a id="COD_CourtAdminFees_defined"></a>What are court administrative fees? </h3>
<p class="text">Administrative fees are money you pay to the courts, county, and other agencies to cover the day-to-day costs of running the courts and criminal justice system. Administrative fees are used to pay for things like court security, probation supervision, public defender fees, jail time, and debt collection.<sup><a href="#footnote-2031" id="footnote-ref-2031">[2031]</a></sup> Some fees are imposed by the court; other fees are imposed by the county or by other agencies.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153510"></a>What should I know about court administrative fees? </h3>
<ol class="text">Administrative fees generally CANNOT be conditions of probation, because they are NOT intended as punishment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2032" id="footnote-ref-2032">[2032]</a></sup> One exception to this rule is the Criminal Justice Administration Fee (sometimes referred to as the jail booking fee), which CAN be a condition of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2033" id="footnote-ref-2033">[2033]</a></sup>Most administrative fees are imposed only if you are able to pay them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2034" id="footnote-ref-2034">[2034]</a></sup> Often, these fees can be waived.<sup><a href="#footnote-2035" id="footnote-ref-2035">[2035]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153511"></a>What happens to my court-ordered debt while I’m incarcerated?</h3>
<p class="text">Your debts CAN increase while you’re inside—but WHETHER they do and by HOW MUCH will depend on different things, such as: how old the debt is, whether it has been sent to collections, the amount of victim restitution you owe, and whether you’ve been making restitution payments. Some reasons your debt may increase while you’re incarcerated are:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">What is “DELINQUENT DEBT”?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you have missed one or more payments, your debt is “overdue” or “delinquent.” Usually, you will get a letter notifying you that your debt has become delinquent, and you will have a limited time to make a payment or reestablish an installment plan before extra punishments and fines are imposed.</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">What are “COLLECTION AGENCIES”?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">When courts (or anyone else) can’t get a person to pay their debt on time, they often will hire a “collection agency” to try to get back the money owed. Collection agencies track down the person who owes (the “debtor”), and tries to get them to pay. If they are successful in collecting the debt, the collection agency receives a percentage of the payment. </p>
<ol class="text">You can be charged interest and administrative fees on your restitution debts.<sup><a href="#footnote-2036" id="footnote-ref-2036">[2036]</a></sup> NOTE: If you are paying restitution through your facility while incarcerated, you may be charged administrative fees for any payments you make.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2037" id="footnote-ref-2037">[2037]</a></sup> If CDCR or a county agency is automatically taking restitution payments directly from your prison or jail account, you may not even realize you’re being charged extra. (See PG. 744 for more information about paying restitution while you’re incarcerated.)If your debt is <em>delinquent</em>, you may be charged a $300 penalty (called a “civil assessment”) for late payments or non-payment. NOTE: If you were unable to pay the debt <em>because</em> you were incarcerated, you may be able to ask the court to forgive (“vacate”) the penalty.<sup><a href="#footnote-2038" id="footnote-ref-2038">[2038]</a></sup> (See PG. 746 for information on vacating civil assessment charges.)If your debt has been sent to “collections” (see explanation in side box) you may be charged an extra administrative fee to cover the costs of transferring your debt to the collection agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2039" id="footnote-ref-2039">[2039]</a></sup>You may be charged for failures to appear in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2040" id="footnote-ref-2040">[2040]</a></sup>You may be charged a fee if your driver license was suspended due to unpaid court debts.<sup><a href="#footnote-2041" id="footnote-ref-2041">[2041]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153512"></a>Will my debts be sent to “collections”? </h3>
<p class="text">Maybe. The more <em>delinquent</em> your debt is, the more likely that it will be, or already has been, sent to collections. Each court, county, and agency handles unpaid debts differently. The court may start by trying to collect the debt itself. Once the debt becomes overdue, courts often send unpaid debts to the county collection agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2042" id="footnote-ref-2042">[2042]</a></sup> If the debt remains unpaid, the court or county collection agency may then send your debt to a private collection agency or to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), which acts as a collections agency for the state and for CDCR.<sup><a href="#footnote-2043" id="footnote-ref-2043">[2043]</a></sup> For more information on tracking down your debt, see PG. 742. For more information on what to do if your court-ordered debt HAS BEEN sent to collections, see PG. 741.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153513"></a>How can my court-ordered debt affect me while I am on a term of supervision?</h3>
<p class="text">If you are under any type of supervision—parole, mandatory supervision, Post-Release Community Supervision, or probation—it is very important to know which debts are conditions of that supervision, and to pay them first, if possible. In general, making restitution payments will ALWAYS be a condition of your supervision.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2044" id="footnote-ref-2044">[2044]</a></sup> Other fines and fees can also be ordered as conditions of supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-2045" id="footnote-ref-2045">[2045]</a></sup> You can find out exactly which payments the court considers conditions of your probation by asking your parole or probation officer for a copy of your supervision order. You (or your attorney) can also go to the court and ask the clerk for a copy of the records (the “minutes”) from your sentencing. If you don’t pay the debts that are conditions of your supervision: (1) the court can <em>extend</em> the term of your supervision to the maximum time allowed,<sup><a href="#footnote-2046" id="footnote-ref-2046">[2046]</a></sup> or (2) the court may order you to do community service to satisfy your remaining fines and fees, or (3) the court may determine that you have violated your supervision and re-incarcerate you. If you are on probation and you complete your probation term, but you haven’t paid off all the restitution and fines that are conditions of your probation, the court may find that you <em>did NOT successfully complete probation</em>. This can make it harder to get your conviction dismissed later under California’s expungement statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-2047" id="footnote-ref-2047">[2047]</a></sup> However, due to a recent court decision, you cannot be denied mandatory expungement because you still owe victim restitution. See PG. 1062 for more information on mandatory and expungement and victim restitution. Here are other ways that owing unpaid restitution and other fines can affect you while you are on supervision:</p>
<ol class="text">It can be harder to transfer to another county, and you will NOT be allowed to transfer out of state.<sup><a href="#footnote-2048" id="footnote-ref-2048">[2048]</a></sup> If you want to get discharged early, it is very important to make reasonable restitution payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2049" id="footnote-ref-2049">[2049]</a></sup>Even if you successfully complete your supervision and are discharged, you will continue to owe any unpaid restitution (and all other debts that the court does not discharge).<sup><a href="#footnote-2050" id="footnote-ref-2050">[2050]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT!—If you are UNDER ANY KIND OF SUPERVISION: <em>It is very important to know which debts are conditions of that supervision—and to pay them first, if possible.</em> In general, making <em>restitution</em> payments will ALWAYS be a condition of your supervision.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2051" id="footnote-ref-2051">[2051]</a></sup></strong> <em>Other fines and fees</em> can also be ordered as conditions of supervision.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2052" id="footnote-ref-2052">[2052]</a></sup></strong> You can find out exactly which payments the court considers conditions of your probation by asking your parole or probation officer for a copy of your supervision order. You (or your attorney) can also go to the court and ask the clerk for a copy of the records (the “minutes”) from your sentencing. If you don’t pay the debts that are conditions of your supervision, (1) the court can <em>extend</em> the term of your supervision to the maximum time allowed (for probation) to give you more time to make payments,<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2053" id="footnote-ref-2053">[2053]</a></sup></strong> or (2) the court may order you to do community service to satisfy your remaining fines and fees, or (3) the court may determine that you have violated your supervision and re-incarcerate you. If you are on probation and you complete your probation term, a court may decide that you <em>did NOT successfully complete probation</em> if you haven’t paid of your restitution and fines. This can make it harder to get your conviction dismissed later under California’s expungement statute.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2054" id="footnote-ref-2054">[2054]</a></sup></strong> However, due to a recent court case in California, <em>a judge cannot deny you a mandatory dismissal just because you still owe victim restitution</em>. See PG. 1062 for more information on victim restitution and mandatory expungement.</p>

<h3>Which types of court-ordered debt are likely to be conditions of my probation?</h3>
<p class="textbox"><em>Restitution</em>—Making restitution payments will almost ALWAYS be a condition of your probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2055" id="footnote-ref-2055">[2055]</a></sup><em>Other Fines &amp; Penalties—</em>Some other fines and penalties may also be conditions of your probation. However, each type of fine and fee is different, so you will need to check your specific sentencing order to see which payments are conditions of your probation. Fines and fees that are always (or almost always) conditions of your probation:</p>
<ul class="textbox">Victim restitution +10% interest;<sup><a href="#footnote-2056" id="footnote-ref-2056">[2056]</a></sup>Restitution fine +10% administrative fee;Fine and penalty assessment (amount based on your conviction offense);Criminal Justice Administration Fee (jail booking fee).<sup><a href="#footnote-2057" id="footnote-ref-2057">[2057]</a></sup> </ul>
<p class="textbox">Fines that <em>may</em> be conditions of your probation, depending on your conviction offense:</p>
<ul class="textbox">Domestic Violence Fund Payment;<sup><a href="#footnote-2058" id="footnote-ref-2058">[2058]</a></sup>Alcohol Abuse Education &amp; Prevention Penalty Assessment;<sup><a href="#footnote-2059" id="footnote-ref-2059">[2059]</a></sup> Emergency Response Cost Restitution;<sup><a href="#footnote-2060" id="footnote-ref-2060">[2060]</a></sup>Hate Crime Restitution;<sup><a href="#footnote-2061" id="footnote-ref-2061">[2061]</a></sup>Abduction Restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2062" id="footnote-ref-2062">[2062]</a></sup></ul>
<p class="textbox"><em>Administrative Fees—</em>In general, administrative fees CANNOT be conditions of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2063" id="footnote-ref-2063">[2063]</a></sup> This includes things like court security fees, probation supervision costs, and attorney fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2064" id="footnote-ref-2064">[2064]</a></sup> However, one exception to this rule is the Criminal Justice Administration Fee (sometimes referred to as the jail booking fee), which CAN be a condition of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2065" id="footnote-ref-2065">[2065]</a></sup></p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: These are only some examples. YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR SENTENCING ORDER TO SEE WHICH FINES AND FEES ARE CONDITIONS OF YOUR PROBATION.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153515"></a>What happens if I don't pay off these debts?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends. Different types of debts have different consequences if you don’t pay them off. The consequences are also affected by the amount of debt you owe, how old the debt is, and which agency is trying to collect from you (for example, whether your debt is still with the court, with county collections, with a private collection agency, or with the Franchise Tax Board). In the previous section we explained what can happen if you don’t pay debts that are conditions of your supervision. This section will explain some of the <em>other</em> consequences you may face if you don’t pay off your court-ordered debts (whether you are on supervision or not).</p>
<h4><a id="COD_DebtCollection_ifnopayment"></a>Debt Collection:</h4>
<p class="text">If you owe unpaid restitution, fines, or court fees, the people or agencies that you owe (i.e. the victim, the victim’s family, the Victim Compensation Board, the Franchise Tax Board, private collection agencies) can try to collect the unpaid debt in the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-2066" id="footnote-ref-2066">[2066]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text"><a id="COD_WageGarnishment"></a><em>Wage garnishment—</em>If you are employed, a portion of your wages (up to 25%) can be automatically taken out (withheld) from your paycheck to pay your court-ordered debt. Money can continue to be taken from your paycheck until you have paid off the full amount you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2067" id="footnote-ref-2067">[2067]</a></sup> (For more information about what to do if your wages are being garnished by the Franchise Tax Board, see PG. 745.)<em>Property lien—</em>If you own property (like a car or a house) a <em>lien</em> can be put on your property. A lien gives the person (or agency) that you owe the right to <em>claim your property</em> to satisfy the debt you owe them. If you have a lien on your property, you may not be able to sell that property until you have paid off the amount you owe. If you DO sell the property, you will have to give over the money from the sale to the person you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2068" id="footnote-ref-2068">[2068]</a></sup><em>Lien on your bank account—</em>If you have a bank account, a lien can be put on the account. You will not be able to access the money in your account, and any checks you write from the account will bounce until the lien is removed.<sup><a href="#footnote-2069" id="footnote-ref-2069">[2069]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">All of these actions can lower your<em> credit score</em>, which can make it harder to get a loan, rent an apartment, or find a job. </p>
<h4>Other possible consequences:</h4>
<p class="text">There are other possible consequences of unpaid or overdue debt, but everyone’s situation will be different. Some other ways that you may be negatively impacted by unpaid court-ordered debt are:</p>
<ol class="text">Your <em>driver license</em> can be suspended due to unpaid court debts AND you can be charged extra fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2070" id="footnote-ref-2070">[2070]</a></sup> (Your driver license can also be suspended for other types of unpaid debt, such as child support or unpaid loans. See PG. 57 of the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER for more information about driver license suspensions.)It can be harder to get a <em>professional or occupational license</em>, which is required for many types of jobs. For example, you need an occupational license to work as a barber, beautician, nurse, or contractor. (For more information on professional/occupational licenses, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, PG. 654.)The Franchise Tax Board can seize any <em>state tax refunds,</em> <em>lottery winnings, or other income</em> to pay off your restitution and fine obligations.<sup><a href="#footnote-2071" id="footnote-ref-2071">[2071]</a></sup> If you are <em>ordered to appear</em> in court because you have not paid your court-ordered debt, and you do not go to court, you could be <em>arrested</em> and charged with a <em>misdemeanor</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2072" id="footnote-ref-2072">[2072]</a></sup> <em>Important</em>: If you have not made payments, you won’t be arrested simply for not paying. However, if a judge has ordered you to come to court and explain why you are not paying, you can be arrested for not going to court. If you receive an “order to appear,” you MUST go to court on the day and time listed in the order. Even if you don’t have any money to make the payments, it is very important that you attend this court hearing. Unpaid restitution and/or other fines can make it harder, to get your conviction dismissed under California’s “expungement” statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-2073" id="footnote-ref-2073">[2073]</a></sup> But, you cannot be denied a mandatory dismissal of your conviction just because you have unpaid victim restitution. (For more information, see PG 1062 in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS CHAPTER, beginning on PG 1029).</ol>
<h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintWhat is a “credit score,” and why does it matter?</h4>
<div class="widetextboxtext">A credit score is a record of how you have borrowed and repaid money in the past, and is considered a predictor of whether you are likely to repay your debts in the future. Your credit score is a number—usually between 300 and 850. <em>The higher the number, the better your score.</em> Your credit score is based on things like current debts you owe (including court-ordered debts), whether you've paid off previous debts in a timely manner, your income, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-2074" id="footnote-ref-2074">[2074]</a></sup> Creditors, landlords, and some employers may look at your credit score when deciding whether to give you a loan, rent an apartment to you, or hire you for a job. (<em>Note</em>: In California, only certain people can legally see your credit score. For more information about what employers and landlords can see about you, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER (PG. 595) and HOUSING CHAPTER (PG. 351).If you want to know what your credit score is, you will probably have to pay to get it from a commercial credit reporting agency. However, you are entitled to a FREE COPY of your credit report, which will let you see the information that is used to calculate your credit score. You can request your free credit report by mail by submitting an Annual Credit Report Request Form.<sup><a href="#footnote-2075" id="footnote-ref-2075">[2075]</a></sup> A sample form is included in Appendix A, PG. 756. For more information about getting your credit report, contact the Annual Credit Report Request Service at 1-877-322-8228. </div>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153516"></a>What are my options if my wages are garnished or there is a lien on my property?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL TIP: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">For more information on your credit report and your credit score, see Appendix I, PG. 781, or contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at (855) 411-2372, or online at: <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/search/?selected_facets=category_exact:credit-reporting">http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/search/?selected_facets=category_exact:credit-reporting</a>.</p>
<p class="text">If your wages are being garnished or there is a lien on your bank account or property, you may be able to request an <em>exemption</em> for money or property that you need to live on (such as your car or house). An exemption means that the portion of your wages or property that you need in order to support yourself and your family CANNOT be taken.<sup><a href="#footnote-2076" id="footnote-ref-2076">[2076]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text"><em>For more information about requesting an exemption from wage garnishment</em>, talk to your employer. You should have received a notice regarding your wage garnishment (called an “Earnings Withholding Order,” form WG-002) and instructions on how to request an exemption (Judicial Council form WG-003).<sup><a href="#footnote-2077" id="footnote-ref-2077">[2077]</a></sup> These forms are available in Appendix B, PG. 758, and Appendix C, PG. 761. They are also available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg002.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg002.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg003.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg003.pdf</a>.<em>To request an exemption from a property lien</em>, you will need to file a <em>Claim of Exemption (Judicial Council form EJ-160)</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2078" id="footnote-ref-2078">[2078]</a></sup> This form is provided in Appendix D, PG. 764 and is also available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf</a>. For a list of the types of property that you can request an exemption for see Appendix E, PG. 766 (Judicial Council form EJ-155), or go to <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf</a>.If your wages are being garnished by the CA Franchise Tax Board (FTB), you can claim a financial hardship and ask them to reduce the amount taken out of each paycheck.<sup><a href="#footnote-2079" id="footnote-ref-2079">[2079]</a></sup> Call the FTB at (916) 845-4064 to ask for assistance. (<em>Note</em>: The Franchise Tax Board CANNOT change the total amount of debt you owe, only the amount being taken from each paycheck.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2080" id="footnote-ref-2080">[2080]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">Even if you don’t have enough money to pay off your debts, it’s important to show that you are making an effort and want to pay them off! The court and judge will often work with you if you can <em>show that you are trying to take responsibility for your debt to the best of your ability</em>. You can ask the judge to help you set up an <em>installment plan</em>, or request that he or she <em>waive</em> (forgive) some of fines and fees. Many courts will let you do <em>community service</em> to work off your debt—or you can even opt to spend time in <em>jail</em> to pay off or reduce what you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2081" id="footnote-ref-2081">[2081]</a></sup>If your debt has been sent to a private collection agency or the FTB, you can ask that agency to help you set up a <em>payment plan</em>. If the FTB is garnishing your wages, you can also ask them to change the amount that is being taken out of your paycheck (but they CANNOT change the total amount of debt you owe.) The FTB can be very helpful—so don’t be afraid to contact them for assistance! The bottom line: Court-ordered debt can be a scary thing to deal with. But even if you can’t pay now, there are other things you can do to improve your situation. DON’T IGNORE YOUR DEBT or it will only get worse!</p>

<h1 class="subheading">Traffic fines and tickets</h1>
<h4 class="sidebox">What is “TRAFFIC COURT”?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Where all traffic-related issues are heard and addressed. Some counties have special traffic courts that deal exclusively with traffic-related issues. In others, the “traffic court” may just be a separate counter or department within the main courthouse. Traffic courts deal only with traffic infractions.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153518"></a><a id="COD_TrafficTickets_whatare"></a>What are traffic fines and tickets?</h3>
<p class="text"><strong><em>Traffic fines</em></strong> are penalties you are ordered to pay for driving-related or vehicle-related violations. Traffic tickets are the actual paper citations you get when you commit violations. There are three types of traffic tickets: </p>
<ol class="text"><strong><em>PARKING TICKETS—</em></strong>Parking tickets are for violations while your vehicle is parked (for example, if you park your car where or when you’re not allowed to, or don’t pay the parking meter).<sup><a href="#footnote-2082" id="footnote-ref-2082">[2082]</a></sup><strong><em>INFRACTION TICKETS</em>—</strong>Infraction tickets are for minor driving violations (such as running a stop sign or failing to use a turn signal), or often for mechanical problems with your car equipment (such as a broken tail-light), or for administrative violations related to your registration, insurance, or Drive License (for example, if one of these has expired).<sup><a href="#footnote-2083" id="footnote-ref-2083">[2083]</a></sup><strong><em>MISDEMEANOR TICKETS</em>—</strong>Misdemeanor tickets are issued for more serious driving violations (like a DUI or driving on a suspended license—these are types of misdemeanor criminal convictions).</ol>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">NOTE: ANOTHER NAME FOR TRAFFIC FINES IS “BAIL”—</span>Traffic fines are also called “<em>bail.</em>” The traffic court may use this term when talking about your traffic fines and payments. Traffic “bail” is not the same thing as bail in a criminal case, but is sometimes used in a similar way. As of June 8, 2015, if you are required to appear in court for an <em>infraction</em> ticket, you no longer need to “post bail” (pay some or all of your traffic fine) beforehand, except in a few situations.<sup><a href="#footnote-2084" id="footnote-ref-2084">[2084]</a></sup> If you are required to appear in court for a <em>misdemeanor</em> ticket, you may need to “post bail” (pay some or all of your traffic fine) BEFORE your court date. You will then get this money back if the court dismisses your ticket or finds you not guilty of the traffic violation. This Chapter will use the term “fines” instead of “bail” to describe the money you owe for a traffic ticket. </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">What are “Fix-it” Tickets (Correctable Violations)?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">A correctible violation (“fix-it”) ticket is a ticket for a problem with your car that you must fix (for example, a broken tail light, expired registration. After you fix the problem, and show the court proof, your ticket will be dismissed. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153519"></a>How do I know which type of ticket I have?</h3>
<p><em>If you park or leave your car somewhere and there is a ticket on the windshield when you get back</em>, this is probably a <em>parking ticket (although some agencies will issue “fix-it” tickets for parked cars with visible mechanical issues or expired registration tags)</em>. Parking tickets are the least serious type of ticket and do NOT involve the courts.</p>
<p><em>If you get pulled over and get a ticket while driving</em>, it is an <em>infraction</em> or a <em>misdemeanor</em> <em>ticket</em>. Usually you get these tickets from a law enforcement officer who pulls you over on the road for a violation you committed while driving.</p>
<ol class="text">An <em>infraction ticket</em> will instruct you to either <em>pay a fine</em>, or <em>appear in court</em> on a particular date and time if you want to challenge the ticket or can’t pay the fine. For a <em>misdemeanor ticket</em>, you MUST <em>appear in court</em> on the date and time shown or a warrant will be issued for your arrest. (That’s why the ticket is also called a “Notice to Appear”). </ol>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">NOTE:</span> For some <em>misdemeanor violations</em> (for example, a DUI), the police may <em>arrest</em> you on the spot and take you into custody. You may need to <em>pay bail</em> and/or sign a <em>promise to appear in court</em> before the police let you go. Afterward, you MUST <em>appear in court</em> on the date and time assigned to you in the promise to appear.</p>
<p><em>Tickets related to your car equipment, registration, insurance, or Driver License</em> are usually <em>infraction tickets</em>. Sometimes you can get the ticket dismissed if you correct the problem that you were cited for (also called a “fix-it” ticket or “correctable violation”). </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: When you sign any ticket, you are making a promise to do something—pay the fine, appear in court, and/or correct the problem as required by the ticket. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153520"></a>What could happen if I get a new ticket? </h3>
<p class="text">It depends on the type of ticket you get.<span class="emphasisitalic">Parking tickets:</span><em> </em>If you get a parking ticket, you just have to pay a fine. The ticket will have information about how much the fine is, what agency you owe it to (usually to the local city government or parking authority), and how to pay (by mail, in person, by phone, or online). If you disagree with the ticket, you can contact the parking agency and ask how to challenge it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2085" id="footnote-ref-2085">[2085]</a></sup> I<em>f you don’t pay the parking ticket on time</em>, the fines will increase. <em>Eventually</em>, if you haven’t paid the fine, you will not be able to renew your car registration. Parking tickets will NOT affect your ability to get a state ID or driver license because parking tickets attach to a <em>vehicle</em>, NOT a person.<sup><a href="#footnote-2086" id="footnote-ref-2086">[2086]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Infraction tickets:</span><em> </em>If you get an infraction ticket, read the ticket carefully to see what to do. You may just need to <em>pay a fine</em> or you may have to fix whatever problem the ticket was issued for and then bring proof to the issuing agency. However, you may be required to <em>appear in court</em> on a particular date and time. You must act BEFORE the deadline on your ticket. <em>Remember, by signing the ticket, you have promised to pay the fine, correct the problem, or appear in court</em>.You may have to:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Pay the fine</em>, which means you plead guilty to the violation and the court will close the case. The infraction will appear as a conviction on your Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) record, but it will not be considered a criminal conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2087" id="footnote-ref-2087">[2087]</a></sup> It may add “points” to your driving record, which may have other consequences.<sup><a href="#footnote-2088" id="footnote-ref-2088">[2088]</a></sup>NOTE: You may be eligible to go to “traffic school,” to keep the conviction points off your record.<sup><a href="#footnote-2089" id="footnote-ref-2089">[2089]</a></sup> (For more information about traffic school, see PG. 749.)<em>Go to court</em> on the day and time listed on the ticket. You can plead not guilty and ask for a trial to dispute the ticket, or plead guilty to the infraction and pay the fine.<sup><a href="#footnote-2090" id="footnote-ref-2090">[2090]</a></sup> <em>If you want to contest the ticket</em> (plead not guilty) but were NOT required to appear in court, you can request a <em>trial by written declaration</em>. This means that instead of going to court to fight your case, you and the police officer give the judge statements and evidence in writing.<sup><a href="#footnote-2091" id="footnote-ref-2091">[2091]</a></sup><em>If you got a “fix-it” ticket</em>,<strong> </strong>you can have your case dismissed by fixing the problem, showing proof that you have made the correction, and paying a fee. To get a proof of correction, you must get an “authorized person” to sign the “Certificate of Correction” line on your ticket. An “authorized person” is:A DMV or court clerk—for driver license and car registration violations;A police officer—for equipment violations;A court clerk—for proof of car insurance.<sup><a href="#footnote-2092" id="footnote-ref-2092">[2092]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text"><strong>If you are on probation, parole, or community supervision:</strong> In most cases, an infraction ticket won’t be considered a violation of your probation or parole because infractions are not criminal offenses. However, in some cases, an infraction ticket <em>could</em> be a violation of your supervision, depending on your underlying conviction, the specific conditions of your supervision, and the nature of the infraction. For example, if you are on probation for a DUI offense and have conditions related to alcohol and driving, a ticket for having an open container in your vehicle might be considered a violation of your supervision. If you have any questions or concerns about your terms of supervision, you should talk to your probation or parole officer (or better yet, a lawyer). (You can also find more information in the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130.)<span class="emphasisitalic">Misdemeanor tickets:</span><em> </em>For a misdemeanor ticket, you <em>must</em> go to court on the date shown on your ticket. If you want to dispute (deny) the charges, you can plead not guilty and ask for a trial. You are entitled to have a lawyer represent you throughout the process. If you cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint a public defender to represent you. You may have to pay a fine (bail) in advance, but you will get the money back if you are found not guilty.<sup><a href="#footnote-2093" id="footnote-ref-2093">[2093]</a></sup> In some cases (for serious misdemeanors, like DUIs, or for repeat offenses), you may also face jail time and/or have your license suspended or revoked. </p>
<p class="importantbox">WARNING:<em> If you are on probation, parole, or community supervision</em>, a misdemeanor ticket could be a violation of your probation or parole conditions. You should contact a lawyer immediately, if you can. (For more information on how a new criminal offense may affect your community supervision, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130.)</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153521"></a>What could happen if I don’t pay my traffic fines or if I don’t appear for my court date? </h3>
<p class="text">There are serious consequences if you don’t pay your traffic fines, or if you don’t show up for your court date:<sup><a href="#footnote-2094" id="footnote-ref-2094">[2094]</a></sup></p>
<h4>FAILURE TO PAY YOUR FINES:</h4>
<ol class="text">The amount you owe in traffic fines can increase by A LOT. You may be charged interest and additional fees as penalties for paying late or not paying at all.<sup><a href="#footnote-2095" id="footnote-ref-2095">[2095]</a></sup> If you agreed to make installment payments to the court for your traffic fines, and you do not make the required payments, the court can order you to pay a $300 civil assessment fine.<sup><a href="#footnote-2096" id="footnote-ref-2096">[2096]</a></sup>Your debt could be referred to a collection agency, which can affect your credit score and, in turn, your ability to get a loan, rent an apartment, or qualify for some jobs. (See PG. 730 for more information on “collections”).<em>For infraction and misdemeanor tickets</em>—Your driver license can be suspended if you don’t pay your fines on time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2097" id="footnote-ref-2097">[2097]</a></sup> This means that you CANNOT legally drive a car, and you can be charged with other offenses if you drive while your license is suspended.<sup><a href="#footnote-2098" id="footnote-ref-2098">[2098]</a></sup> You will not get your license back until you pay off all fines and fees you owe—plus <em>additional</em> fees for having your license suspended and reissued.<sup><a href="#footnote-2099" id="footnote-ref-2099">[2099]</a></sup><em>For parking tickets</em>—You will not be allowed to renew your car registration if you owe unpaid parking fines for that car (and you may be charged an extra fee for having your registration suspended).<sup><a href="#footnote-2100" id="footnote-ref-2100">[2100]</a></sup> Your car MUST be registered with the DMV in order for you or anyone else to drive it, but the DMV will NOT let you renew your registration until you pay off all fines and fees you owe. This means your car CANNOT legally be driven or sold during this time (and you can be charged with other offenses if you drive your car when it’s not registered).<sup><a href="#footnote-2101" id="footnote-ref-2101">[2101]</a></sup> But remember, parking tickets attach to specific CARS—NOT people—so you CAN still drive other cars during this time.<em>If you have a correctable violation (“fix-it” ticket)</em> and do not make the corrections required by the ticket OR do not provide proof of correction, you can be charged with a misdemeanor.<sup><a href="#footnote-2102" id="footnote-ref-2102">[2102]</a></sup>A Judge may order you to appear in court to explain why you have not paid your ticket.</ol>
<h4>FAILURE TO APPEAR IN COURT:</h4>
<p class="text">If a judge has ordered you to appear in court because of your unpaid ticket, you must appear. If you do not, the court can charge you with a misdemeanor for “failure to appear” or “contempt of court,” and issue a warrant for your arrest.<sup><a href="#footnote-2103" id="footnote-ref-2103">[2103]</a></sup></p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153522"></a><a id="COD_TrafficTickets_old_cantremember"></a>I think I had an old traffic ticket, but I can’t remember or can’t find it. What are my options?</h3>
<p class="text">Old traffic tickets can be difficult to track down! This is because cities, counties, the state, and even some colleges have the power to issue traffic tickets—and each agency may handle overdue tickets differently. This can make it hard to know <em>whether</em> you owe unpaid traffic fines, <em>how much </em>you owe, <em>whom</em> you owe fines to, and <em>what to do </em>next. The first step is to find out where your ticket is.</p>
<h4>For parking tickets: </h4>
<ol class="text"><em>If you CAN remember where you got the ticket</em>, you can contact the city where you got the ticket and ask how to resolve a parking ticket. If the city has a separate department or agency that handles traffic tickets, you will need to speak with someone from that office directly.<em>If you CAN’T remember where you got the ticket</em>, you can contact the DMV and ask whether there are any <em>holds</em> on your car registration. (A <em>hold</em> means that you are not allowed to renew your registration because you didn’t pay a parking ticket.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2104" id="footnote-ref-2104">[2104]</a></sup> The DMV will be able to tell you which county, city, or parking agency put the hold on your registration—this is where you owe one or more outstanding parking tickets.<sup><a href="#footnote-2105" id="footnote-ref-2105">[2105]</a></sup>You will also find out about any unpaid parking tickets when it’s time to renew your car registration (which you have to do every year). The DMV will send you an annual notice to renew your registration which will list any unpaid parking fines you owe and where you got each ticket.<sup><a href="#footnote-2106" id="footnote-ref-2106">[2106]</a></sup> You will not be allowed to renew your registration until you pay all these fines and fees. <sup><a href="#footnote-2107" id="footnote-ref-2107">[2107]</a></sup></ol>
<h4>For infraction and misdemeanor tickets: </h4>
<ol class="text">The easiest way to track down all of your old misdemeanor and infraction tickets is through the DMV. You can go to any DMV office and ask for a list of your<em> warrants</em>, which should be available for free.<sup><a href="#footnote-2108" id="footnote-ref-2108">[2108]</a></sup> The list of warrants will show all outstanding traffic tickets where you failed to appear in court (FTAs) and/or failed to pay (FTPs), and will also show where you got the ticket.<sup><a href="#footnote-2109" id="footnote-ref-2109">[2109]</a></sup>You can also ask the DMV whether there are any <em>holds</em> on your driver license due to outstanding traffic tickets.<sup><a href="#footnote-2110" id="footnote-ref-2110">[2110]</a></sup> (A <em>hold</em> means that your license has been suspended and/or you cannot renew it because you didn’t pay a traffic ticket or you failed to appear in court.) The DMV will be able to tell you which court put the hold on your license—this is where you owe outstanding traffic tickets.<sup><a href="#footnote-2111" id="footnote-ref-2111">[2111]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153523"></a>What are my options if the DMV told me I have an outstanding traffic ticket?</h3>
<h4><a id="COD_TrafficSchool_Outstanding"></a><a id="COD_TrafficSchool_OutstandingParking"></a>For parking tickets: </h4>
<ol class="text">Once you know where you owe old parking tickets, you should contact the local parking authority directly to find out how much you owe and what to do next. If the ticket is old enough, it may have been sent to collections. If this is the case, you will need to contact the collection agency (county collections, a private agency, or the California Franchise Tax Board) to find out how to pay off your debt. (For more information on finding the collection agency that has your parking ticket debt, see PG. 743.)</ol>
<p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you have multiple tickets, there may be more than one hold on your vehicle registration. It’s important to pay off any tickets with registration holds <em>first</em>, so that you can renew your registration!</strong></p>
<h4><a id="COD_TrafficSchool_Outstand_nfracMisde"></a>For infraction and misdemeanor tickets:</h4>
<p class="text">If you got an infraction or misdemeanor traffic ticket and you: (1) did not pay the ticket; (2) did not go to court on the date listed on the ticket; or (3) went to court and were ordered to pay a fine by the judge, but did not pay the fine, then you should see if you qualify for the new Traffic Amnesty Program.</p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ARREST WARRANTS: When you are charged with a “failure to appear” (FTA) or “failure to pay” (FTP), the traffic court judge may order a warrant for your arrest.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2112" id="footnote-ref-2112">[2112]</a></sup></strong> IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT YOU HAVE AN ARREST WARRANT for one of these reasons, it can be very helpful to CONTACT A LAWYER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. A lawyer may be able to get you a court date to try and fix the situation.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2113" id="footnote-ref-2113">[2113]</a></sup></strong> It is very important to attend any court dates! Be aware that even if you go to court to get the warrant removed, you will likely still have to pay for the ticket and any additional fines and fees. To reduce these fines and fees, you should ask if you qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program—learn more about it on PG. 750.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153524"></a>I had a traffic ticket that was pending (unresolved) when I was incarcerated. What might have happened to it?</h3>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">If you were formerly incarcerated in a California state prison:</span> Under state law, the DMV must dismiss most non-felony traffic tickets that were pending when you went to prison. A ticket is “pending” when the court has not yet made a decision in the case (meaning, never ordered you to pay the fine). Only tickets for misdemeanor traffic offenses and infractions can be dismissed under this law. Parking tickets CANNOT be dismissed this way.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2114" id="footnote-ref-2114">[2114]</a></sup></sup> <em>PLEASE NOTE: this rule only applies to people who were incarcerated in state prisons!</em></p>
<h4>Additionally, your traffic ticket CANNOT be dismissed if:</h4>
<ol class="text">You got the ticket while you were on parole;<sup><a href="#footnote-2115" id="footnote-ref-2115">[2115]</a></sup>The ticket is for an offense that would require the DMV to automatically revoke or suspend your driver license if you were convicted;<sup><a href="#footnote-2116" id="footnote-ref-2116">[2116]</a></sup>You are serving your sentence in county jail under Realignment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2117" id="footnote-ref-2117">[2117]</a></sup> </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153525"></a>I think my traffic ticket qualifies for dismissal. How can I get it dismissed?</h3>
<p class="text">You must proactively request dismissal from the DMV directly. The court will not automatically do this on your behalf. You will need to send a letter to the DMV on official California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation letterhead, and get it signed by an “Authorized Representative.” </p>
<ol class="text"><em>If you’re currently incarcerated</em>,<em> </em>you should ask your Correctional Counselor or other prison staff person to provide letterhead and sign off on your request. <em>If you’re formerly incarcerated and on some form of community supervision like probation or parole</em>, you will have to ask your parole or probation officer to provide letterhead and sign off on your request.<sup><a href="#footnote-2118" id="footnote-ref-2118">[2118]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">The letter should say that you are requesting dismissal of your misdemeanor or infraction ticket under Vehicle Code Section 41500, and it must include the dates of your commitment and release (if you’re out). Send your request to: </p>
<p class="address">Department of Motor VehiclesDivision of Drivers Safety and LicensingP.O. Box 9412890Sacramento, CA 94290</p>
<p>A DMV employee will then review your request to decide if your ticket qualifies for dismissal. </p>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTHere are 3 options if you are struggling to pay your traffic fines:</h4>
<p class="textbox">Payment Plans—If you owe unpaid traffic fines, you can contact the court, parking authority, or collection agency that you owe money to and ask about setting up a <em>payment or installment plan </em>(where you pay off a little every month instead of everything all at once). Amnesty Programs—California now has a statewide Traffic Amnesty Program to help people reduce the amount of traffic debt owed and in some cases, reinstate a suspended Driver License.<sup><a href="#footnote-2119" id="footnote-ref-2119">[2119]</a></sup> Contact the traffic court in the county where you owe money for more information about the program.Specialty Courts—Some counties have special <em>homeless courts, DUI courts, or other community courts</em> that may be able to help you resolve your tickets and fines. Contact the local public defender in the county where you got the ticket to ask if there are any community courts available and whether you are eligible. What if I owe court-ordered debt for a federal offense?</p>
<p class="text">Up to this point, this Chapter has <em>only</em> covered debts that were ordered by a <em>California state court</em>, NOT those ordered by a federal court. If you have debts that stem from a <em>federal</em> offense, your court-ordered debt will look different, because federal courts have their own rules for restitution, fines, and fees. However, these 3 general <em>types</em> of debt are the same in the federal system:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Restitution</em>: <em>Repays any victims</em> (people, organizations, government agencies, etc.) that suffered harm, property damage, or monetary losses caused by your actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2120" id="footnote-ref-2120">[2120]</a></sup> This is like <em>victim restitution</em> in state court.<em>Fines</em>: Serve as additional <em>punishment</em> for your offense and are part of your criminal sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2121" id="footnote-ref-2121">[2121]</a></sup> The amount of the fine will depend on the crime for which you were convicted.<sup><a href="#footnote-2122" id="footnote-ref-2122">[2122]</a></sup> These are like <em>fines and penalties</em> in state court<em>.Special Assessments</em>: Fees assigned for each separate offense you were convicted of. The amount of the Assessment depends on the seriousness of the offense. <em>ALL of your federal Special Assessment debt will be forgiven 5 years after your conviction, after which you will no longer owe this debt</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2123" id="footnote-ref-2123">[2123]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="importantbox">WARNING: Just like for state court debt, you may also owe additional interest or other penalties on your federal court-ordered debt (for example, if you don’t make required payments on time).</p>
<h2><a id="_Toc448153526"></a><a id="COD_TakingControl_Intro"></a>TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR COURT-ORDERED DEBT</h2>
<h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
<ul class="learn-bullets">How to take control of your court-ordered debt, including:How find out how much you owe; How to get your debt reduced or forgiven; andStrategies for managing and paying off your debt.</ul>
<p class="text">Taking control of your court-ordered debt is done by knowing the type of debt you owe, the amount of debt you owe, and creating plan as to how to repay this debt while understanding whether this debt has impact on your terms of probation and/or employment. In Part III, we will answer the following questions for each type of debt:</p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153527"></a>How do I find out how much court-ordered debt I owe?</h3>
<p class="text">Since there are typically three types of debt: restitution, court fines and penalties, and court administrative fees, to find out how much you owe requires you to ask different questions to different people/agencies to make sure you know of all of your debt and to figure out how much you owe. Below three different debt types are discussed as well as debts you may owe if you received traffic tickets as part of your case or if you had tickets prior to being incarcerated. </p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153528"></a>Restitution</h1>
<p class="text"><em>If you are incarcerated</em>, you should be able to get a copy of your restitution balance sheet from your facility (either a CDCR facility or county jail). Ask your Correctional Counselor if you have any questions about your restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2124" id="footnote-ref-2124">[2124]</a></sup> <em>If you have just been released</em>, your facility (or the agency it has chosen) will either continue to collect your debt itself or refer your debt out to a private collection agency or the Franchise Tax Board.<sup><a href="#footnote-2125" id="footnote-ref-2125">[2125]</a></sup> You should get a demand notice from whichever agency will continue collecting your restitution debt within 90 days of your release, although there is no set time for this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2126" id="footnote-ref-2126">[2126]</a></sup> </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">REQUESTING copies of your ORIGINAL SENTENCING ORDERS</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you want to see what amounts you were originally ordered to pay, you can request a copy of your sentencing order from the court that sentenced you. HOWEVER, these amounts are the <em>original</em> amounts ordered by the court, and will NOT reflect any payments that you’ve made OR include any interest or fees that have been added since. The order also will NOT show the debts you owe from ANY other cases.</p>
<p class="text"><em>If you are on parole, probation, or community supervision</em>, talk to your parole agent or probation officer.<sup><a href="#footnote-2127" id="footnote-ref-2127">[2127]</a></sup> They can give you a copy of your balance sheet, which has information about how much you currently owe. At any time, you can also find out how much you owe by contacting an Adult Restitution Agent at the CDCR Office of Victim &amp; Survivor Rights &amp; Services Restitution Unit at (877) 256-6877 (toll free). They will be able to tell you your restitution balance and can give you information about what to do while you wait for the collection agency to contact you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2128" id="footnote-ref-2128">[2128]</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153529"></a>I haven’t ever received notice that I owe any money for restitution, so I probably don’t, right? </h3>
<p class="text">Not necessarily. While you <em>should</em> receive notice of your debt, it is possible that you won’t. As we said in the beginning of this Chapter, any number of things may have prevented the notice of your debt from getting to you. Even if you have received a demand notice, it is possible that the notice you received only covered <em>some</em>, but NOT <em>all</em> of your debts. Remember, your various debts may have been sent to different agencies. For this reason, it is possible that you owe money even if you did NOT receive a notice and it is possible that you owe more money than the notice stated. It is always better to check in order to be safe!</p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153530"></a>Court fines and penalties and court administrative fees</h1>
<p class="text">As discussed on PG. 725, court fines and penalties are debts you may get as punishment or consequences for the crime you were charged with. Court administrative fees are paid for the daily operation of the court. While these two debts are different, here these debts are discussed together because the court usually adds these fees together and requires you to pay them together and to one office. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153531"></a><a id="COD_CourtAdminFee_PtII_collections_howto"></a>How do I find out if I have any court fines and fees?</h3>
<h4 class="step"><a id="COD_CtFinesPenalAdmin_howmuchowe"></a>Contact the court where you were convicted</h4>
<p class="text">To find out how much you owe in court fines and fees, you should start by contacting the court in the county where you were convicted. You should try to provide your case number, however you may be able to locate your case using your name, birth date, and/or other personal information. If you have any court papers from your case, they will list your case number and the county you were convicted in. If you don’t have any of your court papers, you may need to get a copy of your RAP sheet to figure out what court(s) you have convictions from. </p>
<h4 class="step"><a id="COD_CtFinesPenalAdmin_finddebt"></a>Find out where your debt is now</h4>
<p class="text">When you contact the court, the clerk should be able to tell you what you were ordered to pay, whether your case has been sent to collections, and if so, which collection agency now has your debt. Remember, if you have convictions from multiple cases, even if they are all in the same county, you will need to ask about every case. If you have convictions from different counties, you will need to contact the court in each county.Make sure to ask the court for the contact information for each and every agency that will be collecting your debt. If some or all of your debt is still with the court, ask the clerk how to contact the court’s “collection” or “revenue” unit (the department that keeps track of court-ordered debts and payments). (For a list of California county court collection unit contact information, see Appendix G, PG. 774.) </p>
<h4 class="step"><a id="COD_CtFinesPenalAdmin_contactcollections"></a>Contact the collection agency in charge of your debt</h4>
<p class="text">Once you know which collection agency is collecting your debt, you can contact them directly to ask how much you owe and how to pay. Remember that your debts may be collected by several different collection agencies, so you may need to contact all the different agencies to find out how much you owe in total. You may get shuffled around to many different people, but this is important, so be patient!</p>

<h4>General information about traffic fines:</h4>
<p class="text">An important thing to know about traffic fines is that <em>there are lots of additional fees and penalties that can get added to your initial fine</em>. These extra fees and penalties are added <em>automatically</em>—regardless of whether it’s a new or old ticket, and even if you pay everything on time! Your fines may also increase if you have prior traffic violations or points on your driving record. Depending on what your original ticket was for, the additional fees and penalties can sometimes add up to several hundred dollars for an infraction ticket (and much more for a misdemeanor ticket).<sup><a href="#footnote-2133" id="footnote-ref-2133">[2133]</a></sup></p>
<h2><a id="_Toc448153534"></a>paying off or “satisfying” my court-ordered debt </h2>

<h3><a id="COD_Restitution_PayingWhileIncarcerated"></a><a id="_Toc448153536"></a>How do I pay restitution while incarcerated? </h3>
<p class="text">CDCR (or the county jail) will automatically deduct victim restitution, and, if possible, restitution fine payments from deposits in your trust account and any wages you earn.<sup><a href="#footnote-2134" id="footnote-ref-2134">[2134]</a></sup> You can also make voluntary payments whenever you like.</p>

(See PG. 745 for FTB contact information.) If you also want to pay off your restitution fines (or parole revocation fines) voluntarily while you are on parole, you can send these payments directly to CDCR.

<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: PAY OFF CONDITION-OF-PROBATION DEBTS FIRST! Always try to pay off debts that are <em>conditions of your probation</em> first, as these can affect the length of your probation.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2138" id="footnote-ref-2138">[2138]</a></sup></sup></strong> (Payments are supposed to go to these debts first automatically, but this doesn’t always happen.)<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2139" id="footnote-ref-2139">[2139]</a></sup></strong>BUT NOTE: If you are entitled to a mandatory dismissal of a conviction under Cal.

<p class="text">Make your payments in-person, online, or by mail:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>If you make a payment in person</em>, ask the clerk (or collections representative) who receives your payment to put it toward your restitution and any other fines imposed as conditions of your probation first.<em>If you make payments online</em>, you can select which fines or fees your payment will go toward.

<ol class="text">Set Up a Payment Plan: Contact the FTB to discuss your options for paying your debt in installments instead of all at once;Manage Your Payments Online: Set up an online account to instantly view your current balance, make payments, and keep records of the debt you have already paid.Get Your Payments Reduced: If the FTB is taking too much money out of your paycheck (called “wage garnishment”) and you don’t have enough to live on, you can claim financial hardship and ask the FTB to reduce the amount being taken out of each paycheck. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2142" id="footnote-ref-2142">[2142]</a></sup></sup> (Note: The FTB can only lower the amount taken from each payment, but cannot reduce the total amount of debt that you owe.) (See PG. 730 for more information on wage garnishment.) Dispute the Amount You Owe: If you disagree with the AMOUNT of debt you owe, you will need to contact the local court or county collection agency listed on your demand notice (the document notifying you that you owe money) directly.

<p class="sidebox">If you don’t make payments on time or don’t go to court when you’re supposed to, the judge adds an extra fee of $300 to your debt. This is called a “civil assessment.” If the reason you didn’t pay or appear in court was because you were incarcerated, and you were charged with a civil assessment as a result, you should be able to get it waived by filing a “Petition to Vacate Civil Assessment.” This form is available from the court clerk. A sample form is also available in Appendix H, PG. 779.</p>
<p><strong>The process for collecting court fines and fees is complicated and may be different from county to county. In general, you can follow these instructions:</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2143" id="footnote-ref-2143">[2143]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">Contact the court(s) where you were convicted </h4>
<p class="text">See PG. 741 (Step 1 on how to find out how much you owe in court fines and administrative fees) for instructions on how to identify and contact the court(s) where you were convicted.</p>
<h4 class="step">Find out who is in charge of collecting your debt and contact them</h4>
<p class="text">Different counties have different methods for collecting court fines and fees. Depending on where you are located, collection may be handled by different agencies, including the court itself, a county agency, a private collection agency, or the Franchise Tax Board. See PG. 742 above (Steps 2-3 on how to find out how much you owe in court fines and administrative fees) for instructions on how to identify and contact the agency(ies) in charge of collecting your debt.Remember that your debts may be collected by several different collection agencies, so you may need to contact each of these different agencies about making payments. </p>
<h4 class="step">Discuss your payment options.</h4>
<p class="text">When you contact the collection agency or court that’s in charge of your debt, a representative can help you design a payment plan that works best for your situation. The goal is to create a plan that will prevent you from facing extra fees or other penalties (like a hold on your DMV record) that can result from late or insufficient payments. It is important to be open and honest about your current financial situation, including whether or not you have a job, pay child support, or owe any other debts or payments. Most of the time, the collection representative will take these things into account and work with you to create a plan that you can realistically stick to.Depending on your individual situation and the amount of money you owe, the collection agency may ask you to pay everything off right away. In other situations, they may allow you to set up a payment plan so that you make smaller payments over time. Remember that the agency or court might charge a fee to cover the costs of managing your payment plan, and might charge additional fees for each payment you make.<sup><a href="#footnote-2144" id="footnote-ref-2144">[2144]</a></sup> Collection agencies can also charge BIG penalty fees for any late payments (or even demand that you pay off the entire remaining amount due). <em>Make sure you ask about fees and penalties and/or read the fine print before you agree to a payment plan!</em><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153542"></a>What might happen if I can’t pay my debt?</h3>
<p class="text">If you don’t keep up with your payments, your debt becomes delinquent (overdue). The agency in charge of collecting your debt will send a notice letter to your last known address explaining that your payment is overdue.<sup><a href="#footnote-2145" id="footnote-ref-2145">[2145]</a></sup> After 10 days, the court or agency may order you to pay extra fees on top of what you already owe, or they may put a hold on your DMV record.<sup><a href="#footnote-2146" id="footnote-ref-2146">[2146]</a></sup> The amount of late fees you may owe will depend on many factors, including what county your debt is in, what agency is in charge of collection, and the amount of debt you owe. (For more information on fair debt collection practices, see Appendix F, PG. 769.)</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">If you are on parole</span>, talk to your parole agent and explain that you are having a hard time making payments. He or she may be able to work with you to help you manage this debt.<sup><a href="#footnote-2147" id="footnote-ref-2147">[2147]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">If you are on probation</span>, talk to your probation officer and explain that you are having a hard time making payments. The probation department or the court may do a financial evaluation (meaning a consideration of your income, other debts, etc.), and will decide whether to reduce your payment amounts based on your inability to pay.<sup><a href="#footnote-2148" id="footnote-ref-2148">[2148]</a></sup> You also have the right to ask to court to reduce some or all of your fines and fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2149" id="footnote-ref-2149">[2149]</a></sup> Keep in mind, however, that the judge can also order you to look for work as a condition of your probation, and may require you to bring in proof that you’re applying for jobs every week.<sup><a href="#footnote-2150" id="footnote-ref-2150">[2150]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="answer">IN GENERAL, YOUR INABILITY TO PAY WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED A VIOLATION IF IT IS DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND YOUR CONTROL. <em>However, in more serious cases, you could have your probation extended or even revoked if</em>: </p>
<ol class="text">you’re not paying debts that are a condition of your probation AND you are also violating other probation conditions (such as reporting requirements), OR the court thinks that you are willfully refusing to pay. </ol>
<p class="answer">For this reason, it is very important that you speak with your probation officer and make it clear that you are not avoiding payments on purpose. If you are able to make even very small payments, this will help show the court and your probation officer that you are making an effort.</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">If you are not on any form of supervision</span>, contact the agency in charge of collecting your debt and ask to set a new payment plan. (See PG. 742 for information on how to find and contact the agency in charge of your debt to set up a payment plan.)<span class="emphasisitalic">If you are re-incarcerated</span>, the debt associated with your prior conviction will not go away. You will still be responsible for paying it off. However, you should not face any extra fees or interest charges for failing to pay while you are inside.<sup><a href="#footnote-2151" id="footnote-ref-2151">[2151]</a></sup> If for some reason you are charged a fee for missing a payment while incarcerated, you should contact the court or collection agency when you are released and provide them with proof that you were incarcerated during that time period to have the fee waived.<sup><a href="#footnote-2152" id="footnote-ref-2152">[2152]</a></sup></ol>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153543"></a>Traffic fines and fees</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153544"></a>How do I pay my traffic fines? </h3>
<p class="text">It depends on the type of traffic fine.</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">For parking tickets</span>, send your payment to the parking agency listed on the ticket.<span class="emphasisitalic">For infraction tickets</span>: Read the ticket carefully—it will tell you whether to pay a fine or appear in court. <span class="emphasisitalic">If you are paying a fine</span>, you will make payments to the court in the county where you received the ticket. Check the ticket for specific information about how and where to send your payment. You may also get a letter from the court—most counties will send you information about how to pay or contest (challenge) your ticket, and whether you have the option of attending traffic school instead. You can also contact the court right away to set up a payment plan.<sup><a href="#footnote-2153" id="footnote-ref-2153">[2153]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">The ticket will also indicate whether you have a “<em>correctable violation</em>.” If so, you can have your ticket AND traffic fine <em>dismissed</em> by fixing the problem, showing proof that you have made the correction, and paying a dismissal fee.<sup><a href="#footnote-2154" id="footnote-ref-2154">[2154]</a></sup> To get proof that you have corrected the problem, you must get an authorized person to sign the “<em>Certificate of Correction</em>” line on your ticket. Bring the <em>signed</em> ticket and your dismissal fee payment to the court clerk BEFORE the deadline on the ticket. (In some cases, you may also be able to send your proof of correction and payment by mail—check your ticket or contact the court to find out.) The court will then dismiss your case and it will not go on your record.</p>
<ol class="text">For driver license &amp; car registration violations, get the DMV or a court clerk to sign your ticket.For equipment violations, get your ticket signed by a police officer.For proof of car insurance at the time of the citation, get your ticket signed by a court clerk.</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>TRAFFIC SCHOOL MIGHT BE AN OPTION:</strong><a id="COD_TrafficSchool_GenInfo"></a>In some cases, you may be able to attend <em>traffic school</em> for your ticket.<sup><a href="#footnote-2155" id="footnote-ref-2155">[2155]</a></sup> Traffic school is a driver training class that you can take to make sure that your ticket does not show on your driving record. Tickets can impact your driving record by adding “points” to it. Points on your record can cause your insurance rate to increase and can even result in the suspension or revocation of your license. You may get a letter from the court telling you if traffic school is an option, but you can also contact the court directly to ask. If the court lets you go to traffic school, you will need to complete the course by a specific deadline and provide a certificate of completion to prove that you have completed it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2156" id="footnote-ref-2156">[2156]</a></sup> <em>Make sure you attend a traffic school that is approved by the court, otherwise you will not receive credit for completing the course. </em>The court can provide you with a list of approved schools. If you successfully complete traffic school, your ticket will still go on your driving record, but it will be made <em>confidential</em> (hidden).<sup><a href="#footnote-2157" id="footnote-ref-2157">[2157]</a></sup> Also, you will still have to pay all of your traffic fines, AND you will also have to pay additional enrollment fees to the court and to the traffic school.<sup><a href="#footnote-2158" id="footnote-ref-2158">[2158]</a></sup> However, you will NOT get any points added to your driving record,<sup><a href="#footnote-2159" id="footnote-ref-2159">[2159]</a></sup> which means your insurance rates won’t go up and your license will not be in danger of suspension or revocation. So, even though traffic school can cost you MORE money in the SHORT term, it can SAVE you a lot of money and trouble in the LONG run.

<h4 class="textbox">ACTION ITEM: CAN I GO TO TRAFFIC SCHOOL?	</h4>
<p class="textbox">Generally, you can go to traffic school if:</p>
<ul class="textbox">You have a valid, regular (not commercial) Driver License,Your ticket is for a moving violation that is an infraction (not a misdemeanor), andYou were driving a regular (non-commercial) vehicle when you got the ticket.</ul>
<p class="textbox">Some reasons why you may NOT be eligible for traffic school:</p>
<ul class="textbox">You have a parking ticket or misdemeanor ticket;Your ticket was for a serious moving violation—including speeding more than 25mph over the speed limit;Your ticket was for a DUI or other drug/alcohol-related violation; You’ve gone to traffic school for another ticket within the past 18 months; orYou were driving a commercial vehicle when you got the ticket.<sup><a href="#footnote-2160" id="footnote-ref-2160">[2160]</a></sup></ul>
<p><strong><em>For OLD infraction tickets</em></strong>, you will need to find out which court or agency is in charge of collecting your fines (see PG. 736) and how much you owe (see PG. 742). Then contact that agency to find out how to pay off your fines.</p>
<p><strong><em>For misdemeanor tickets</em></strong><em>: </em>You will need to go to court in the county where you got the ticket, on the day and time listed on your ticket. The court will tell you how much you owe, and you will make payments to the court. </p>
<p><strong><em>For OLD misdemeanor tickets</em></strong>, you will need to find out which court or agency is in charge of collecting your fines (see PG. 736) and how much you owe (see PG. 742). Then contact that agency to find out how to pay off your fines.</p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Remember, you must pay your fines BEFORE the deadline listed on the ticket or given by the court. If you don’t pay your fines on time, you can be charged <em>double</em> in penalties and your case may be referred to a collection agency. The DMV may also put a hold on your registration or driver license, until you pay your fines.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2161" id="footnote-ref-2161">[2161]</a></sup></strong> </p>

<h4 class="sidebox">A Note ABOUT Traffic TICKETS:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Sometimes it can take several weeks for your ticket to show up in the court’s computer system. If you call the court and they don’t have a record of your ticket yet, don’t be discouraged! You may have to call back again later to get your question answered. </p>
<p class="text">It depends on the type of traffic fine.</p>
<h4>For parking tickets</h4>
<p class="text">Talk to the parking agency (or collection agency, if your parking fines were sent to collections) about setting up a <em>payment plan</em>.

<h4>For misdemeanor and infraction tickets</h4>
<p class="text">A recent change in California law has created a statewide Traffic Amnesty Program to help people who reduce old traffic court debt that qualifies and/or reinstate Driver Licenses suspended due to that old traffic debt. There are eligibility requirements, so keep reading to learn more about this new program.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="COD_TrafficFines_TrafficAmnestyProgram"></a><a id="_Toc448153546"></a>NEW! Traffic Amnesty Program</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153547"></a>What is California’s new Traffic Amnesty Program?</h3>
<p class="text">The Traffic Amnesty Program is a one-time opportunity to reduce overall fines on old traffic tickets that are eligible for the program.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2162" id="footnote-ref-2162">[2162]</a></sup></sup> It applies to not just driving tickets, but any tickets or fines handled in traffic court. This can help you get your California Driver License back if it was suspended for failure to appear in court (called “FTA”),<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2163" id="footnote-ref-2163">[2163]</a></sup></sup> OR for failure to pay traffic tickets/traffic fines (called “FTP”).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2164" id="footnote-ref-2164">[2164]</a></sup></sup>Each county is handling the program slightly differently. It is best to check with the local traffic court in your county for details.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153548"></a>Where do I file for relief under the Traffic Amnesty Program? </h3>
<p class="text">You file for relief for EACH ticket in the traffic court in the county in which your ticket was given.

Other non-traffic infractions that were unrelated to driving could also qualify (like tickets for sleeping on the sidewalk, jaywalking, loitering, or turnstile jumping) but this all depends on the county.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2169" id="footnote-ref-2169">[2169]</a></sup></sup> Some misdemeanors may also qualify depending on your county.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2170" id="footnote-ref-2170">[2170]</a></sup></sup></p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153555"></a>What options do I have to reduce or forgive my court-ordered debt?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on the type of court-ordered debt.</p>
<h4>RESTITUTION</h4>
<p class="text">As we have stated, restitution is mandatory and stays with you for life. However, a judge may order you to do community service instead of paying restitution if he or she finds “compelling and extraordinary reasons” for doing so. Again, your inability to pay is not a compelling or extraordinary reason.<sup><a href="#footnote-2189" id="footnote-ref-2189">[2189]</a></sup></p>
<h4>COURT FINES &amp; PENALTIES AND COURT ADMINISTRATIVE FEES:</h4>
<p class="text">It is often possible to get your fines and fees <em>reduced</em> or <em>forgiven</em> (“<em>vacated</em>”) by the court. However, it depends heavily on what <em>county</em> your debt is from, and which <em>judge</em> is considering your case. In general, judges are more likely to reduce or waive fines and fees if you can show that:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>You’re making an effort to pay your debts</em> (for example, you’re paying restitution, even though you can’t afford to pay the other fines and fees);<em>You’re taking steps toward rehabilitation</em> (for example, you’re in drug treatment or anger management counseling; you’re enrolled in school; you’ve reunited with your family); and<em>You’re following all other conditions of your supervision</em>.</ol>
<p class="text">Here are some ways that you may be able to reduce, forgive, or otherwise satisfy your fines and fees:</p>
<ol class="text">Some courts may allow you to do<em> community service</em> instead of paying your fines and fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2190" id="footnote-ref-2190">[2190]</a></sup> However, there is a lot of variation from county to county, and many counties may not offer community service at all. If the judge did not give you the option of community service at sentencing, you should contact the court or local public defender to ask if the county runs a community service program.The court may allow you to <em>voluntarily</em> choose to do <em>jail time</em> instead of paying your court-ordered fines. You can get your debt reduced by $30/day spent in custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-2191" id="footnote-ref-2191">[2191]</a></sup>You can go to the court directly and ask the judge to forgive (“vacate” or “dismiss”) or reduce your debts.If you get your conviction dismissed, the court can forgive any remaining fines and fees you owe, including restitution <em>fines</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2192" id="footnote-ref-2192">[2192]</a></sup> (but the court CANNOT forgive your victim restitution).<sup><a href="#footnote-2193" id="footnote-ref-2193">[2193]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PAYING YOUR COURT-ORDERED DEBT:<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2194" id="footnote-ref-2194">[2194]</a></sup></strong></p>
<ul class="importantbox"><em>If you owe payments on more than one case</em>, make sure you specify <em>which case</em> AND <em>which fine or fee within that case</em> your payment is for—otherwise the payments may automatically go to your oldest case first.<strong> <sup><a href="#footnote-2195" id="footnote-ref-2195">[2195]</a></sup></strong> Remember, you want to pay off the debts that are <em>conditions of probation</em>, BEFORE paying off any other debts. <em>Try to make small, consistent payments to the court</em>. This shows that you are aware of your debts and are doing your best to pay them off. It may also keep the court from sending your case to collections.<em>If you sign up for a payment plan</em>, make sure to ask about the <em>interest rate</em>, any <em>additional fees</em>, and penalties for missed payments. Collection agencies often add extra fees and interest to your account, which could increase the total amount you have to pay.Keep a list of all payments you make, including the date and time, and who you gave the payment to (the court, county collection agency, FTB, or private collection agency). When you make a payment, always ask for a receipt for the current payment and a print-out of the amount you still owe.</ul>
<h4>TRAFFIC FINES &amp; FEES</h4>
<p class="text">Expenses from traffic fines and fees may seem unimportant if you do not have a car and/or you do not drive frequently. However, remember that these fees (like the other fees discussed in this Chapter) may have a significant impact on your parole or probation conditions and/or finding employment. Because of their impact, it can help to find out if you have any tickets and if you owe any fees, so you can make informed future decisions about how to resolve your debt. </p>

<div class="appendixtitle">Fair Debt Collection Practices &amp;<br/>A Sample Letter to Debt Collection Agency</div>
<p class="text">The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law that prohibits debt collectors from using abusive, unfair, dishonest, or misleading practices to collect money from you. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the federal government’s agency that enforces your rights under the FDCPA.<sup><a href="#footnote-2196" id="footnote-ref-2196">[2196]</a></sup>Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is someone who regularly collects debts owed to others. This includes collection agencies, lawyers who collect debts on a regular basis, and companies that buy overdue debts and then try to collect them.Here are some questions and answers about your rights under the Act.</p>
<h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR CONTACT ME ANY TIME OR ANY PLACE?</h4>
<p class="text">No. A debt collector may not contact you at inconvenient times or places, such as before 8 AM or after 9 PM, unless you agree to it. And collectors may not contact you at work if they’re told (orally or in writing) that you’re not allowed to get calls there.</p>
<h4>HOW CAN I STOP A DEBT COLLECTOR FROM CONTACTING ME?</h4>
<p class="text">If a collector contacts you about a debt, you may want to talk to them at least once to see if you can resolve the matter – even if you don’t think you owe the debt, can’t repay it immediately, or think that the collector is contacting you by mistake. If you decide after contacting the debt collector that you don’t want the collector to contact you again, tell the collector – in writing – to stop contacting you. Here’s how to do that:Write a letter to the debt collector and make a copy of the letter (see PG. 773 below for a sample letter). Send the original by certified mail, and pay for a “return receipt” so you’ll be able to prove that the collector received the letter. Once the collector receives your letter, they may not contact you again, with two exceptions: A collector can contact you to (1) tell you there will be no further contact, or (2) let you know that they or the creditor intend to take a specific action, like filing a lawsuit. Sending such a letter to a debt collector to whom you owe money will NOT get rid of the debt, but it should stop the contact. The creditor or the debt collector still can sue you in court to collect the debt.</p>
<h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR CONTACT ANYONE ELSE ABOUT MY DEBT?</h4>
<p class="text">If an attorney is representing you about the debt, the debt collector must contact the attorney, rather than you. If you don’t have an attorney, a collector may contact other people – but only to find out your address, your home phone number, and where you work. Collectors usually are prohibited from contacting third parties more than once. Other than to obtain this location information about you, a debt collector generally is not permitted to discuss your debt with anyone other than you, your spouse, or your attorney.</p>
<h4>WHAT DOES THE DEBT COLLECTOR HAVE TO TELL ME ABOUT THE DEBT?</h4>
<p class="text">Every collector must send you a written “validation notice” telling you how much money you owe within five days after they first contact you. This notice also must include the name of the creditor to whom you owe the money, and how to proceed if you don’t think you owe the money.</p>
<h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR KEEP CONTACTING ME IF I DON’T THINK I OWE ANY MONEY?</h4>
<p class="text">If you send the debt collector a letter stating that you don’t owe any or all of the money, or asking for verification (proof) of the debt, that collector must stop contacting you. You have to send that letter within 30 days after you receive the validation notice. But a collector can begin contacting you again if it sends you written proof of the debt, like a copy of a bill for the amount you owe.</p>
<h4>WHAT PRACTICES ARE OFF LIMITS FOR DEBT COLLECTORS?</h4>
<p class="text"><strong>Harassment:</strong> Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse you or any third parties they contact. For example, they may not:</p>
<ol class="text">use threats of violence or harm;publish a list of names of people who refuse to pay their debts (but they can give this information to the credit reporting companies);use obscene or profane language; orrepeatedly use the phone to annoy someone.</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>False statements:</strong> Debt collectors may not lie when they are trying to collect a debt. For example, they may not:</p>
<ol class="text">falsely claim that they are attorneys or government representatives;falsely claim that you have committed a crime;falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit reporting company;misrepresent the amount you owe;indicate that papers they send you are legal forms if they aren’t; orindicate that papers they send to you aren’t legal forms if they are.</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>&gt; Debt collectors also are prohibited from saying that</strong>:</p>
<ol class="text">you will be arrested if you don’t pay your debt;they’ll seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages unless they are permitted by law to take the action and intend to do so; orlegal action will be taken against you, if doing so would be illegal or if they don’t intend to take the action.</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>&gt; Debt collectors may not</strong>:</p>
<ol class="text">give false credit information about you to anyone, including a credit reporting company;send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency if it isn’t; oruse a false company name.</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>Unfair practices</strong>: Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, they may not:</p>
<ol class="text">try to collect any interest, fee, or other charge on top of the amount you owe unless the contract that created your debt – or your state law – allows the charge;deposit a post-dated check early;take or threaten to take your property unless it can be done legally; orcontact you by postcard.</ol>
<h4>CAN I CONTROL WHICH DEBTS MY PAYMENTS APPLY TO?</h4>
<p class="text">Yes. If a debt collector is trying to collect more than one debt from you, the collector must apply any payment you make to the debt you select. Equally important, a debt collector may not apply a payment to a debt you don’t think you owe.</p>
<h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR GARNISH MY BANK ACCOUNT OR MY WAGES?</h4>
<p class="text">If you don’t pay a debt, a creditor or its debt collector generally can sue you to collect. If they win, the court will enter a judgment against you. The judgment states the amount of money you owe, and allows the creditor or collector to get a garnishment order against you, directing a third party, like your bank, to turn over funds from your account to pay the debt.Wage garnishment happens when your employer withholds part of your compensation to pay your debts. Your wages usually can be garnished only as the result of a court order. Don’t ignore a lawsuit summons. If you do, you lose the opportunity to fight a wage garnishment.</p>
<h4>CAN MY FEDERAL BENEFITS BE GARNISHED?</h4>
<p class="text">Many federal benefits are exempt from garnishment (meaning they cannot be taken to pay certain debts), including:</p>
<ol class="text">Social Security BenefitsSupplemental Security Income (SSI) BenefitsVeterans’ BenefitsCivil Service and Federal Retirement and Disability BenefitsMilitary Annuities and Survivors’ BenefitsFederal Emergency Management Agency Federal Disaster Assistance</ol>
<p class="text">BUT federal benefits may be garnished under certain circumstances, including to pay delinquent taxes, alimony, child support, or student loans.</p>
<h4>WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS IF I THINK A DEBT COLLECTOR HAS VIOLATED THE LAW?</h4>
<p class="text">You have the right to sue a collector in a state or federal court within one year from the date the law was violated. If you win, the judge can require the collector to pay you for any damages you can prove you suffered because of the illegal collection practices, like lost wages and medical bills. The judge can require the debt collector to pay you up to $1,000, even if you can’t prove that you suffered actual damages. You also can be reimbursed for your attorney’s fees and court costs. A group of people also may sue a debt collector as part of a class action lawsuit and recover money for damages up to $500,000, or one percent of the collector’s net worth, whichever amount is lower. Even if a debt collector violates the FDCPA in trying to collect a debt, the debt does not go away if you owe it.</p>
<h4>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF A DEBT COLLECTOR SUES ME?</h4>
<p class="text">If a debt collector files a lawsuit against you to collect a debt, respond to the lawsuit, either personally or through your lawyer, by the date specified in the court papers to preserve your rights.</p>
<h4>WHERE DO I REPORT A DEBT COLLECTOR FOR AN ALLEGED VIOLATION?</h4>
<p class="text">Report any problems you have with a debt collector to the California Attorney General’s office, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. California has its own debt collection laws that may give you more rights and protections than the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
