  Legal restrictions on certain jobs
</p>

<p>
  Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record? 
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, yes… But this is very rare. Although we don't want to give you bad news, we also want to give you the information you need to decide which jobs will be best for you! There are a few situations when having a criminal record—or having certain types of convictions on your record—will disqualify you from getting certain types of jobs. It is important that you know about these situations beforehand, so that you can realistically set your sights on jobs that you can have. 
</p>

<p>
  Although this list is incomplete, below are some examples of jobs that have legal restrictions for people with certain criminal convictions. In general, these are jobs where you would have access to private or sensitive information (like financial records); vulnerable people (like children or the elderly), or high-security places, where there might be a greater risk of harm to the public.
</p>

<p>
  Airport security screeners (or anyone with unsupervised access to secure airport areas);[1897] 
</p>

<p>
  Federal law enforcement officers;[1898]
</p>

<p>
  Defense contractors;[1899]
</p>

<p>
  Prisoner transportation personnel;[1900]
</p>

<p>
  Port workers;[1901]
</p>

<p>
  Bank employees;[1902]
</p>

<p>
  Insurance personnel;[1903]
</p>

<p>
  Jobs that administer employee benefits plan;[1904]
</p>

<p>
  Childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies;[1905]
</p>

<p>
  Working for a school district in a position that requires certification or a supervisory capacity (if you have been convicted of a felony defined as serious or violent);[1906]
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: Most of the time, if an employer cannot hire a person with a record for certain types of job positions, the employer may still be able to hire that person for other positions. If an employer says that they cannot hire you for a job based on your criminal record, you should ask whether there are any other positions available that you could take instead.
