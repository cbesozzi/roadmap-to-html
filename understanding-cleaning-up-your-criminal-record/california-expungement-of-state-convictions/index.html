          <h4 class="textbox"><em>CA EXPUNGEMENT—A GENERAL OVERVIEW </em></h4>
          <p class="textbox">An expungement of a state conviction (also called a “dismissal”) is a way of <em>cleaning up your record</em> that <em>limits</em> the information that shows up in a <em>background check</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2930" id="footnote-ref-2930">[2896]</a></sup> and can relieve you of some of the consequences associated with your conviction.</p>
          <h4>What expungement does:</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">Prohibits information about the conviction from being included in <em>some</em> <em>background checks</em>;Releases you from most of the “penalties and disabilities” resulting from the conviction;Changes your record to show that the conviction was dismissed (but does NOT remove the offense from your official criminal record (RAP) entirely). </ul>
          <h4>What convictions can be expunged? </h4>
          <ul class="textbox">A conviction may qualify for expungement if:You did NOT spend any time in prison for the offense; ANDYou completed any term of supervision for the offense; ANDYou are NOT currently charged with, serving a sentence for, or on a term of supervision for another offense.<em>Note</em>: Certain convictions are NEVER eligible for expungement.</ul>
          <h4>How do I get an expungement?</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">You must file a petition with the court;You may have a hearing where you will have to persuade a judge that you deserve an expungement;You may have to give the court documents that support your request, such as letters of support, school transcripts, and diplomas or certificates. </ul>
