    What can I do to show mitigating circumstances and rehabilitative evidence related to my criminal record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is a 388 petition?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under Welfare and Institutions Code 388, any parent of a dependent child, a dependent child of the juvenile court (with the assistance of an appointed guardian), or other person having interest in a dependent child of the juvenile court may file a 388 petition when there is a change of circumstance or there is new evidence in their case. For more information on 388 petitions, see Appendix E

    Appendix E on PG. 989.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As stated in the family court section on PG. 922, You can show the judge anything that indicates that giving you custody or visitation will be in the best interests of your child. You can show the judge things like: certificates earned during incarceration, letters to and from your child, letters of support from family and friends, documents that show attendance in self-help groups, proof of employment.[2364] However, if you have a conviction that automatically bans you from getting custody or visitation with your child, then mitigating evidence will not be considered. See PG. 894 for a list of convictions that will automatically bar you from getting custody or visitation.
