          <h4 class="sidebox">ARE YOU UNDOCUMENTED?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">See PG. 58 for options!</p>
          <p class="text">Both a California state ID and a California driver license serve as an official government-issued, photo identification that can be used to prove your identity, age, and legal presence in the United States (unless you have an “undocumented person” California driver license). Either one will allow you to prove your identity, for example, when you open a bank account, register to vote, or apply for jobs, housing, or public benefits. </p>
          <p class="text">If you eventually want to <em>drive</em>, you will need to get a driver license, but because that process requires testing, we recommend that you get a California state ID first, since ID is needed right away after release. Once you get a state ID, you can go back later for a driver license.</p>

          <p class="importantbox"><a id="DL_Undocumented"></a>*** A NOTE IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED:As of January 1, 2015, if you cannot provide proof of legal presence in the United States, but otherwise qualify for a California driver license, you can apply for a “non-ID” driver license. If you hold this license, you can legally drive a motor vehicle in California; but it does not prove legal presence in the United States for any purpose.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-62" id="footnote-ref-62">[61]</a></sup></sup> Read more about other forms of ID in California for undocumented people on PG. 58.</p>
