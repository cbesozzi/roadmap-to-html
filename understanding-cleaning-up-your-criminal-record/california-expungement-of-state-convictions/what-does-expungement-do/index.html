          <h3><a id="_Toc448153910"></a><a id="Expung_Ques_California_expungementDo"></a>What does expungement do?</h3>
          <ol class="text">An expungement makes it so that <em>most</em> private employers CANNOT see the expunged conviction when they run a background check on you. </ol>
          <ol class="text">On job applications for (most) <em>private</em> employers, if you are asked if you have any convictions, you can answer NO.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2935" id="footnote-ref-2935">[2901]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">NOTE: On applications for certain jobs, you MUST report convictions even if they have been expunged. (For more information about who can still see or ask about expunged convictions, see PG. 1163.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Several California cities and counties have passed “Ban the Box” laws that bar employers from asking about convictions on a job application. If you apply for a job in a location with a “Ban the Box” law, the application should not ask about any convictions. For more information on Ban the Box laws, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 706.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Anyone else who does see the expungement will see it as a dismissal instead of a conviction, which is less alarming.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you apply for a professional or occupational license or certification, an expungement can help your chances because it is seen as <em>evidence of rehabilitation</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2936" id="footnote-ref-2936">[2902]</a></sup></sup> (Although the licensing board will still be able to see that there was a conviction that was dismissed.) For more information on licensing and certification, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 706.</ol>
          <ol class="text">An expungement may also be seen as evidence of rehabilitation when you apply for housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2937" id="footnote-ref-2937">[2903]</a></sup></sup> Learn more in the HOUSING CHAPTER, PG. 417).</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you were denied federal student loans because of a drug conviction, you will become eligible again after an expungement.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2938" id="footnote-ref-2938">[2904]</a></sup></sup> For more information about regaining eligibility for federal aid after a drug conviction, see the EDUCATION CHAPTER, on PG. 1083, and EDUCATION CHAPTER: Appendix B, on PG. 1106).</ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you are a non-citizen and you have been convicted of a DUI offense, getting your conviction expunged might have special immigration benefits for you. It’s recommended that you contact a lawyer immediately if you have a DUI and you are a non-citizen. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights runs the Immigration Post-Conviction Relief Project, which is dedicated to helping people in this situation for free. Contact the Lawyer’s Committee by phone at (415) 543-9444 or email at <a href="mailto:info@lccr.com">info@lccr.com</a>. You can also try to find a lawyer to help you from the legal aid list on PG. 1286.</p>
