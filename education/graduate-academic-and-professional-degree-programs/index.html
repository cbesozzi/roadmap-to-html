<h1>Graduate academic and professional degree programs</h1>

<h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153829"></a>Graduate academic and professional degree programs</h2>

<p class="text">These degrees are offered at four-year colleges and universities and at graduate academic and professional schools. You must have a Bachelor’s degree before you can move on to pursue a graduate academic or professional degree. Students studying to earn one of these degrees must take highly advanced and specialized courses in a specific academic or professional field. It generally takes two years of full-time study for a <em>master’s degree, </em>and three to four years of full-time study for a <em>doctorate degree</em>.</p>

<ol class="text">Graduate <span class="emphasisitalic">academic</span> degree programs require advanced study in an academic field. They emphasize theory, as opposed to practical application, with the goal of contributing to the body of knowledge on a subject. Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) are examples of graduate academic degrees. </ol>

<ol class="text">Graduate <span class="emphasisitalic">professional</span> degree programs require advanced study in a professional or vocational field. They emphasize the practical application of knowledge to a professional practice, and are usually required in order to get a license to work in that profession.<sup><a href="#footnote-2836" id="footnote-ref-2836">[2803]</a></sup> Master of Engineering (M.E.) and Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) are examples of graduate professional degrees. </ol>
