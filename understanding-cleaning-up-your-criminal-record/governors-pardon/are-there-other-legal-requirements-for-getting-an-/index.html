  <p>
    Are there other legal requirements for getting an arrest record sealed?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. In order to have your arrest record sealed, you must fit into one of the following situations:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are found to be “Factually Innocent”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were arrested but:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were never charged;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your charges were dismissed;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were acquitted at trial; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were convicted, but your conviction was set aside.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    AND you meet the following requirements:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A judge finds you “factually innocent” of the charges for which you were arrested. A person is considered “factually innocent” when a court finds that “no reasonable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense for which the arrest was made;”[3123] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were an adult when you were arrested. (If you were a juvenile when you were arrested, see PG. 1196 for information on cleaning up juvenile records);[3124]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The arrest was for a misdemeanor or felony (NOT an infraction);[3125] AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were not convicted of any other crime connected to that same arrest.[3126]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were Ordered to do a Diversion Program
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were arrested AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DA offered you a diversion program instead of charging you; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were charged, but the judge sent you to a diversion program.
