  <p>
    How SSI affects your ability to get other public benefits:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you get SSI, you can’t also get CalFresh, since SSI is supposed to cover food expenses.[1621] However, other people in your household may be eligible and your income will not count in determining their eligibility. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you get SSI, you’ll be automatically enrolled in Medi-Cal (see PG. 538) and may qualify for extra help with paying for Medicare (see PG. 547). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SSI recipients who do not have access to a kitchen or have a kitchen but no stove or refrigerator are eligible for additional food benefits through SSI. You are not considered as having access to a kitchen unless you have a working refrigerator or icebox and a stove with at least two working burners.[1622] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Depending on your work history, you may be eligible to get retirement benefits (see PG. 557) and/or SSDI (see PG. 581) in addition to SSI.[1623]
