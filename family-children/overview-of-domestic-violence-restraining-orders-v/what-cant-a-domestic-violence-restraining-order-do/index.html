  <h2><a href="/family-children/overview-of-domestic-violence-restraining-orders-v/what-cant-a-domestic-violence-restraining-order-do/index.html">What can’t a domestic violence restraining order do?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What can’t a domestic violence restraining order do?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A restraining order cannot:[2513]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    End your marriage or domestic partnership. It is NOT a divorce. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Establish parentage (paternity) of your children with the restrained person (if you are not married to, or in a domestic partnership with, him or her) UNLESS you and the restrained person agree to parentage of your child or children and agree to the court entering a judgment about parentage. You can read and use Agreement and Judgment of Parentage (Form DV-180) (see Appendix I, PG. 1009 for the form) to do this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     I have a restraining order against me. what must i do?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have a restraining order against you, there are things you may not be able to do, for example:[2514]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Go to certain places,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do certain things, 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Live in certain areas,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit or contact your children,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit or contact your current or former partner,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Own a gun or any other types of weapons 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The restraining order may also affect your immigration status. If you are worried about this, talk to an immigration lawyer to find out if you will be affected.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What you can/can’t do, and whom you can/can’t see or visit, will be specifically outlined in the restraining order. Read it carefully!
