        <h1>What type of ID can I get if I am undocumented?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc328831288"></a>What type of ID can I get if I am undocumented?</h3>
        <p class="textbox">You may be able to get one of these limited forms of ID, which can be used for some but not all purposes:<strong>Consular Identification Cards (CIDs):</strong> Some governments issue CID cards to identify their citizens who are living in foreign countries. CID cards can be issued to people who are undocumented or documented in the foreign county. See Appendix IH, PG. 128, for a list of countries that issue CIDs. If you are a citizen of one of these countries, visit the nearest consulate to obtain your CID card. In the United States, CID cards can be a helpful ID document as you try to get a driver license, open a bank account, show proof of identity to police, and access other services. For example, in California, you can use a Mexican CID to get a driver license. However, CIDs do not grant you legal presence in the United States or other privileges.<sup><a href="#footnote-202" id="footnote-ref-202">[202]</a></sup> <strong>Municipal IDs:</strong> A handful of California cities have begun issuing municipal (“city”) ID cards for their residents. You can use these to get access to city services and benefits. More importantly, they are considered a form of identification by local officials and may provide evidence to get other forms of ID. Additionally, these forms of ID do not require proof of citizenship or legal presence of any kind.</p>
        <ul class="textbox"><strong><em>San Francisco City ID Card — </em></strong>Photo ID card for San Francisco residents to get access to city programs and connect to local businesses. It proves identity and city residency; and it can be used as a public library card and to access other city services.
