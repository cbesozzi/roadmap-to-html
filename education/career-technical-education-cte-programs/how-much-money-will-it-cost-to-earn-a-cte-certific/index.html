          <p class="text">In a federal prison,<sup><a href="#footnote-2771" id="footnote-ref-2771">[2738]</a></sup> California state prison,<sup><a href="#footnote-2772" id="footnote-ref-2772">[2739]</a></sup> or California county jail,<sup><a href="#footnote-2773" id="footnote-ref-2773">[2740]</a></sup> any CTE programs available should be provided at no cost to you (including necessary materials and credentialing fees). </p>
          <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> While CTE programs are generally offered at no cost, if you have a high balance in your trust account, your facility may decide to deduct some or all of the cost of the program from your account.<sup><a href="#footnote-2774" id="footnote-ref-2774">[2741]</a></sup> </p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re formerly incarcerated: </div>
          <p class="text">Your costs will vary based on your school, program, and course load. If you’re a resident of the state where you enroll, the cheapest options will likely be programs offered at community colleges or technical colleges, which are public schools. Average tuition and fees per year are about $4,000 for in-state students at public 2-year colleges, compared to about $15,000 at private 2-year colleges.<sup><a href="#footnote-2775" id="footnote-ref-2775">[2742]</a></sup> (See PG. 1043 for tips on avoiding private schools that may be scams.)</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some schools and programs offer financial aid for low-income students. Check with each school and program about overall costs, fee waivers, and financial aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-2776" id="footnote-ref-2776">[2743]</a></sup> For more information on fee waivers and financial aid, see Paying for Your Education, starting on PG. 1082.</p>

          <div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re currently incarcerated…</div>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a federal prison: </span>Every federal prison offers a different range of Occupational Education (OE) programs, which may include certificate programs as well as programs leading to associate’s degrees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2777" id="footnote-ref-2777">[2744]</a></sup> Soon after you enter prison, your Unit Team and Education Staff should give you an assessment and recommend programs for you. If you have no stable work history or training record, you may be assigned to an OE program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2778" id="footnote-ref-2778">[2745]</a></sup> If you haven’t been assigned to an OE program and would like to be, ask your Unit Team to place you in one. Your Unit Team will decide what OE course(s) may be right for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2779" id="footnote-ref-2779">[2746]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text"><em>Notes on eligibility &amp; timing:</em> Certain OE programs may be open to you only if you have a high school credential or are working toward one.<sup><a href="#footnote-2780" id="footnote-ref-2780">[2747]</a></sup> Also, if you need job training but spaces are limited, you might not be placed in an OE program until the last several months of your sentence, to ensure that your training is current when you’re released.<sup><a href="#footnote-2781" id="footnote-ref-2781">[2748]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a California state prison: </span>Every CDCR facility provides a different range of CTE programs, all accredited by a nationally recognized agency. (For information on accreditation, see PG. 1043.) Since these CTE programs are properly accredited, you should be able to transfer credits from these programs to a college degree program. (For information on transferring credits, see PG. 1076.) There are no eligibility or testing requirements for CTE programs in CDCR facilities, but you will be limited by what programs your facility has available.<sup><a href="#footnote-2782" id="footnote-ref-2782">[2749]</a></sup> Ask your Correctional Counselor about what CTE programs are offered and how you can sign up. </p>
          <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE ON THE TRANSITIONS PROGRAM:</strong><em> </em>Some CDCR facilities offer the Transitions Program, which is a 4-5 week program that provides job readiness and money management skills, information about community programs, and connections to social services in the county where you’ll be living. If your facility has this program and you’re eligible, you may be assigned to participate at some point during the last 6 months before your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2783" id="footnote-ref-2783">[2750]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a California county jail: </span>Because programs vary greatly across county facilities, you will need to check with your facility’s education department to see if CTE programs are available. </p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re formerly incarcerated</div>
          <p class="text">CTE programs are offered at community and technical colleges as well as four-year colleges. To find CTE programs in your area: </p>
          <ol class="text">Check your local public library for information about CTE programs, adult schools, and colleges in your area. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Search on the Internet for nearby schools and programs. The following websites are good starting points:</ol>

          <h3><a id="_Toc448153793"></a>How do I choose a CTE program? </h3>
          <p class="text">If you want to make an informed decision, it’s important to research the qualifications required for the jobs you want, the quality of the schools you’re considering, and the current state of the job market.<sup><a href="#footnote-2784" id="footnote-ref-2784">[2751]</a></sup> (For tips on researching the qualifications you need for the specific job(s) you want, see Setting Your Goals, PG. 1035.) When you know what skills and training you need, you can begin evaluating individual CTE programs to find the one that is right for you. If you have decided that a CTE program is the best path for you, see Choosing Your Education Path, PG. 1043, for tips on evaluating and choosing a program.</p>
