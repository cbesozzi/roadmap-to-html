<h1>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</h1>

<p>
  Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
</p>

<p>
  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provides financial support for low-income people who are 65 years old or older and/or have a disability—regardless of work history. The federal government provides certain amounts of aid for people who qualify, and California adds to the federal amounts in certain cases. SSI benefits are meant to cover basic necessities like food, clothing and shelter.[1611]
</p>

<p>
  Am I eligible for SSI? 
</p>

<p>
  To be able to get SSI, you must:
</p>

<p>
  Be at least age 65, or blind, or disabled;
</p>

<p>
  For SSI purposes, a disability is a severe medical condition that prevents you from being able to work.[1612] This is the same definition used for SSDI, and the same process is used to decide whether you have a qualifying disability.[1613] 
</p>

<p>
  Have very little or no income;
</p>

<p>
  The income limit varies by where you live and may change from year to year.[1614]
</p>

<p>
  Own limited resources;[1615]
</p>

<p>
  The resource limit means that the value of things you own (besides your home and your car) must be below a certain amount, which is set by law and differs for singled and married people.[1616] 
</p>

<p>
  You must be living in the U.S. as a citizen or a lawfully present non-citizen (LPR);[1617]
</p>

<p>
  If you are ineligible for SSI due to residency status, but you are legally present, you may be eligible for the Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI).[1618] For information about this program, see the Helpful Hint box below.
</p>

<p>
  You must apply for any other cash benefits you might be eligible for; and[1619] 
</p>

<p>
  You must not be currently incarcerated (details below).[1620] 
</p>

<p>
  Helpful HintCash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI)
</p>

<p>
  CAPI is a state-funded program that provides monthly cash benefits (similar to SSI) for aged, blind, and disabled non-citizens who are ineligible for SSI/SSP solely due to their immigrant status. CAPI Eligibility: To be eligible for CAPI, you must:Fill out an application in the county welfare office Be a lawfully present noncitizen Meet all other SSI/SSP eligibility requirements (except for immigration status)Be ineligible for SSI/SSP solely due to immigration status For more information on CAPI, call your local SSA office (listing of SSA offices available at: https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp or visit: http://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/PG42.htm
