  <h2><a href="/parole-probation/additional-laws-that-apply-to-all-people-on-state-/what-is-my-parole-plan/index.html">What is my parole plan?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What is my parole plan?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your parole plan is an individualized plan to guide your supervision, which DAPO staff will prepare before your release, based on an individual evaluation of your strengths, needs, risk factors, and overall risk of reoffending. Your parole plan will include information identified in your evaluation —your strengths, needs, risk factors, and overall risk of reoffending — as well as goals for your successful reentry; “triggers” that may lead to negative behavior; strategies for avoiding “triggers”; special parole conditions; and your supervision category.[443] Your supervision category is based on DAPO’s initial evaluation of your risk of reoffending, as well as your progress while on parole.[444]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should receive a copy of your parole plan before you are released. While you are on parole, you should be meeting regularly with your parole agent to review your parole plan, your progress with specific goals and strategies, and other issues. Your parole agent will modify (adjust) your parole plan based on your progress and other changes in your situation.[445] Your parole agent should also review your supervision category periodically to determine whether it should be changed.[446] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Victims and witnesses of your crime can ask for special parole conditions to be imposed on you, including no-contact provisions and/or requirements that you are not paroled to the county where they live (for more information, see PG. 195).[447] BPH and CDCR also commonly impose special no-contact provisions for crime partners, which would prevent you from contacting/seeing anyone who was your co-defendant in your criminal case. Lastly, state law requires special conditions for certain categories of people — these are called mandatory special conditions.[448] Specifically, there are mandatory special conditions for “sex offenders” (see PG. 182) and for “mentally disordered offenders” (see PG. 187). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What are common examples of special parole conditions? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The most common special conditions for a person on state parole are:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You cannot drink alcohol; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must submit to drug testing; or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must participate in mental health treatment.[449] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GPS DEVICES — Some people on parole will be required to wear GPS tracking devices (usually ankle monitors). It is the CDCR’s policy to require GPS monitoring for: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any parolee validated as a member or associate of a prison gang, street gang, or “disruptive group”;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any parolee placed on “high control” supervision; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any parolee with a history of being unavailable for supervision, absconding (going missing), escalating parole violations, or other such factors indicating the parolee is likely to commit another crime; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any parolee required by the BPH to have a GPS monitoring condition.[450] Failure to wear the GPS device or to keep it charged is a violation of parole.[451] Parolees can be required to pay for the cost of the GPS if they are able to do so.[452]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When will I find out the conditions of my parole, including any special conditions that apply to me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your parole may be revoked for 6 months if you (1) refuse to give any required DNA sample prior to release, or (2) refuse to sign any documents acknowledging a duty to register as a sex offender. (See Cal. Penal Code § 3060.5). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WHILE INCARCERATED:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should find out about the conditions of your parole at least 45 days before your release. Your correctional counselor should provide you with this information in a CDCR Form 1515: Notice and Conditions of Parole.[453] You will be asked to sign the Form 1515.[454] You will also be given a copy of the Form 1515 for you to keep upon your release. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even if you don't agree with a special condition listed in the Form 1515, it is usually best to sign the Form 1515 and comply with the conditions while at the same time taking steps to challenge any disputed condition. If you don't sign the form, you might not get out of prison until the matter is resolved.[455] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ONCE YOU’RE RELEASED:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you are out and you first meet with your parole agent, he or she should give you a copy of your Form 1515 to keep, and he or she should explain ALL the general and special conditions of your parole.[456] It is important that you fully understand your parole conditions. If you do not understand some or all of them, ask your parole agent to clear up your questions or concerns.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your parole agent doesn’t present you with the Form 1515 in your first meeting, you should ask him or her to do so. Again, it is very important that your parole agent explains to you all your conditions of parole — and if he or she does not do so, you should ask.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do I have any legal protections against unfair special parole conditions? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. A parole condition is invalid if it fails one of the following 4 legal tests:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It has no relation to the commitment offense; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities.[457] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For this test, you must show that the condition is invalid based on all three of these factors. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example: Courts have held that if a parolee has no history of alcohol abuse or committing crimes while intoxicated, alcohol testing cannot be imposed as a condition of parole because using alcohol (1) is unrelated to the parolee’s past criminal conduct, (2) is not illegal in itself, and (3) is not reasonably related to the parolee’s risk of future criminality.[458]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.[459] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TEST 3: A parole condition may be invalid if it is excessively broad or so vague that you cannot understand or follow it.[460] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example: If a parole condition prohibits you from associating with members of a certain group, then to be valid, it must include a requirement that you actually know (or should know) whether the people you’re associating with are members of the prohibited group.[461]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TEST 4: A parole condition is invalid if it limits the type of employment you can have, and this limitation does not directly relate to your crime.[462] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example: If you were previously convicted for bouncing a check, a parole condition that forbids you from becoming a salesperson would be invalid.[463]
