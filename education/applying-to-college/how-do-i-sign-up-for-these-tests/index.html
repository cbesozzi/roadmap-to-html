  <p>
    How do I sign up for these tests?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WHAT IF I CAN’T TAKE IT BECAUSE I AM INCARCERATEd?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are unable to take the SAT or ACT while you are incarcerated, you can still study and prepare for either test so that you are ready to be tested as soon as you are released. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The SAT has no established procedure for allowing people who are incarcerated to take the test. You should check with your facility’s Education Department to see if you can arrange to take the SAT.[2783] On the other hand, the ACT specifically allows people who are incarcerated to register for and take the test. This is called “arranged testing.” To ask for arranged testing, you will need to get and submit ACT’s “Request for Arranged Testing” form. You can get a copy of this form by calling the ACT Arranged Testing Line at 319-337-1510 or by writing to: ACT Arranged Testing, 301 ACT Drive, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, IA 52243-0168.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This form is also available online at http://www.actstudent.org/faq/confined.html (if you have someone who can download it for you).[2784] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SAT—You can register online at http://sat.collegeboard.org/register/.[2785] You can also request a paper registration form by writing to: College Board SAT Program P.O. Box 025505 Miami, FL 33102, or by calling (866) 756-7346.[2786] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ACT—You can register online at http://www.actstudent.org/regist/,[2787] You can also request a Register-By-Mail packet by writing to: ACT Student Services, 2727 Scott Blvd., minizip 46, P.O. Box 414, Iowa City, IA 52243-0414 or by calling (319) 337-1270 (See Appendix C, PG. 1099, for more details on ACT policies.).

  <p>
    How do I prepare for the SAT or the ACT? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated…
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check your facility’s library for SAT and ACT test preparation guides and materials. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The College Board (the company that makes the SAT) offers free sample tests and questions for study preparation. You can request these materials by writing to: College Board SAT Program, P.O. Box 025505, Miami, FL 33102 or by calling SAT Program Customer Service at (866) 756-7346.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ACT offers a free guide for preparing for the test. You can request a copy by writing to: ACT Student Services, 2727 Scott Blvd., minizip 46, P.O. Box 414, Iowa City, IA 52243-0414 or by calling ACT at (319) 337-1270. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can purchase test preparation guides and materials for both tests from approved online venders such as amazon.com and Barnes & Noble. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check your local library for SAT and ACT test preparation guides and materials. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also buy these guides at almost any bookstore and from online retailers such as amazon.com. You can also check used bookstores that may sell previous versions of these guides at a discount. (NOTE: These tests are constantly changed and updated. To make sure that you’re studying the right material, do not buy guides that are more than a couple of years out of date.) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free SAT resources, including practice tests and questions, are available online at www.sat.collegeboard.org/practice/.

    Letters of Recommendation
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Letters of recommendation positively describe your character traits, accomplishments, and qualifications, and recommend that you be accepted to a program, school, or job. They can be written by past employers, case managers, supervisors, community leaders, or teachers (but not your family members). They should include each person’s relationship to you, company name and job title, and contact information.[2788]
