        <h3><a id="_Toc448153782"></a>What is an adult high school diploma program? How can it help me?</h3>
        <p class="text">These diploma programs are for adults who didn‚Äôt finish high school, and who want to complete the courses normally required for high school graduation (instead of taking a GED or high school equivalency test).<sup><a href="#footnote-2747" id="footnote-ref-2747">[2714]</a></sup> High school diploma programs are offered in most jails and prisons, and in adult schools and community colleges throughout California.<sup><a href="#footnote-2748" id="footnote-ref-2748">[2715]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">In most adult high school diploma programs, you can choose to enroll in traditional classes, or to complete courses at your own pace through individual study and regular check-ins with teachers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2749" id="footnote-ref-2749">[2716]</a></sup> In addition, some programs also allow you to complete correspondence courses through mail or email with teachers (for details on distance learning, see PG.¬†1076; for correspondence programs, see PG.¬†1079). After completing all of the required courses, you will have to pass an ‚Äúexit‚Äù exam, called the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) to receive your high school diploma.<sup><a href="#footnote-2750" id="footnote-ref-2750">[2717]</a></sup> All students in California public schools must pass the CAHSEE before they are awarded a high school diploma. This includes people who earn their diploma while incarcerated. </p>
