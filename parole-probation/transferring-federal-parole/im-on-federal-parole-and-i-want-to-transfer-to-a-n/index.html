  <p>
    I’m on federal parole and I want to transfer to a new district. How can I do that?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Improving your chances of having a TRANSFER request approved
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your request is much more likely to be approved if you have a good track record – clean drug tests, always going to your meetings with your Probation Officer, staying out of trouble with law enforcement. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To transfer districts, you need to discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of both the Probation Officer from the transferring district and from the receiving district. You can only transfer if it doesn’t go against the instructions from the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC).[941] If you meet the criteria, have your plan approved, and sign the required forms and submit a transfer request through the Interstate Compact Offender Tracking System (ICOTS), your transfer request will then be submitted to the other state for investigation and a decision on acceptance or rejection. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Please read the next question for more information about transferring between states.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am on federal parole and want to transfer to another state. How can I do that? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision governs transferring between states for adults under all types of community supervision.[942] The Compact has been adopted by all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.[943] An Interstate Commission has developed rules for transfer eligibility and supervision. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To see a full list of rules for interstate transfer can be found here: http://www.interstatecompact.org/Portals/0/library/legal/ICAOS_Rules.pdf.[944]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At the discretion of the sending state, you are eligible and can be approved for transfer if you meet the following criteria:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have more than 90 calendar days or an indefinite period of supervision remaining at the time the sending state transmits the transfer request; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a valid plan of supervision; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are in substantial compliance with the terms of supervision in the sending state (meaning you have not had your probation or parole revoked and you have no pending revocation charges); and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Either:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are a resident of the receiving state, OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have family in the receiving state who indicate a willingness and ability to assist (as specified in your supervision plan) and you can obtain employment in the receiving state or have some other means of support.[945]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are approved for transfer by the sending state, then the receiving state must accept you for federal parole supervision.[946] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ALTERNATIVE OPTION: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even if you do not meet the above criteria and eligibility requirements for interstate parole transfer, the sending and receiving states may also agree to transfer you if there is good cause to do so. To pursue this option:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 1: Discuss the transfer with your Probation Officer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 2: If the special circumstances and good cause for transferring your supervision are approved, the sending state must provide the receiving state enough documentation to justify the transfer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 3: The receiving state shall have the discretion to accept or reject the transfer of supervision in a manner consistent with the purpose of the Interstate Compact.[947]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I start the process?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To get the process started, you should talk to your federal correctional counselor or federal probation agent. The parole agent should determine whether you meet the eligibility criteria. If the criteria are met, the agent should submit a transfer application to the department’s Interstate Compact Unit (In California, the CDCR’s Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento). If that unit approves your application, the request will be sent to the receiving state.[948] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How long will it take?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The earliest that your supervising agency can send a transfer request is 120 days before your expected release date from prison.[949] The receiving state is supposed to respond within 45 calendar days of receiving a transfer request.[950] The process can be expedited in an emergency.[951]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am classified as a sex offender and want to transfer to another state. How can I do that? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must meet the above 5 criteria, AND you must be able to meet additional specific requirements for transferring the supervision of people classified as sex offenders.[952]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: You cannot leave the sending state until the receiving state has approved the transfer request or issued reporting instructions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Follow these steps:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 1: Discuss your desire to transfer with your U.S. Probation Officer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 2: Satisfy all of the eligibility criteria. At the discretion of the sending state, you are eligible and can be approved for transfer if you meet the following criteria and all 5 of the criteria above (see previous page).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 3: Complete an Application for Transfer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 4: The sending state must send the receiving state:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Assessment information, including sex offender specific assessments;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Social history;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Information relevant to the sex offender’s criminal sexual behavior
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Law enforcement report that provides specific details of sex offense;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Victim information: including the name, sex, age and relationship to the offender and the statement of the victim or victim’s representative;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The sending state’s current or recommended supervision and treatment plan.[953]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 5: The receiving state has 5 business days to review the proposed residence. If the proposed residence is not acceptable due to existing state law or policy, the receiving state may deny the application. No travel permit can be granted by the sending state until the receiving state says it can.[954]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 6: A travel permit will be given to you by your Probation Officer if the receiving state has approved the new residence. Travel permits are issued by the local parole office, so each office uses a different form. Your Probation Officer will give you this form once you have been approved by the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.[955]
