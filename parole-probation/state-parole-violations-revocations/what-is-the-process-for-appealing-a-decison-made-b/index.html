  <p>
    What is the process for appealing a decison made by CDCR?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can challenge a CDCR action or lack of action in these stages by filling out a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal (see Appendix J, PG. 311 for copy of form) and submitting it to the CDCR’s parole agent. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possible uses for a 602 appeal include challenging the CDCR’s decision to place a parole hold or find probable cause for a violation, asking for an attorney for the early stage of the revocation process, or challenging a delay by CDCR in filing a formal petition.[592]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two reasons for filing a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal and re-filing it to the highest level necessary:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First reason—It might solve the problem.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Second reason—Courts usually require you to “exhaust administrative remedies” (meaning that you pursued all three levels administrative review before filing a case in court) and that you filed an appeal before filing a lawsuit in court claiming that the CDCR violated your legal rights.[593]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After completing any required administrative remedies, you can challenge a CDCR or BPH action or decision by filing a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus. If the judge issues an “order to show cause,” it must appoint a free lawyer to represent you if you request one and show that you do not have enough money to pay for a private lawyer.[594] See Appendix K, PG. 314 for information on when and how to file a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

    COUNTY PROBATION and NEW FORMS OF COUNTY-LEVEL SUPERVISION
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WHAT WILL I LEARN?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How California’s “Realignment” law changed county-level probation and supervision The different types of county-level supervision: informal probation, formal probation, post-release community supervision, and mandatory supervision Terms and conditions of probation and supervision How to request a change to your probation or supervision conditions How to request a transfer to a different county What to do if your probation or supervision is revoked What happens at a probation revocation hearingHow to challenge probation conditions How to challenge probation revocation
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For certain state convictions, the judge may sentence you to a form of county-level supervision as part (or all) of your sentence. This can happen in a few different ways: types of state crimes, you will either be:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be sentenced to serve some time in county jail, followed by a term on county probation or on California’s new Mandatory Supervision; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be sentenced to serve time in state prison, followed by a term on California’s new Post-Release Community Supervision; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be sentenced directly to a term of just probation (without any time served in jail).

  <p>
    What is county probation? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Probation is a suspended state prison or county jail sentence.[595] In other words, instead of doing the full amount of time in custody (in prison or jail), you can stay in the community under supervision and be required to follow certain rules and conditions.[596] The primary purpose of probation is rehabilitation.[597] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All probation sentences are different. However, there are some standard conditions that apply to most, if not all, people on county-level probation in California. If you have a disability, you should get certain accommodations on probation, so make sure you see PG. 198 to learn about requesting the accommodation(s) you need. Each county is responsible for running its own probation department, and each of these departments has its own specific rules. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How did California’s “Realignment” law change California’s probation System?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Realignment law (“AB 109”) fundamentally changed sentencing law and created new forms of community supervision in California. Because of prison overcrowding, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered California to reduce the number of people it was holding in state prisons. To do this, California decided to keep only people convicted of certain serious felonies in prison. For people convicted of felonies that are “non-serious” and “non-violent,” California transferred responsibility from the state prisons and parole board to the county jails and probation departments. This means that: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted after October 1, 2011, of a felony that falls within the Realignment definition of non-serious, non-violent, and non-sexual (the 3 “nons” or “non-non-non”), you will serve your time in county jail instead of state prison. (You also must not have any prior serious, violent or sexual felony convictions.) Under Realignment, you may also be allowed to serve some of your sentence on community supervision, instead of spending the full term in custody.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted of a “non-non-non” with no priors before October 11, 2011, and you are serving your sentence in prison, you will be put on county-level supervision (PRCS) instead of state parole when you are released.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are the 4 types of community supervision after Realignment: (1) informal probation (also known as “summary” or “court” probation); (2) formal probation; (3) post-release community supervision (PRCS) (new after Realignment) and (4) mandatory supervision (new after Realignment).
