<p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

<h2><a id="_Toc290125846"></a><a id="PublicBenefits_Introduction"></a><a id="_Toc448153255"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153256"></a>What are public benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">“Public benefits” are government programs that ensure people can get basic life necessities. Public benefits are also sometimes referred to as “welfare,” or “welfare benefits.” There are public benefits programs to help people get food, shelter, healthcare, childcare, cash for day-to-day expenses, and support in emergencies. To qualify for any public benefits program, you have to meet certain requirements. Each benefits program works a little differently and has different rules and requirements in place. Depending on your situation, you may qualify for several kinds of public benefits, just one, or none. This section explains what the main public benefits programs offer, which ones you may qualify for, and how to get them.<sup><a href="#footnote-1328" id="footnote-ref-1328">[1328]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125847"></a><a id="_Toc448153257"></a>What should I know about federal, state, and county benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">The federal (national) government is in charge of certain public benefits programs that operate across the country; and the state and county governments are in charge of others that are specific to their own residents:</p>
<ol class="text">For some benefits programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), the federal government sets all the rules about who can receive benefits and how they get issued, requiring agencies in every state and county to follow those rules when distributing those benefits. For example: If you are a person with a disability and no income, and you want to apply for SSI benefits, you have to follow the same rules and meet the same requirements no matter what state or county you live in.For other benefits programs, such as cash assistance, the federal government sets only very general rules, allowing state and county governments to set up their own systems for distributing those benefits to their residents. For example, if you’re a California resident struggling to cover your living costs and want to apply for cash aid through the General Assistance or General Relief (GA/GR) programs, the rules are set by California and your specific county.<sup><a href="#footnote-1329" id="footnote-ref-1329">[1329]</a></sup>For other benefits programs, such as healthcare, the federal government sets up a general system for low-income people (Medicaid) and requires agencies in every state and county to follow those national rules—but also allows states and counties to set more specific rules for their residents and run their own benefits programs for residents who don’t qualify under the federal rules.<sup><a href="#footnote-1330" id="footnote-ref-1330">[1330]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">It is important to know what government agency runs your public benefits—who sets the program rules, as well as which agency you apply and report to.</p>
<p class="widetableintroitalcaps">This chart describes the most common types of public benefits programs, and what they can provide to people who qualify. Whether you qualify depends on many individual factors.</p>

<h3><a id="_Toc290125848"></a><a id="_Toc448153258"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get public benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends. With some benefits programs, there are no rules or requirements related to criminal histories, so you can and should apply to these programs. You can even apply for certain benefits while you are still in prison or jail. But with other benefits programs, there are rules that may disqualify you based on your criminal history. Some programs may limit or deny your access to benefits if you have a certain kind of criminal conviction (a criminal offense you were found guilty of); a parole/probation violation; certain kinds of unpaid fines, fees or debts; or an outstanding warrant. Different programs will have different rules and requirements about these issues. Some programs also impose different restrictions based on what your conviction or violation was, how long ago it was, and how many other convictions or violations you have had.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125849"></a><a id="_Toc448153259"></a>Can I apply for public benefits while I’m incarcerated?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends. For some benefits, <em>yes</em>, you can and should! Depending on where you’re incarcerated, there may be special staff or programs in your facility to help you apply for health care, disability support, and other benefits. Often, you can’t start receiving the benefits while you’re still incarcerated—but by signing up before your release, you can ensure you’ll have access to those benefits soon after you get out. This manual will provide information about the programs where this is possible.</p>

<h4 class="sidebox">FIND MORE BENEFITS!</h4>
<p class="sidebox">More information about what benefits are available to you and how to apply can best be found by looking up your county welfare agency. This can be found by visiting: <a href="http://www.cwda.org/links/chsa.php">http://www.cwda.org/links/chsa.php</a>. </p>

<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc290125851"></a><a id="_Toc448153261"></a><a id="PublicBenefits_GeneralAssistRelief"></a>General Assistance/General Relief (GA/GR)</h1>
<p class="text">General Assistance and General Relief (GA/GR) provide cash assistance to adults who have little money, no sources of support, and who are not currently receiving any other public benefits. Every county in California runs its own GA or GR program, referred to in some counties (mostly in Northern California) as General Assistance (GA) and in other counties (mostly in Southern California) as General Relief (GR). <a id="_Toc290125852"></a></p>
<a id="_Toc448153262"></a>
<h3>Am I eligible for GA/GR?</h3>
<h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintWhat’s the difference between<br/>General Assistance (GA)/General Relief (GR) &amp; CalWORKS?</h4>
<p class="textbox">General Assistance/General Relief is designed to assist needy single adults. The typical General Assistance/General Relief recipient is a low-income single person who has limited resources and does not receive any other Public Benefits. The typical CalWORKS recipients are low-income families with minor children who may also receive other Public Benefits.</p>
<p class="text">In general, to be able to get General Assistance/General Relief, you must: </p>
<ol class="text">Be at least age 18 (unless you are an emancipated foster child denied aid through CalWORKs);Be a resident of the county where you’re applying;Be a U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resident, or an immigrant with satisfactory status; Have a Social Security Number (a card is not necessary); andHave limited income and property.</ol>
<p class="text"><a id="_Toc290728744"></a>Every county has its own rules, including specific limits on the income and property you can have. Contact your county welfare agency for more details. For a list of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A on PG. 556.<sup><a href="#footnote-1331" id="footnote-ref-1331">[1331]</a></sup> When applying for GA/GR, you should bring whatever form of identification you have. If you do not have any ID, the social worker at the county welfare agency should be able to help you in proving your identity. Some counties also require a fingerprint be taken before benefits can be distributed. For information about applying for a California State ID card for free or reduced price, see the BUILDING BLOCKS IN REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, on PG. 46. If you have more questions about applying for GA/GR, you may call the following nonprofit organizations: Public Interest Law Project (PILP) at (510) 891-9794 or the Western Center on Law and Poverty (WCLP) at (213) 487-7211, for advice.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125853"></a><a id="_Toc448153263"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get GA/GR? </h3>
<p class="text"><a id="_Toc290728745"></a>Maybe. Some counties have special rules and restrictions for people with drug-related criminal convictions or other violations, or for people who are suspected of having a warrant, being in violation of parole or probation, or fleeing to avoid prosecution for a crime. Contact your county welfare agency to ask about its local policy. For a directory of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A, PG. 556.<sup><a href="#footnote-1332" id="footnote-ref-1332">[1332]</a></sup> If you believe that your county welfare agency is wrongly or unlawfully denying GA/GR benefits to you, you may call the following nonprofit organizations: Public Interest Law Project (PILP) at (510) 891-9794 or the Western Center on Law and Poverty (WCLP) at (213) 487-7211, for advice. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125854"></a><a id="_Toc448153264"></a>What benefits and services can I get through GA/GR?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on your county.<em> </em>Every county offers different benefits and services through GA/GR, and every county sets its own specific rules. Generally, every county’s GA/GR program provides a monthly cash amount. But remember that the rules vary by county:</p>
<ol class="text">Each county has its own rules for calculating a person’s monthly GA/GR amount—typically based on factors like whether you’re married, your housing situation, disabilities, ability to work, and ability to apply for other public benefits programs.Some counties’ GA/GR programs provide help with: Transportation costs;</ol>
<h4 class="sidebox">SPECIAL RULES &amp; RESTRICTIONS</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Some counties may have special rules and restrictions for people with drug-related convictions or other violations, or people who are suspected of having a warrant, being in violation of parole or probation, or fleeing to avoid prosecution. For example, in Los Angeles County, you are ineligible for GA/GR if you are on house arrest. Other counties, such as San Francisco, make eligibility determinations on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<ol class="text">Health care and nutrition needs;Substance abuse treatment referrals;Emergency food and housing;Housing repairs; and/orPersonal hygiene products.</ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: GA or GR – a GRANT versus a LOANSome counties provide GA/GR cash as a “grant” (a gift), with no strings attached; other counties provide GA/GR as a “loan.” If your county treats GA/GR as a loan, you will have to pay it back if you have enough income to do so. Several counties require anyone who receives GA/GR, but is then later approved for Social Security Benefits, to repay GA/GR benefits. For more information on Social Security Benefits, see PG. 525. Also, many counties have rules that limit the number of months that you can get General Assistance/General Relief cash throughout the year.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125855"></a><a id="_Toc448153265"></a>How do I apply for GA/GR? </h3>
<p class="text"><a id="_Toc290728746"></a>You must apply for General Assistance/General Relief in person. If you have a disability that stops you from going into the county welfare office, you can request help. Contact your county welfare agency for details about the application process in your county. For a directory of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A, PG. 556. Note that some counties accept GA/GR applications only at specific offices, so if you are unsure about which office to go to, you should call the main county welfare office and ask. Note that you can apply for General Assistance/General Relief at the same time you apply for CalFresh (“food stamps”) and/or Medi-Cal (health insurance for low-income Californians), and it is usually a good idea to do so. Some counties may allow you to apply for General Assistance/General Relief upon release or at a community re-entry center. See PG. 495 for information on CalFresh and PG. 511 for information on Medi-Cal.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125856"></a><a id="_Toc448153266"></a>Can I apply for GA/GR while incarcerated? </h3>
<p class="text">No. You are not eligible to apply for GA/GR while in jail or prison. But remember that you may be eligible to apply once you are released.<sup><a href="#footnote-1333" id="footnote-ref-1333">[1333]</a></sup> If you are on house arrest, contact your county welfare agency to ask if you are eligible for GA/GR.<sup><a href="#footnote-1334" id="footnote-ref-1334">[1334]</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125857"></a><a id="_Toc448153267"></a>Once I’m enrolled in GA/GR, what rules must I follow to stay eligible?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on your county.<em> </em>Every county sets its own General Assistance/ General Relief rules. Here are some of the rules to know about:</p>
<ol class="text">Generally, you must fall under the income and property limits to be eligible. All counties require you to immediately report<em> any</em> changes to your address, income, or property. Failure to report such changes can result in your losing the GA/GR benefits, even if the change would not otherwise disqualify you. </ol>
<h4 class="sidebox">MORE INFORMATION ON “UNEMPLOYABLE APPLICANTS”</h4>
<p class="sidebox">You may be considered unemployable if you are: older than 70 years old; responsible for the substantial and continuous care of a family member; or you are disabled.</p>
<ul class="sidebox">Unemployable GA/GR recipients who are applying for Social Security or SSI can also receive representation or assistance in their applications.Contact your county welfare agency if you need to find out exactly what benefits and services it offers and which rules apply for General Assistance/General Relief. </ul>
<ol class="text">Some counties may limit how long you can receive GA/GR if you able to work, or require that you apply for Social Security and/ or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if you are <em>not</em> able to work. Some counties treat GA/GR as a “loan,” and will make you pay back the GA/GR money you received if you have enough income, get a job, or get approved for SSDI or SSI disability benefits.Some counties also provide you and/or require you to use employment services to help you find, get, and keep a job. But you can’t be required to join and use employment services if you are “unemployable.” You may be considered unemployable if you are: older than 70 years old; responsible for the substantial and continuous care of a family member; or you are disabled. If you have not been screened by the county welfare agency to determine if you are employable, or you believe the county has made a mistake in determining that you are “employable,” and you have been required to participate in an employment program or denied GA/GR assistance, you should consider appealing. It’s best to contact your local legal aid provider to help with filing your appeal (you can visit the website <a href="http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help">http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help</a> to browse legal aid providers, and see list of legal aid providers at the back of this guide on PG. 1180).<sup><a href="#footnote-1335" id="footnote-ref-1335">[1335]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125858"></a><a id="_Toc448153268"></a>I believe my application for General Assistance/General Relief benefits was wrongly denied or stopped. How can I appeal?</h3>
<p class="text">If you are denied or lose General Assistance/General Relief benefits, you can request a hearing at any time. The back of any county notice about General Assistance/General Relief eligibility should contain a form that explains how to request a hearing. You may also request a hearing by calling your county welfare agency. We recommend requesting a hearing in writing, so that there is a record of your compliant. </p>
<ol class="text">General Assistance/General Relief is a county program, so hearings are held by the county, and can only be requested by contacting the county social services agency. Each county has its own specific procedures regarding appeals hearings. For help filing an appeal, it’s best to find a local legal aid provider. You can search for one by visiting the website <a href="http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help">http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help</a>, and see the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180.</ol>

<h4 class="textbox"><a id="PB_CalWORKs_HHNewRulesDrugsConvictions"></a>Important Update!New CalWORKs Rules for People with Prior Drug Felony Convictions</h4>
<p class="textbox">GREAT NEWS! California eliminated the ban on aid for people with past drug-related felony convictions. Starting on April 1, 2015, you won’t be disqualified from CalWORKs or CalFresh because of a prior drug-related felony conviction and you will no longer be required to report a prior drug-felony conviction on any application or report (see more on CalFresh “food stamps” beginning on PG. 495). If you applied for CalWORKs or CalFresh before April 1, 2015, and were denied due to a past drug-related felony conviction, it’s recommended that you REAPPLY NOW under the newer rules.<em> </em>To remain eligible, it’s important to follow the conditions of your parole, probation, or other form of community supervision, or be off supervision. If you violate the terms of your parole, probation, or other form of community supervision, you will lose your CalFresh and CalWORKs. (See Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code §§ 11251.3, 17012.50.) <em>If anyone in your family was already receiving CalWORKs aid,</em> your benefits should have been automatically added to your family’s April 2015 Grant. Once you are added to CalWORKs, you are also required to participate in the Welfare-to-Work program requirement (see PG. 523). If you were already meeting Welfare-to-Work requirements, you became newly eligible for transportation costs, subsidized child care, and other work supports. Contact your family’s CalWORKs caseworker if you do not receive a letter from the county about these new benefits and rules by March 1, 2015. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125862"></a><a id="_Toc448153272"></a>What benefits and services can I get through CalWORKs?</h3>
<p class="text">You can get cash assistance, employment services, and other benefits.</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">ABOUT THE 48-MONTH LIMIT</h4>
<p class="sidebox">This 48-month limit is a lifetime limit. In special situations, you can keep getting cash aid for longer. Contact your county CalWORKs office for details.</p>
<p class="text"><em>Cash assistance: </em>CalWORKs provides monthly cash aid to help pay for basic needs such as housing, food, utilities, clothing, and medical care. Your monthly aid (“grant level”) is based on two factors:<em>Your family size:</em> Generally, if you have a larger family, you’ll qualify for more cash aid; and if you have a smaller family, you’ll qualify for less.<em>Where you live:</em> Generally, if you live in an urban county (“Region I”) where living costs are higher, you’ll qualify for more cash aid; and if you live in a rural county (“Region II”), you’ll qualify for less.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1353" id="footnote-ref-1353">[1353]</a></sup></sup>Generally, parents or caretakers can get CalWORKs cash aid for up to 48 months. But in many cases, a child in the family can keep getting cash aid after the 48 months are up.<sup><a href="#footnote-1354" id="footnote-ref-1354">[1354]</a></sup><em>Employment services:</em> CalWORKs provides job training and job counseling services through a program called Welfare-to-Work (WTW).<sup><a href="#footnote-1355" id="footnote-ref-1355">[1355]</a></sup> For more information about Welfare-to-Work, see PG. 523.<em>Other benefits: </em>Depending on your situation and what your county provides, you may qualify for other benefits through CalWORKs, such as: </p>

<h3>Once I’m enrolled in CalWORKs, what rules must I follow to stay eligible? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">TYPES OF CHANGES TO REPORt within 10 days</h4>
<p class="sidebox">These kinds of changes include: moving to a new address; having someone join or leave your household; adding to your household a new member who has a drug-related felony, is in violation of a probation or parole condition, or is running from the law. </p>
<p class="text">To keep getting CalWORKs benefits, you and your family must stay within income and resource limits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1359" id="footnote-ref-1359">[1359]</a></sup> In addition, you and all of the adults in your family must follow requirements related to Welfare-to-Work activities, reporting changes, and maintaining children’s access to health care and school.</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Welfare-to-Work:</em> Generally, you and any other adults in your family must participate in welfare-to-work activities for a certain number of hours per week. The hours and activities required of you will depend partly on your family situation, and partly on what county you live in (see PG. 523). In special cases, adults may be “exempt” (excused) from welfare-to-work requirements. You may be exempt if you are: disabled for 30+ days; under age 19 and attending school full-time; over age 60; caring for a relative’s child who is at risk of being put in foster care; OR caring for a sick or disabled person.<sup><a href="#footnote-1360" id="footnote-ref-1360">[1360]</a></sup> <em>Reporting:</em> You must regularly report changes to your income and living situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1361" id="footnote-ref-1361">[1361]</a></sup> If both you and your child are on CalWORKs, you must report once every 6 months via a Semi-Annual Income Eligibility Report known as “SAR 7.” If only your child gets CalWORKs, you must report once a year. In addition, you must immediately report certain changes within 10 days. <em>Children: </em>If your child is under age 6, he or she must have all standard immunizations. If your child is of school age and under age 16, he or she must be attending school regularly.<sup><a href="#footnote-1362" id="footnote-ref-1362">[1362]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125867"></a><a id="_Toc448153277"></a>I believe my CalWORKs was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? </h3>
<p class="text">If the county decides to deny your application, it must mail you a “Notice of Action” explaining why you were denied. It must do so within 30 days of receiving your application. If you disagree, you have the right to ask for a State Hearing to appeal (challenge) the denial. You must request a hearing within 90 days of the county’s decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1363" id="footnote-ref-1363">[1363]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4>Ways you can request a State hearing:</h4>

<h4 class="sidebox">CalFresh Signing!</h4>
<p class="sidebox">One adult household member (or authorized representative) must sign your CalFresh application under penalty of perjury. This means that if you knowingly told a lie (for example, lying about how many people live in your household), a criminal charge can be brought against you.</p>
<p class="text">CalFresh is California’s “food stamps” program, providing money for low-income adults and their families to buy food. This program is part of the federal program called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).<sup><a href="#footnote-1367" id="footnote-ref-1367">[1367]</a></sup> Each county runs its own CalFresh program and issues food benefits (food stamps) in the form of a plastic Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, which looks and feels like a credit card. CalFresh includes the California Food Assistance Program (CFAP), which provides the same benefits as CalFresh but to <em>noncitizen legal permanent residents</em> (see PG. 495 for CFAP’s requirements).</p>
<a id="_Toc290125870"></a>
<a id="_Toc448153280"></a>
<h3>Am I eligible for CalFresh?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (CFAP)</h4>
<p class="sidebox">LPRs (Green Card holders) who have not lived in the U.S. for 5 years technically receive CalFresh benefits through CFAP, which is a program within CalFresh. Counties treat and administer CFAP benefits the same as CalFresh benefits. CFAP beneficiaries are treated the same and use their benefits the exact same way that CalFresh beneficiaries do. When you apply for CalFresh, the county automatically determines your CFAP eligibility too. For more information, please visit the CalFresh handbook at <a href="http://www.sccgov.org/ssa/foods/fschap31.pdf">http://www.sccgov.org/ssa/foods/fschap31.pdf</a>. </p>
<p class="text">There are many factors that are considered to determine whether you are eligible for CalFresh. Most are related to residency, citizenship/immigration status, and income. In some cases, certain people in a household may qualify for CalFresh while others do not, even though they live in the same house (see PG. 495 for the definition of a “household”).</p>
<h4 class="textbox"><a id="PublicBenefits_CalFresh_Eligibility"></a>Helpful HintCalFresh “Households”</h4>
<div class="textbox9">For CalFresh, a “household” can be one person, or it can be any group of people who live together, buy food, and make meals together. This means if you live with other people, but you buy and prepare food separately from them, you can apply for food benefits as part of a separate household.<sup><a href="#footnote-1368" id="footnote-ref-1368">[1368]</a></sup> Spouses and parents and their children under age 22 who live together must apply as a single “household.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1369" id="footnote-ref-1369">[1369]</a></sup></div>
<ol class="text">To be eligible for CalFresh (food stamps), you must:Be a resident of the county where you are applying.<sup><a href="#footnote-1370" id="footnote-ref-1370">[1370]</a></sup> Be a U.S. citizen or a “qualifying noncitizen.” You’re a “qualifying noncitizen” if you: (1) Are a lawful permanent resident (“LPR” or “Green Card Holder”) and (2) you meet all other CalFresh eligibility requirements<sup><a href="#footnote-1371" id="footnote-ref-1371">[1371]</a></sup> Have a monthly total income that is no greater than the CalFresh income limit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1372" id="footnote-ref-1372">[1372]</a></sup> The maximum total income you can have will depend on your household size, and the maximum limits change every year. Contact your local CalFresh office or call the toll free number below to learn what the limit is for your household when you’re ready to apply. You can also use this online tool to calculate how much CalFresh money you can get per month: <a href="http://lsnc.net/calculator/FFY2014_Food_Stamp_Calculator_Final_PlusNovemberCut.xls">http://lsnc.net/calculator/FFY2014_Food_Stamp_Calculator_Final_<br/>PlusNovemberCut.xls</a>.Call toll-free English: 1-877-847-3663 Spanish: 1-888-926-6432You can also look online at <a href="http://www.cdss.ca.gov/foodstamps/PG3628.htm">http://www.cdss.ca.gov/foodstamps/PG3628.htm</a>Keep in mind that the maximum gross income limits do not always apply to households with mixed immigration status and/or people who are seniors or disabled.If you have less than $200 in liquid resources, you may be entitled to expedited benefits, and receive your benefits within three working days. For CalFresh purposes, “liquid resources” include all funds readily available to your household, such as; cash on hand, money in bank accounts, trust deeds, stocks, bonds, or individual retirement account (IRA) funds.You can still qualify for CalFresh if you own the home you live in, own a car, have a job, and/or do not have children. </ol>
<h4 class="textbox">How Other Public Benefits Programs Combine With CalFresh </h4>
<ol class="text">Individuals who receive SSI/SSP benefits are currently not eligible for CalFresh, but other people in the household may still qualify. SSI benefits, for example, already include the value of CalFresh benefits, through a process known as “cash out.” For more information, please visit <a href="http://cfpa.net/CalFresh/CFPAPublications/CalFresh-Cashout101-2013.pdf">http://cfpa.net/CalFresh/CFPAPublications/CalFresh-Cashout101-2013.pdf</a>. If you or your household is receiving cash aid—such as CalWORKs or GA/GR, you are “categorically eligible” for CalFresh (food stamps). However, you can still qualify CalFresh without receiving cash aid like CalWORKs or GA/GR, and in fact, most CalFresh recipients do not receive cash assistance.<sup><a href="#footnote-1373" id="footnote-ref-1373">[1373]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153281"></a><a id="_Toc290125871"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get CalFresh? </h3>
<p class="text">Maybe. But remember, even if you are not eligible, others in your household may be. You might be disqualified if: </p>
<ol class="text">You are a “fleeing felon”—meaning you are hiding or running away to avoid felony charges or to avoid being incarcerated for a felony conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1374" id="footnote-ref-1374">[1374]</a></sup></sup>You are in violation of a condition of your probation or parole, as found by a court or administrative judge.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1375" id="footnote-ref-1375">[1375]</a></sup></sup> You have been found guilty of an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) involving fraud or misuse of public benefits.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1376" id="footnote-ref-1376">[1376]</a></sup></sup> Depending on how many IPVs you have, and what they were for, you may be disqualified from CalFresh and CalWORKs for varying periods of time—anywhere between 12 months to life.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1377" id="footnote-ref-1377">[1377]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<h5 class="question"><a id="PB_CalFresh_IPVexplanation"></a>What does it mean to be “found guilty of an IPV”?</h5>
<p class="text">If a county welfare agency thinks you violated its rules when applying for or getting benefits, it may investigate and hold an administrative hearing to determine if you are guilty. It may also ask you to admit guilt by signing a Disqualification Consent Agreement (DCA). When you apply for CalWORKs, any prior IPV counts against you if you were found guilty at a hearing, or you admitted guilt by signing a DCA (even if you did not have a hearing). </p>

If you applied for CalFresh (or CalWORKs) before April 1, 2015, and were denied due to a past drug-related felony conviction, you should REAPPLY NOW under the newer, more favorable rules.To remain eligible, you must follow the conditions of your parole, probation, or other form of community supervision, or be off supervision. If you violate the terms of your parole, probation, or other form of community supervision, you will lose your CalFresh and CalWORKs (<em>See</em> CalFresh Regulation 63-163.1). </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125872"></a><a id="_Toc448153282"></a>How do I apply for CalFresh?</h3>
<a id="_Toc290728748"></a>
<p class="text">The process may vary by county. Generally, it involves filling out a form, providing documents, and having an interview. For details about how to apply in your county, contact the CalFresh office in your area. For a directory of county CalFresh offices, see Appendix A, on PG. 556.<sup><a href="#footnote-1378" id="footnote-ref-1378">[1378]</a></sup> For information on how to apply for CalFresh benefits in your county, please call 1-877-847-3663. You can also apply online at <a href="http://benefitscal.org">http://benefitscal.org</a>.</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">Helpful Hint:What is an “Authorized Representative (AR)”?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">You can select and authorize any adult person as an Authorized Representative (AR) to apply and have the interview on your behalf. To find out how, contact the CalFresh office or Social Services Agency in the county where you’ll be living.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125873"></a><a id="_Toc448153283"></a>Can I apply for CalFresh while incarcerated? </h3>
<p class="text">Yes! You can’t receive CalFresh benefits until you’re out, but, under some circumstances, you can apply while in prison or jail.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1379" id="footnote-ref-1379">[1379]</a></sup></sup> Although you may apply for CalFresh while incarcerated, you should not do so unless you are less than 30 days from your release date. (If you apply for CalFresh more than 30 days before your release date, the county social services agency will probably deny your application because they will find that you are not eligible for the program yet – but you can re-apply again once you’re within 30 days of release or after you get out.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1380" id="footnote-ref-1380">[1380]</a></sup></sup>) If you apply for CalFresh benefits while incarcerated, you will generally need to provide proof of your release date and a local address within the county.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1381" id="footnote-ref-1381">[1381]</a></sup></sup> You must also complete and sign the application and designate an <em>Authorized Representative</em> (see Helpful Hint Box for more information.)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1382" id="footnote-ref-1382">[1382]</a></sup></sup> If you are approved for CalFresh benefits, you will not begin receiving these benefits until after you get out.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1383" id="footnote-ref-1383">[1383]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125874"></a><a id="_Toc448153284"></a>How do I receive my CalFresh benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">If you are approved for CalFresh benefits, they will be issued on an Electronic Benefits Transfer Card (EBT). You will need to set up a PIN number for the card to use it, and can then use the card at most grocery stores. In some counties, people who are homeless, elderly or disabled can also use their benefits at certain restaurants through the CalFresh Restaurant Meal Program. Visit <a href="http://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/clientinformation/calfreshrmp.shtml">http://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/clientinformation/calfreshrmp.shtml</a> to see which counties participate in the CalFresh Restaurant Meal Program and to locate participating restaurants. </p>
<h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintCalFresh for People Living in Drug/Alcohol Treatment Centers and Other Licensed Residential Facilities:</h4>
<p class="textbox">If you are required to live in a residential facility (for example, a drug/alcohol treatment center) after getting out of prison or jail, then special CalFresh rules apply to you: </p>
<ul class="textbox">If you live in a treatment/residential facility that does NOT provide a majority of your meals, then you may apply as a one-person CalFresh “household.”However, if you live in a treatment/residential facility that provides the majority of your meals, then you are only eligible for benefits that the facility applies for, and you MUST be certified for CalFresh through an Authorized Representative (AR). Either you or your AR may sign the application forms. The AR is designated in writing by the head of the household. The AR must sign the form “Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Request for Designated Alternate Cardholder/Authorized Representative” (CSF 64 form) and the benefits will be assigned to the facility, not to the resident (see sample CSF 64 form in Appendix B, PG. 558).<sup><a href="#footnote-1384" id="footnote-ref-1384">[1384]</a></sup> </ul>

<h3>Once I’m enrolled in CalFresh, what rules must I follow to stay eligible? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">EXCEPTIONS TO WORK REQUIREMENT</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Certain people are exempt (excused) from these work requirements. You may be exempt if you are:</p>
<ul class="sidebox">physically or mentally unfit to be workingalready engaged in the CalWORKs work programreceiving unemployment insurance benefitsparticipating in a drug or alcohol addiction treatment programenrolled in school on at least a half-time basisan honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. military.</ul>
<p class="sidebox">Contact your county CalFresh office for details. </p>
<p class="text"><em>Purchase requirements:</em> You can only use CalFresh benefits to buy food. You can’t use CalFresh benefits to buy any non-food items such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, household cleaning supplies, toiletries, or cosmetics, and you can’t exchange CalFresh benefits for money. If you sell your CalFresh benefits or use them for non-food items, you can be charged with fraud and you could be banned from receiving CalFresh and other food benefits for life. <em>Time Limits: </em>Typically, every able-bodied adult (ages 18-49) without dependents in your household is limited to 3 months of aid in a 36-month period unless you are working at least 20 hours per week; participating in an approved work activity; OR doing workfare.<sup><a href="#footnote-1385" id="footnote-ref-1385">[1385]</a></sup> But California HAS WAIVED this requirement through September 30, 2015, due to California’s high unemployment rate.<sup><a href="#footnote-1386" id="footnote-ref-1386">[1386]</a></sup> <em>Work Requirements:</em> As a CalFresh recipient, your county may require you to participate in an Employment and Training program, unless your county is listed as a “Labor Surplus Area” (LSA). An LSA is a county that, during the last two years, has had an unemployment rate of 20% or more above the national average. Right now, all counties are expected to be listed as LSAs until December 2016. Additionally, if you are employed, but choose to leave your job, and apply for or receive CalFresh benefits, you can’t get CalFresh for 3 months.<em>Report Requirements:</em> Most CalFresh households must submit a report, called a Semi-Annual Income Eligibility Report (SAR 7) every six months.<sup><a href="#footnote-1387" id="footnote-ref-1387">[1387]</a></sup> Additionally, they must immediately report a change in address, any changes in employment, changes in people who live with the family, and anytime their income goes over the Interim Report Threshold. Failure to report within the time limits could result in an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) (IPVs explained on PG. 497).<em>Recertification requirements:</em> When you first enroll in CalFresh, your enrollment will only last for a limited time called a “certification period.” This is usually one year, but in some cases it’s only a few months. If you want to get CalFresh for longer than that, then before this period ends, you must apply for recertification—that is, prove that you’re still eligible for CalFresh. Before the first day of the last month of your certification period, the county should send you a “Notice of Expiration” (NOE) that says when, where, and how to apply for recertification. If your certification period is 1-2 months, the county must give you a NOE at the start of your certification period.<sup><a href="#footnote-1388" id="footnote-ref-1388">[1388]</a></sup></p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: To keep getting CalFresh without interruption, apply for recertification on or before the 15th day of the last month of your certification period; For example, if your 1-year certification period runs April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, you must recertify BEFORE March 15, 2015. Please note: If your certification period has expired and your recertification application has been delayed, and your household has very little income, check to see if you qualify for “expedited services” (ES) CalFresh (read more on PG. 495). If so, you may be able to get recertified for CalFresh benefits in just 3 days.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125876"></a><a id="_Toc448153286"></a>I believe my CalFresh was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? </h3>
<p class="text">If the county denies your CalFresh application, it must mail you a Notice of Action explaining why. It must do so within 30 days of getting your application. If you disagree, you have a right to ask for a State hearing to appeal (challenge) the denial. You must request a hearing within 90 days of the county’s decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1389" id="footnote-ref-1389">[1389]</a></sup></sup> In order to continue receiving benefits during your appeal, with assistance being paid while your appeal is pending, you must request a hearing within 10 days.</p>
<h4>Ways you can request a State hearing:</h4>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153288"></a>What is a food bank?</h3>
<p class="text">A food bank is a nonprofit organization that asks for, stores, and gives out food. They sometimes give the food to a variety of smaller organizations (churches, non-profits, community centers, libraries) that also serve people in need.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125879"></a><a id="_Toc448153289"></a>Where can I find food?</h3>

<h3><a id="_Toc290125880"></a><a id="_Toc448153290"></a><a id="PB_Food_EFAP"></a>What is the Emergency Food Assistance Program (EFAP)?</h3>
<p class="text">The Emergency Food Assistance Program (EFAP) is a federal government program that sends food to county food banks. The food banks then distribute this free food to eligible individuals and households.<sup><a href="#footnote-1394" id="footnote-ref-1394">[1394]</a></sup> See the next question to learn how to find an EFAP-supported food bank. To be eligible for EFAP benefits at a county food bank, your household must (1) live within the region that the food bank serves, and (2) self-certify that they meet the income requirements.<span class="space"> </span>To see if your household meets income requirements, call the California Department of Social Services’ Emergency Food Assistance Program office at 916-229-3344.<sup><a href="#footnote-1395" id="footnote-ref-1395">[1395]</a></sup>If you do not have a place to prepare food, you should ask the food bank to give you a list of soup kitchens, which also receive food through the state’s Emergency Food Assistance Program.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125881"></a><a id="_Toc448153291"></a>Where can I find a food bank to get EFAP benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">Steps to finding food banks/partner agencies:</p>
<ol class="text">You should try to go to an Emergency Food Assistance Program food bank near your house. Try looking online at <a href="http://www.cafoodbanks.org/Hunger-in-CA">http://www.cafoodbanks.org/Hunger-in-CA</a> or call the Association of California Food Banks at 1-866-321-4435.If there are no Emergency Food Assistance Program food banks near your house, then you should try to go to an Emergency Food Assistance Program food bank nearby. You might still be able to get food there if you show that you live in an area that’s within the same county. But be aware that—you might be turned away and told to try and find a food bank that serves the area you live in.If you are turned away, remember you can always try and find a non- Emergency Food Assistance Program food bank or partner agency that does not use Emergency Food Assistance Program restrictions. </ol>

<h3><a id="_Toc290125882"></a><a id="_Toc448153292"></a>What documents might I need to get EFAP benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">When you go to a county food bank seeking Emergency Food Assistance Program benefits, you may be asked to show <em>proof that you live in the service area</em>, such as a government-issued I.D. card with your address (for example, a Driver License, library card, or voter registration card). But even if you don’t have proof of residency, you should not be denied food as long as you agree to sign an “Emergency Food Assistance Program Certification of Eligibility Form” (Form EFA-7) (see example form in Appendix C, PG. 560).</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125883"></a><a id="_Toc448153293"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get EFAP?</h3>
<p class="text">No. You will be able to get EFAP food benefits no matter your criminal history. Only two factors matter—where you live and how much income you have. Even if your address falls outside of an EFAP food bank’s service area, you might still be able to get food there, if you can prove that you live in the same county. But there is also the possibility that the food bank turns you away and asks that you go to the food bank that serves the area where you live.</p>

<p class="text">Covered California is an online health care marketplace where you can sign up for health care coverage online, by phone, by mail, or in person. This online marketplace is a website where you can “shop” by choosing a health care plan and compare various plans’ prices and benefits. Each health care plan must cover essential health benefits, such as doctor visits, hospitalization, emergency care, maternity leave, pediatric care for children, and prescriptions. Through the Covered California application process, you can find out if you’re eligible to get federal tax credits to reduce your health care costs, or if you’re eligible for free or low-cost health care coverage through Medi-Cal (see PG. 511 for more information on Medi-Cal).<sup><a href="#footnote-1401" id="footnote-ref-1401">[1401]</a></sup></p>

<ul class="textbox">Birthdates and Social Security Numbers (SSNs) of all household members. For Covered California, a “family” is defined as the person who files taxes as head of household, plus all dependents claimed on those taxes.If you are NOT a citizen, you must have your immigrant status information. Proof of citizenship or immigration status is required only for individuals in your family who are applying for health care coverage. You are allowed to apply for your child even if you aren’t eligible for coverage because of your immigration status. Applying for your eligible child won’t affect your immigration status, or your chances of getting immigrant or citizenship status.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1429" id="footnote-ref-1429">[1429]</a></sup></sup> Also, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has stated that they will not use information obtained through health care applications for immigration enforcement purposes.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1430" id="footnote-ref-1430">[1430]</a></sup></sup>Current income and latest tax return information for your household.

<p class="textbox">When applying for Medi-Cal benefits, you may request retroactive Medi-Cal coverage for medical services you received during any of the three calendar months immediately before the month that you applied to Medi-Cal, so long as the services would have qualified for coverage had you been enrolled in Medi-Cal at the time.

<p class="text">It depends on how long your incarceration lasts. In California, as soon as you go to prison or jail, your Medi-Cal gets suspended, meaning paused. </p>
<ol class="text">If you’re incarcerated for less than 1 year: you can reactivate your enrollment by working with staff at your correctional facility before you get out, or by notifying the Medi-Cal office as soon as you’re out.

<h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintThe Medi-Cal Inmate Eligibility Program (MCIEP)</h4>
<p class="textbox">If you are pregnant, disabled, blind, or aged, MCIEP allows Medi-Cal to cover expenses for inpatient (over 24 hours) medical care in non-correctional healthcare facilities (such as hospitals) to individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medi-Cal.

California law on this has recently changed, and different rules started to apply on January 1, 2014.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1461" id="footnote-ref-1461">[1461]</a></sup></sup> The old rule. If you were incarcerated before January 1, 2014:<em> </em>If you were on Medi-Cal prior to your incarceration, then your Medi-Cal was ended on the day that you entered jail or prison.

If you were incarcerated anytime after January 1, 2014: If you were on Medi-Cal prior to your incarceration, then your Medi-Cal got automatically suspended (paused) on the day that you entered jail or prison. The suspension period is set to last 1 year. This means that:</p>

<p class="textbox">Medicare is a federal health care program for people who are elderly and people who have disabilities. Medicare benefits are grouped into four parts: Part A covers hospital care; Part B covers outpatient services; Part C covers services offered by private insurance plans; and Part D covers prescription drugs. There are two main ways to get your Medicare coverage: (1) Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) OR (2) a Part C Medicare Advantage Plan. Some people get additional coverage, such as optional prescription drug coverage through Part D. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125907"></a><a id="_Toc448153321"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get Medicare? </h3>

<h3><a id="_Toc290125908"></a><a id="_Toc448153322"></a>Am I eligible for Medicare? </h3>
<p class="text">When you apply for Medicare, you have to consider whether you will eligible to enroll in each part Parts A and B (and possibly D) or Part C (and possibly D). This is because each Part has difference requirements and rules, and your incarceration affects each Part differently.<sup><a href="#footnote-1466" id="footnote-ref-1466">[1466]</a></sup> </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">APPLY TO MEDICARE BEFORE YOU TURN 65! </h4>

<p class="text">If you’re a citizen of the U.S., or you’ve been a legal resident for 5+ years, you may qualify for Medicare if:</p>

<h3><a id="_Toc290125911"></a><a id="_Toc448153325"></a><a id="PublicBenefits_Medicare_Incarcerated"></a>Can I apply for Medicare while incarcerated? </h3>
<p class="text">Yes! If you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare while incarcerated, you should contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) to enroll in Parts A and B. Unlike people who are not in custody, you will NOT be automatically enrolled—so you need to take action. Although Medicare won’t start paying for your health care until you’re released, it’s important to get enrolled as soon as you can. This way, you avoid getting charged penalties for late enrollment, and you also ensure that your Medicare is ready as soon as you’re out.</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">When:</span> Contact the SSA to get enrolled during the 7-month period surrounding your 65<sup>th</sup> birthday—the month of your birthday, plus 3 months before, and 3 months following. This is called your Initial Enrollment Period (“IEP”). Supposing that you turn 65 on April 10, 2015, your Initial Enrollment Period would run from January 1, 2015 through July 31, 2015. If you don’t enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period, you may not have access to health care for months after you’re released; and you may get charged penalties if you try to enroll in Medicare later.<span class="emphasisitalic">How:</span> Send a signed and dated letter to the Social Security Administration. The letter should include your full name, Social Security Number, a clear statement that you want to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, and the date that your coverage should be effective. Make sure you sign the letter. Keep a copy of your letter and a copy of the envelope—and, if possible, send the letter by certified mail with return receipt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1482" id="footnote-ref-1482">[1482]</a></sup> </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc290125912"></a><a id="_Toc448153326"></a>I had Medicare when I entered prison or jail. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated? </h3>
<p class="text">All your Medicare benefits get suspended (paused) while you’re incarcerated.

When you’re released, your access to Part A benefits should be automatically restored.<sup><a href="#footnote-1484" id="footnote-ref-1484">[1484]</a></sup> <em>&gt; Your Part B (medical insurance) is more complicated, since you can only stay enrolled by paying premiums.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1485" id="footnote-ref-1485">[1485]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="sidebox">MUST ENROLL FOR PART B PREMIMUMS AFTER INCARCERATION!</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you’ve been getting Social Security or SSDI, these benefits have been paying for your Part B premiums. Once you’ve been incarcerated for 30 days, these benefits get suspended; so you must call 1-800-MEDICARE within that 30-day window and set up direct payment if you want to keep Part B. </p>
<ol class="text">If you keep paying premiums, you’ll stay enrolled, although you won’t get Medicare benefits while incarcerated.If you stop paying premiums, your coverage will be ended; and for every 12 months that pass before you re-enroll, your premium amount will be higher by 10%.<sup><a href="#footnote-1486" id="footnote-ref-1486">[1486]</a></sup> Also, you can re-enroll in Part B only during the General Enrollment Period (“GEP”), which runs January through March, and coverage starts July 1 of the year that you enroll. Depending on your release date, this may cause a gap in your medical coverage.<sup><a href="#footnote-1487" id="footnote-ref-1487">[1487]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">These rules create a dilemma if you’re someone who can’t afford to keep paying Part B premiums while incarcerated, and won’t be able to afford higher premiums upon release. If you were on Medicare and SSDI before incarceration, you may be able to address this dilemma by applying for SSDI while incarcerated (see PG. 540).<em>&gt; Your Part C (Medicare Advantage plan) and Part D (prescription drug plan) will end when you’re incarcerated. </em>You’re no longer eligible to be enrolled in these plans while the prison or jail is providing your health care. If you want Part C and/or Part D after release, you’ll have to re-enroll (for details, see PG. 519).<sup><a href="#footnote-1488" id="footnote-ref-1488">[1488]</a></sup></p>

<p class="text">If you had Part A (hospital insurance) before you were incarcerated, you don’t have to do anything to restart it.

<ol class="text">If you kept paying premiums and stayed enrolled in Part B while incarcerated: you don’t have to do anything to restart it. Your enrollment is in place, and you should have access to Part B coverage once you’re released.<sup><a href="#footnote-1490" id="footnote-ref-1490">[1490]</a></sup>If you stopped paying premiums and your Medicare enrollment was ended while incarcerated: you can re-enroll during General Enrollment Period (“GEP”), which runs January to March.Your Part B coverage will start on July 1 of that year. You’ll have a higher premium based on how many months passed since your Medicare enrollment ended.If you’re under 65 and previously qualified for Medicare due to a disability, you must restart your SSDI before you can get Part B again. Once you know your release date, contact Social Security to do this (see PG. 527).<sup><a href="#footnote-1491" id="footnote-ref-1491">[1491]</a></sup>If you had Part C (Medicare Advantage) and Part D (prescription drug plan) before you were incarcerated, these forms of coverage ended during your incarceration. If you want Part C and/or D after release, you must enroll again during your Special Enrollment Period (“SEP”). Your SEP starts the month before your release date and ends two months after that date. If you miss your SEP, you’ll be charged a penalty when you try to enroll later.<sup><a href="#footnote-1492" id="footnote-ref-1492">[1492]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you qualified for Medicare through SSDI, you need to restart your SSDI benefits before you can get Medicare coverage back. Even if you contact Social Security before your release, you won’t start getting SSDI again until a month after release. One possible way to avoid a gap in health care coverage is to apply for SSI before your release, if you qualify. If your SSI application is approved, you’ll be automatically enrolled in both SSI and Medi-Cal as soon as you’re released. You’ll only be on SSI for 1 month until your SSDI kicks in, and then your Medi-Cal will be linked to your SSDI again.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1493" id="footnote-ref-1493">[1493]</a></sup></strong> </p>

<p class="text">Social Security is a federal benefits program that provides cash benefits to retired people, disabled people, and their dependents. Social security is a “pay-as-you-go” program, meaning that workers pay Social Security taxes, and these taxes are used to provide benefits to Social Security beneficiaries (retired people, disabled people, and their dependents). For starters, there are four ways to qualify for federal Social Security benefits: </p>
<ol class="text">As a retired individual;As a disabled individual;As the spouse or dependent of an eligible individual; or As the survivor of an eligible individual.</ol>

<h4 class="sidebox">HOW TO CHECK FOR SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS </h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you’re not sure how many Social Security credits you have, you can call the SSA (1-800-772-1213), have a Form SSA-7004, “Request for Social Security Statement” sent to you, and submit the form. If you have Internet access, you can also use the Online Retirement Estimator on the SSA’s website by visiting <a href="http://www.ssa.gov">www.ssa.gov</a>.</p>
<p class="text">Social Security retirement benefits are paid out of money collected from Social Security taxes on individual paychecks to working taxpayers.<sup><a href="#footnote-1518" id="footnote-ref-1518">[1518]</a></sup> For each year you work and pay Social Security taxes to the government, you earn “credits”—up to 4 per year. Generally, you need 40 credits (10 years of working and paying Social Security taxes) to qualify for retirement benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1519" id="footnote-ref-1519">[1519]</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153341"></a><a id="PublicBenefits_SocialSec_Eligib"></a>Am I eligible for Social Security retirement benefits?</h3>

<p class="text">You can start getting retirement benefits as early as age 62. But depending on your situation, you may want to wait so you can get a higher monthly benefit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1520" id="footnote-ref-1520">[1520]</a></sup> This age may be 65, 66, or 67, depending on what year you were born.<sup><a href="#footnote-1521" id="footnote-ref-1521">[1521]</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153342"></a><a id="PublicBenefits_SocialSec_CrimHistory"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get retirement benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">Possibly—but it might be just temporary. You can’t receive Social Security benefits for any month that you:</p>
<ol class="text">Are confined in a correctional facility for a period of 30+ days in a row due to a conviction;<sup><a href="#footnote-1522" id="footnote-ref-1522">[1522]</a></sup> Are confined to an institution by court order because you’ve been found “guilty” but insane, “not guilty” due to insanity or mental illness, or “incompetent to stand trial”;<sup><a href="#footnote-1523" id="footnote-ref-1523">[1523]</a></sup> Have an outstanding arrest warrant because you’re avoiding prosecution or confinement for a felony; or<sup><a href="#footnote-1524" id="footnote-ref-1524">[1524]</a></sup> Have been determined by a judge to be violating a condition of probation or parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-1525" id="footnote-ref-1525">[1525]</a></sup> <em>Here is an example of how this works:</em> If you were convicted and confined on March 29, 2014 and you stayed in jail until May 2, 2014, you weren’t entitled to any benefits for the months of March, April, or May since you were being confined for 35 days in a row.<sup><a href="#footnote-1526" id="footnote-ref-1526">[1526]</a></sup> This means you cannot collect back payments for any benefits you otherwise would have received if you never had a conviction, warrant, or violation as described in the four situations above.<sup><a href="#footnote-1527" id="footnote-ref-1527">[1527]</a></sup> Additionally, if you were in prison or jail over 30 days, you may have accrued an overpayment, which may be withheld from future Social Security benefits once you are released and your benefits are reinstated.<sup><a href="#footnote-1528" id="footnote-ref-1528">[1528]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">Once you qualify for Social Security retirement benefits, you stay enrolled in the program as long as you’re eligible. Although your benefits get suspended (paused) during incarceration, they don’t get terminated (permanently ended) due to your incarceration, no matter how long your incarceration lasts.<sup><a href="#footnote-1529" id="footnote-ref-1529">[1529]</a></sup> If you’re currently being incarcerated for 30 or more days, and you were already getting retirement benefits when you were arrested, those benefits were paused on your 31<sup>st</sup> day of incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-1530" id="footnote-ref-1530">[1530]</a></sup> But you can apply to restart them once you have documents showing your release date (see PG. 529).

<p class="text">TIPS:</p>
<ol class="text">Before you start, you may want to look over the Social Security’s application checklist (see Appendix G, on PG. 570).<sup><a href="#footnote-1535" id="footnote-ref-1535">[1535]</a></sup> to gather the information you need.If you need help with the application, call the Social Security Administration or visit a local Social Security office. You have a right to assistance from Social Security representatives if you need help due to a disability.<sup><a href="#footnote-1536" id="footnote-ref-1536">[1536]</a></sup> You have a right to appoint any individual—such as a friend, family member, attorney, social worker, or other trusted advocate—to act as your representative in the application process. To do so, use the form in Appendix F, PG. 570.<sup><a href="#footnote-1537" id="footnote-ref-1537">[1537]</a></sup> If you need benefits right away due to a financial emergency, ask if you can get “expedited” benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1538" id="footnote-ref-1538">[1538]</a></sup> </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153344"></a>Can I apply for retirement benefits while incarcerated?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes! You can’t receive Social Security benefits while incarcerated<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1539" id="footnote-ref-1539">[1539]</a></sup></sup>—but if you haven’t applied before, and you think you may qualify, you can start the application process as early as several months before your release date. Some prisons and jails have a prerelease agreement with local Social Security offices. Ask the pre-release staff if your facility has a pre-lease agreement with a local Social Security Office. </p>
<ol class="text">If your facility has a pre-release agreement:Speak to the pre-release staff. They should be available to help you complete and submit your application before your release. Pre-release staff should also notify the Social Security office about your release date. Ideally, if a prerelease agreement is in place, staff should start working with you several months before your release, and Social Security should then process your application promptly so that your benefits will start shortly after you get out.<sup><a href="#footnote-1540" id="footnote-ref-1540">[1540]</a></sup>If your facility doesn’t offer prerelease assistance—and/or you have trouble working with correctional staff:Call Social Security to have application materials mailed to you and get help with them. Be prepared to give your Social Security number and release date. If Social Security’s automated phone system doesn’t accept your call, you should ask a non-incarcerated family member to call as an Authorized Representative (“AR”) on your behalf (use the form in Appendix F, PG. 570to appoint a family member as an AR).</ol>
<h4 class="sidebox">What to do if you know you will be incarcerated 30 days or more:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">As soon as you know that you will be incarcerated for 30 or more days, you should report this fact to Social Security so that your benefits get suspended in a timely way. If you get any Social Security checks for any months during which you’re incarcerated, these will be treated as overpayments and you’ll have to repay them later. The amounts might get deducted from your future Social Security benefits, when you’re later released from incarceration.</p>
<ol class="text">An SSA representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.<sup><a href="#footnote-1541" id="footnote-ref-1541">[1541]</a></sup> </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153345"></a>I was receiving retirement benefits when I entered prison or jail. What happens to them while I’m incarcerated?</h3>
<p class="text">If you were convicted and incarcerated for 30 or more days in a row, your Social Security benefits got suspended on the 31st day.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1542" id="footnote-ref-1542">[1542]</a></sup></sup> You can’t get these benefits while incarcerated, but you’ll stay enrolled in the program. This means if your spouse or children have been getting benefits based on your Social Security eligibility, they’ll keep getting them while you’re incarcerated (even if your benefits were suspended), so long as they’re eligible.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1543" id="footnote-ref-1543">[1543]</a></sup></sup> This also means that once you have official documents proving your release date, you can apply to restart your retirement benefits (see PG. 529).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1544" id="footnote-ref-1544">[1544]</a></sup></sup>Please note that BEFORE you are actually convicted—even if you are incarcerated while awaiting trial—you will continue to receive Social Security benefits until you are convicted AND incarcerated for 30 days or more in a row.<sup><a href="#footnote-1545" id="footnote-ref-1545">[1545]</a></sup></p>

<p class="sidebox">As soon as you know that you will be incarcerated for 30 or more days, you should report this fact to Social Security so that your benefits get suspended in a timely way.

<h4 class="textbox">Getting SSDI on the Day You Apply</h4>
<p class="textbox">In SPECIAL EMERGENCY CASES, you may be able to get benefits on the day you walk into the local Social Security office to complete your SSDI paperwork.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153357"></a>How SSI affects your ability to get other public benefits:</h3>
<ol class="text">If you get SSI, you can’t also get CalFresh, since SSI is supposed to cover food expenses.<sup><a href="#footnote-1611" id="footnote-ref-1611">[1611]</a></sup> However, other people in your household may be eligible and your income will not count in determining their eligibility. If you get SSI, you’ll be automatically enrolled in Medi-Cal (see PG. 511) and may qualify for extra help with paying for Medicare (see PG. 516). SSI recipients who do not have access to a kitchen or have a kitchen but no stove or refrigerator are eligible for additional food benefits through SSI. You are not considered as having access to a kitchen unless you have a working refrigerator or icebox and a stove with at least two working burners.<sup><a href="#footnote-1612" id="footnote-ref-1612">[1612]</a></sup> Depending on your work history, you may be eligible to get retirement benefits (see PG. 525) and/or SSDI (see PG. 530) in addition to SSI.<sup><a href="#footnote-1613" id="footnote-ref-1613">[1613]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153358"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get SSI?</h3>
<p class="text">Possibly—but this could be just temporary. You can’t get SSI for any month that you:<sup><a href="#footnote-1614" id="footnote-ref-1614">[1614]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Are confined in a correctional facility for that full calendar month; Have an outstanding arrest warrant because you’re avoiding prosecution or confinement for a felony; orAre found to be violating a condition of probation or parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-1615" id="footnote-ref-1615">[1615]</a></sup> <em>Here is an example of how this works:</em> If you went to jail on October 30, 2014 until November 2, 2014, you weren’t entitled to SSI benefits for the months of October or November.<sup><a href="#footnote-1616" id="footnote-ref-1616">[1616]</a></sup> This means you can’t collect “back payments” for SSI benefits that you would have received if you never had a violation, warrant, and/or period of confinement as described in the three situations above.<sup><a href="#footnote-1617" id="footnote-ref-1617">[1617]</a></sup> Additionally, your benefits will be paused for up to one year. After that, they will be ended and you will need to re-apply (see PG. 539 below).Also, you can’t apply for any Social Security benefits based on a disability that is related to a felony you committed. For example, if you fell while committing a felony and lost your ability to walk as a result, that disability won’t qualify you for SSI.<sup><a href="#footnote-1618" id="footnote-ref-1618">[1618]</a></sup> But you could still apply for SSI based on a disability that has no connection to your felony.</ol>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153363"></a>I believe my SSI was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal?</h3>
<p class="text">Many people who apply for SSI are denied at first, but then get benefits once they appeal.

<ol class="text">You have a right to appeal. To do so, you must file a Request for Reconsideration within 60 days after the date you got the notice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1642" id="footnote-ref-1642">[1642]</a></sup> You can send it by mail, but it’s best to file it in person at a local Social Security office.

<p class="text">Even though you only receive a portion of your service-related benefit while incarcerated, the balance, or full amount, of the benefit may be “apportioned” to your family member during the period of incarceration.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1686" id="footnote-ref-1686">[1686]</a></sup></sup> For example, if you are 50% service-connected, you would only be entitled to receive 10% while incarcerated. However, your family may be apportioned the remaining 40% of the benefit. Either you or your family member may apply for apportionment using VA Form 21-0788. The amount apportioned will be determined based on need. In determining need, the VA considers factors such as the appointee’s income, living expenses and any other relevant factors. Apportionment may not be granted retroactively. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Notifying the VA about Your Incarceration and Release:</p>
<ul class="importantbox">You are required to notify the VA when you go to jail or prison. The VA needs to know whether and when to reduce or stop your benefits. If you receive larger or more VA payments than you’re legally entitled to receive while incarcerated, the VA will require that you eventually repay the total amount that you should not have received—your “overpayment.” Basically, after you’re released from incarceration and once again eligible for benefits, the VA will withhold all your benefits until the overpayment is paid off.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1687" id="footnote-ref-1687">[1687]</a></sup></strong>You should notify the VA within a year after your release—in advance, if possible. The VA will assume that you remain incarcerated until you submit proof of your release date. The VA needs this proof before it can restore or restart your benefits.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1688" id="footnote-ref-1688">[1688]</a></sup></strong> The VA periodically identifies people receiving VA benefits who are incarcerated or in violation of parole or probation via listings that it receives from the U. S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and other sources. However, these listings may have errors regarding your dates of incarceration, so it is helpful for you to be in direct contact with the VA to correct any inaccurate information.</ul>
<p class="importantbox">Note, you can use VA Form 21-4193 to notify the VA of your incarceration and release dates. (See copy of form in Appendix J, PG. 585.) If you’re incarcerated, you can get this form from a correctional counselor. If you have Internet access, download the form at <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?documentID=203887&amp;version=1"><strong>www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?documentID=203887&amp;version=1</strong></a>. You can also call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 and ask that the form be mailed to you. The form must be signed by a correctional official.</p>
<h3><a id="PublicBenefits_VABenefits_Retore"></a><a id="_Toc448153370"></a>My VA benefits were reduced or stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restore or restart my VA benefits?</h3>
<h4>For disability compensation or pension benefits:</h4>
<ol class="text">The VA will not automatically resume paying benefits at the full amount once you are released. Once you have a release date, contact the VA as early as 30 days before that date. Provide official proof of your release date, such as VA Form 21-4193 (see Appendix J, PG. 585) or your parole papers.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1689" id="footnote-ref-1689">[1689]</a></sup></sup> As long as you notify the VA within one year following your release, you’ll receive benefits dating back to your release date.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1690" id="footnote-ref-1690">[1690]</a></sup></sup> The VA will backdate your benefits to the date of release if you provide the VA with proof of your release within one year of your release. If you do not provide notification of your release within one year, your benefits will only be retroactive to the date of the notification.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1691" id="footnote-ref-1691">[1691]</a></sup></sup>You can use VA Form 21-4193 to notify the VA of your incarceration and/or release. (See Appendix J, PG. 585.) If you’re incarcerated, you can get this form from a correctional counselor.

You can also call 1-800-827-1000 and ask that the form be mailed to you. The form must be signed by a correctional official to be valid as proof.</ol>
<h4>For health care benefits: </h4>
<ol class="text">If you don’t have your Veteran Identification Card, and/or if you plan to access services at a VA health care facility you haven’t visited before, complete VA Form 10-10EZ (see Appendix I, PG. 580) and send it to that facility. Doing this at least 6 months before your release can help ensure you’ll have access to health care when you get out.<sup><a href="#footnote-1692" id="footnote-ref-1692">[1692]</a></sup> You can request this form by calling or writing to any VA health care facility, or by calling 1-877-222-8387.<sup><a href="#footnote-1693" id="footnote-ref-1693">[1693]</a></sup>If you have your Veteran Identification Card, and if you plan to access services at a VA health care facility you’ve visited before, you should be able to access services there without submitting any forms.<sup><a href="#footnote-1694" id="footnote-ref-1694">[1694]</a></sup> </ol>
<h4>Debts owed to the VA caused by incarceration: </h4>
<ol class="text">If you were paid VA benefits after your 61<sup>st</sup> day of incarceration you may have an overpayment. An overpayment may prevent you from receiving the full benefit amount to which you are entitled after you are released. Whenever an overpayment is established in any program under the jurisdiction of the Veterans Benefits Administration, the Debt Management Center (DMC) at the St. Paul, Minnesota, VA Regional Office assumes responsibility over your debt. The VA DMC may be contacted by mail<sup><a href="#footnote-1695" id="footnote-ref-1695">[1695]</a></sup> or by calling 1-800-827-0648.<sup><a href="#footnote-1696" id="footnote-ref-1696">[1696]</a></sup>You may request a waiver of your debt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1697" id="footnote-ref-1697">[1697]</a></sup> The VA does not require the use of a specific form to request a waiver.<sup><a href="#footnote-1698" id="footnote-ref-1698">[1698]</a></sup> The time limit for requesting waiver of an overpayment is 180 days from the date you are first advised of the existence of the overpayment and the notification specifies the amount of the debt. A request for waiver should be submitted to the DMC with a completed financial status report using VA Form 20-5655.If the VA incorrectly calculated your dates of incarceration, you may challenge the validity of the debt or the effective date of the debt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1699" id="footnote-ref-1699">[1699]</a></sup> There is no official form for disputing the validity of the debt. </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153371"></a>I’m disqualified from VA benefits because of my negative discharge status. How can I have my discharge status reviewed for an upgrade? </h3>
<p class="text">These requests are rarely granted, so you may want to get help.If you left the military <em>less than 15 years ago</em>, apply for a “Review of Discharge or Dismissal” using Department of Defense’s DD Form 293 (see copy of form in Appendix K, PG. 587.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1700" id="footnote-ref-1700">[1700]</a></sup></sup> You can also have the form mailed to you by calling the VA at 1-703-607-1600; or by sending a written request to: Army Review Boards Agency; ATTN: Client Information and Quality Assurance; Arlington, VA 22202-4508. Alternatively, obtain DD Form 293 from a VA regional office, or online at <a href="http://www.usapa.army.mil">http://www.usapa.army.mil</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1701" id="footnote-ref-1701">[1701]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text">The Review Board will grant your uPGrade request only if your discharge reason was “inequitable” (not consistent with the policies and traditions of the service) or “improper” (based on error, or violating a law or regulation). With your application form, include written statements and records that help prove this.<sup><a href="#footnote-1702" id="footnote-ref-1702">[1702]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">If you left the military <em>more than 15 years ago</em>, apply for a Correction of Military Records using DD Form 149 (see copy of form in Appendix L, PG. 592).<sup><a href="#footnote-1703" id="footnote-ref-1703">[1703]</a></sup>You can also have the form mailed to you by calling the VA at 1-703-607-1600; or by sending a written request to: Army Review Boards Agency; ATTN: Client Information and Quality Assurance; Arlington, VA 22202-4508. Alternatively, obtain DD Form 149 from a VA regional office, or online at <a href="http://www.usapa.army.mil">www.usapa.army.mil</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1704" id="footnote-ref-1704">[1704]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Generally, you must request a correction within 3 years of discovering an “error” or “injustice” in your record. However, if the Board for Correction finds it is “in the interest of justice” to excuse a late request, it may do so. If your request is late, you must explain why your application was delayed, and why it’s in the interest of justice for the Board to consider it despite the delay. </ol>
<h4 class="sidebox">INTEREST OF JUSTICE?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">In the majority cases, former service members are simply unaware of the 3-year filing deadline. If this is true in your case, say so! If not, briefly explain why you are filing late, and why it would unfair for the Board of Corrections to not consider your application.</p>
<ol class="text">The Board for Correction will grant your request if you show that something in the record is inaccurate or unjust. With your application form, include ALL available evidence that helps to prove this, such as signed witness statements, personnel records, or a brief of arguments supporting the correction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1705" id="footnote-ref-1705">[1705]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">Because these applications are rarely granted, you should consider the following options to get help: </p>
<ol class="text">Contact a local veteran service organization to see if any staff can help you complete the forms and/or represent you. Find a legal aid lawyer who specializes in discharge reviews.Using the contact information provided on the form (see DD 293 or DD 149, whichever applied to you), contact the Review Board to discuss your case and ask questions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1706" id="footnote-ref-1706">[1706]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have an undesirable, other than honorable (OTH), or a bad conduct discharge, you may be eligible for VA benefits if the VA determines that your service was “other than dishonorable” through the <em>Character of Discharge</em> administrative process.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1707" id="footnote-ref-1707">[1707]</a></sup></strong></p>
<ul class="importantbox">You may apply for a Character of Discharge determination by applying for any VA benefit. The VA will only consider your time in service in making the determination.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1708" id="footnote-ref-1708">[1708]</a></sup></strong>You will not be eligible for a favorable determination if you are statutorily barred from benefits.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1709" id="footnote-ref-1709">[1709]</a></sup></strong>The VA may consider any number of factors in deciding whether to grant a favorable decision, including, your length of service, whether you deployed to a combat zone, whether you were diagnosed with a medical condition prior to or shortly after discharge, and any other relevant factors.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1710" id="footnote-ref-1710">[1710]</a></sup></strong></ul>
<h2><a id="PB_LifeLineCellPhones"></a><a id="_Toc448153372"></a>LifeLine Cell Phone &amp; Landline Benefits</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153373"></a>What is the LifeLine Phone program?</h3>
<p class="text">The LifeLine phone program is a government-funded program that provides free monthly telephone service (cell or landline) to eligible California residents – those for whom California is their permanent home.<sup><a href="#footnote-1711" id="footnote-ref-1711">[1711]</a></sup>Both the state government and federal government offer LifeLine programs, and if you qualify, you have your choice of participating in either.<sup><a href="#footnote-1712" id="footnote-ref-1712">[1712]</a></sup> In this guide, we discuss only the <em>California LifeLine program</em>, since this guide is a California legal guide.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) sponsors the California LifeLine program by proving affordable local home telephone service to qualifying low-income persons.<sup><a href="#footnote-1713" id="footnote-ref-1713">[1713]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153374"></a>What benefits will the California LifeLine program provide?</h3>
<p class="text">If you qualify for the California LifeLine program, you will receive a phone (either a landline or cell phone—your decision) and a service plan with a set amount of minutes; for cell phones, you will also receive a set amount of text messages you can send each month for free.<sup><a href="#footnote-1714" id="footnote-ref-1714">[1714]</a></sup>You can pay an additional discounted monthly rate if you would like to get extra minutes, texts, or data added to your plan (NOTE: data can be used to access the Internet and e-mail on your cell phone). The cost depends on the carrier company and the amount of extra services you request. Different phone service companies will offer competing plans, and it is up to you to select the provider that best suits your needs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1715" id="footnote-ref-1715">[1715]</a></sup>A list of California LifeLine providers can be found online at: <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search">https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search</a>, OR you can call the <a id="PB_Phone_CALifelineCallCenterContactInfo"></a>California LifeLine Call Center for general information about the program at the applicable phone number below.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153375"></a>Am I eligible for the California LifeLine program?</h3>
<p class="text">Eligibility for the California Lifeline phone program can be based on one of two different factors: (1) the low-income assistance programs (called program-based eligibility), OR (2) by meeting certain total household income limit requirements (called income-based eligibility). Go to <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=2752">http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=2752#qualify</a> for a list of federal and state assistance (public benefits) programs that meet the <em>program-based eligibility requirements, </em>and for a chart that explains how much you can make to meet <em>income-based eligibility requirements</em>.Only one LifeLine telephone line is allowed per “household.” For this program, a “household” member is defined as any adult (over 18 years old or an emancipated minor) living with you and sharing income and household expenses. Go to <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/household_worksheets/st_en_10_hh.pdf">https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/household_worksheets/st_en_10_hh.pdf</a> to view  a sample worksheet to help you figure out if you qualify as one “household.” To view a sample of the <em>California Lifeline Eligibility Guidelines</em> form, see <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_eg_0615.pdf">https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_eg_0615.pdf</a>. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153376"></a>How do I apply for the California LifeLine program?</h3>
<h4 class="step">First select a participating telephone company. If you already use a specific phone company, it may already participate in the LifeLine program (you can call the company and ask), or you may select a <em>new</em> telephone company that serves your area by searching online at: <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search"><strong>https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search</strong></a>.</h4>
<ol class="text">Remember, different phone companies provide different service plans, so you might want to shop around!</ol>
<h4 class="step">The telephone company will give you a Lifeline application form, with an Enrollment Code and/or a Personal Identification Number (PIN) in a pink envelope. To view a copy of a sample California LifeLife application form, go to <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_0114.pdf"><strong>https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_0114.pdf</strong></a>.In order to receive the California LifeLine benefits, you must complete this form, sign it, and send it to the California LifeLine Administrator along with any required documents by the due date listed on the form. You may also apply online at <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/en/login"><strong>https://www.californialifeline.com/en/login</strong></a></h4>
<ol class="text">Next, the telephone company will confirm your identity and whether you meet the one phone per household requirement, and then process your application.If you have any additional questions about your application, status, or due dates, please call the California LifeLine Administrator's hotline at 1-866-272-0349.What documents do I need to be found eligible?</ol>
<p class="text">First, you will need documents that prove who you are (your identity) to the phone company. You may need to show your Social Security card, birth certificate, and/or unexpired Driver License. For a complete list of acceptable forms of ID, see <a href="http://www.californialifeline.com">www.californialifeline.com</a>, or call 1-877-858-7463. See https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/identity/st_en_10_nc_id_0915.pdf for a “Sample ID Authentication Form”.<sup><a href="#footnote-1716" id="footnote-ref-1716">[1716]</a></sup>Second, you will need to prove that you require financial assistance. One way to prove this is to show that you receive public benefits from a qualifying state or federal assistance program. You may need to show a copy of your benefits program agreement or benefit card.<sup><a href="#footnote-1717" id="footnote-ref-1717">[1717]</a></sup>Finally, if you want to prove your eligibility based on your income, you must provide an official document proving your income—for example, an income statement from an employer, a prior year's tax return, a Social Security income statement, a Veterans Administration income statement, and/or a document proving you receive unemployment or some other public benefits. See https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_eg_0615.pdf  for a complete list.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153377"></a>Can my criminal backround limit my ability to get a California Lifeline phone?</h3>
<p class="text">No. Having a criminal record does not affect your eligibility for the California LifeLine phone program.<em>SPECIAL POLICY NOTE FOR PEOPLE UNDER FEDERAL SUPERVISION (for example, federal probation, supervised release, or federal parole):</em><br/>On September 9, 2014, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that all federal halfway houses are <em>required</em> to allow their residents to have cell phones, so that people in reentry can pursue job opportunities and connect with family.<sup><a href="#footnote-1718" id="footnote-ref-1718">[1718]</a></sup> If you are on federal supervision, you must still meet the same standard eligibility requirements for the California LifeLine phone program, just like anyone else.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153378"></a>Can I apply for a California LifeLine phone while incarcerated?</h3>
<p class="text">No. You are required to provide a <em>residential address</em> (the location where you a living) to apply for the California LifeLine program. Giving just a “P.O. Box” address is insufficient.<sup><a href="#footnote-1719" id="footnote-ref-1719">[1719]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153379"></a>How do I receive my phone and Lifeline benefits?</h3>
<p class="text">After you are enrolled in the California LifeLine program, your specific phone carrier will supply you with a phone and instructions on how to activate it. Your benefits will start as soon as you activate your phone.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153380"></a>Once enrolled, what rules must I follow to remain eligible?</h3>
<p class="text">Aside from meeting the <em>program-based</em> or <em>income-based</em> guidelines, you cannot apply for more than one Lifeline phone per household, as previously discussed.If you do not follow this rule, you will lose your Lifeline phone and benefits, and you may be prosecuted by the federal government. This also means that you cannot be claimed as a dependent on anybody else's income tax return, and that you may not transfer your Lifeline discount to anyone else.<sup><a href="#footnote-1720" id="footnote-ref-1720">[1720]</a></sup>Also, you must recertify yourself as eligible once each year. This can be done either online at <a href="http://www.californialifeline.com">www.californialifeline.com</a> using your PIN, or by letter to: California LifeLine Administrator, P.O. Box 8417, Westminster, CA 92684.See a sample California LifeLine program renewal form at https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/renewals/st_en_10_ren_0114.pdf.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153381"></a>I believe my LifeLine phone was wrongly denied or wrongly stopped service. How do I appeal?</h3>
<p class="text">You can appeal (challenge) a denial or disqualification (when LifeLine stops your phone service) by calling the California Public Utility Commission’s (CPUC) Consumer Affairs Branch at phone number 1-800-649-7570.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153382"></a>What if I have additional questions or problems?</h3>
