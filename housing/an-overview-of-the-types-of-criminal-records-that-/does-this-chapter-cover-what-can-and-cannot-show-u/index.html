          <p class="text">No, not really. As a general note, whenever you apply to ANY type of housing—whether you’re applying to private housing (run by a private landlord) OR to government-assisted housing (through a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or directly to an owner of government-assisted housing)—all of these people and agencies CAN access your <em>credit report</em>, which is <em>different</em> from your criminal records, but might be combined in a “tenant report” (which is just a background for housing).</p>
          <p class="text"><em>Credit reports</em> include information about your past finances and credit history, such as whether you have a history of paying bills on time. Credit reports also show whether past credit problems have ended in a bankruptcy or a court proceeding for failing to pay your rent on time (called an “eviction” or an “unlawful detainer” ). A credit report shows ONLY credit information, NOT criminal history information. <em>We included some very general rules about credit reports in </em>Appendix F<em>, PG. 488 of this chapter, but these rules are only a summary. This Chapter is focused on how criminal records come up as you apply for housing, not past credit issues.</em></p>
