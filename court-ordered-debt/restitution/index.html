          <h1>Restitution</h1>
          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153535"></a>Restitution</h2>
          <h3><a id="COD_Restitution_PayingWhileIncarcerated"></a><a id="_Toc448153536"></a>How do I pay restitution while incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">CDCR (or the county jail) will automatically deduct victim restitution, and, if possible, restitution fine payments from deposits in your trust account and any wages you earn.<sup><a href="#footnote-2184" id="footnote-ref-2184">[2153]</a></sup> You can also make voluntary payments whenever you like.</p>
          <p class="text">If a friend or family member on the outside sends you money, the CDCR will automatically apply half of the sum to your restitution, with an additional ten percent of that half going towards paying administrative costs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2185" id="footnote-ref-2185">[2154]</a></sup> Friends and family on the outside can also send you money specifically for restitution, in which case the administrative costs are waived.<sup><a href="#footnote-2186" id="footnote-ref-2186">[2155]</a></sup> </p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153537"></a>How do I pay restitution while on state parole? </h3>
          <p class="text">CDCR has most likely sent your victim restitution debt to the Franchise Tax Board for collection. The FTB will send you a demand notice with contact information and instructions on how to set up a payment plan. You can also contact the FTB directly to make payment arrangements. (See PG. 840 for FTB contact information.) If you also want to pay off your restitution fines (or parole revocation fines) voluntarily while you are on parole, you can send these payments directly to CDCR. Your parole agent can tell you how much you owe and/or answer other questions about your payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2187" id="footnote-ref-2187">[2156]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">Make sure you include your name and CDCR number with your payment, and send to:</p>
          <p class="address">CDCR—Office of Trust AccountingP.O. Box 276088Sacramento, CA 95827</p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You must pay off your restitution in full to transfer your parole from California to another state, otherwise your transfer request will be denied.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2188" id="footnote-ref-2188">[2157]</a></sup></sup> Once you pay off your restitution, your parole agent will request a receipt showing a zero balance to submit with your transfer request. </p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153538"></a>How do I pay restitution while on probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision in California? </h3>
          <p class="text">You should ask your probation officer about making payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2190" id="footnote-ref-2190">[2158]</a></sup> You can also call the CDCR Office of Victim &amp; Survivor Rights &amp; Services Restitution Unit at (877) 256-6877 (toll free) to discuss your restitution balance and arrange your payments. </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: PAY OFF CONDITION-OF-PROBATION DEBTS FIRST! Always try to pay off debts that are <em>conditions of your probation</em> first, as these can affect the length of your probation.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2191" id="footnote-ref-2191">[2159]</a></sup></sup></strong> (Payments are supposed to go to these debts first automatically, but this doesn’t always happen.)<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2192" id="footnote-ref-2192">[2160]</a></sup></strong>BUT NOTE: If you are entitled to a mandatory dismissal of a conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4 because your probation was terminated (ended) early, you cannot be denied the dismissal because you still owe victim restitution.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2193" id="footnote-ref-2193">[2161]</a></sup></sup></strong> This means that if you owe victim restitution, you still have the RIGHT to a mandatory dismissal of a qualifying conviction. See PG 1168 in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER for more information.</p>
          <p class="text">Make your payments in-person, online, or by mail:</p>
          <ol class="text"><em>If you make a payment in person</em>, ask the clerk (or collections representative) who receives your payment to put it toward your restitution and any other fines imposed as conditions of your probation first.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>If you make payments online</em>, you can select which fines or fees your payment will go toward. Make sure you select the ones that are conditions of your probation first.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>If send your payment by mail</em>, write on your check or money order in the memo line—or include a note—that indicates which fine or fee the payment is specifically meant for.</ol>
          <p class="text"><em>After you are off state parole</em>, CDCR will refer the remainder of your debt (unpaid restitution fines, parole revocation restitution, court fines and fees, administrative fees) to the California Franchise Tax Board.<sup><a href="#footnote-2194" id="footnote-ref-2194">[2162]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a href="/roadmap-to-html/court-ordered-debt/restitution/what-will-happen-if-i-cant-pay-the-restitution/">What will happen if I can’t pay the restitution?</a></h3>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448153539"></a>What will happen if I can’t pay the restitution?</h3>
              <p class="text">It depends who you owe the restitution to.</p>
              <p class="text"><a id="COD_Pay_FranchiseTaxBoard_incharge"></a>If the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) is in charge of collecting your restitution debt, here are some steps you can take to possibly make your financial situation easier:</p>
              <ol class="text">Set Up a Payment Plan: Contact the FTB to discuss your options for paying your debt in installments instead of all at once;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Manage Your Payments Online: Set up an online account to instantly view your current balance, make payments, and keep records of the debt you have already paid.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Get Your Payments Reduced: If the FTB is taking too much money out of your paycheck (called “wage garnishment”) and you don’t have enough to live on, you can claim financial hardship and ask the FTB to reduce the amount being taken out of each paycheck. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2195" id="footnote-ref-2195">[2163]</a></sup></sup> (Note: The FTB can only lower the amount taken from each payment, but cannot reduce the total amount of debt that you owe.) (See PG. 824 for more information on wage garnishment.) </ol>
              <ol class="text">Dispute the Amount You Owe: If you disagree with the AMOUNT of debt you owe, you will need to contact the local court or county collection agency listed on your demand notice (the document notifying you that you owe money) directly. The FTB can help you lower the amount you pay each month, but it CANNOT answer questions or make changes to your total debt orders.</ol>
              <p class="textbox"><em>The California FTB employs representatives to help you. </em>You can call the FTB at (916) 845-4064 during normal weekday hours (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.) or visit the FTB’s website at: <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/index.asp">https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/index.asp</a>.<strong>Can my public benefit payments be garnished to pay off restitution?</strong>Yes. At least when it comes to Social Security, the court is authorized to order garnishment of public benefits as a means of paying off victim restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2196" id="footnote-ref-2196">[2164]</a></sup> The government agency that provides the public benefit can garnish a maximum of 25 percent of your monthly benefit amount.<sup><a href="#footnote-2197" id="footnote-ref-2197">[2165]</a></sup> <strong>The victim NEVER CLAIMED RESTITUTION. DO I STILL HAVE TO PAY?</strong>Yes. The CDCR is in charge of managing restitution accounts for direct orders, even once you are released. Most of the time, the CDCR does not initially have an address for the victim to which they can direct payments. In such a case, depending on your custody status, either the CDCR or the Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board hangs onto the payments until the victim can be located.  State law permits victims to come forward at any time to claim restitution collected on their behalf.<sup><a href="#footnote-2198" id="footnote-ref-2198">[2166]</a></sup> <strong>The victim who was receiving my restitution payments just died. Do I still have to pay?</strong>Yes. If you were ordered to pay restitution directly to the victim of a crime (“direct order”), and that victim has died, the executor or administrator of the victim’s estate will begin receiving restitution payments on his or her behalf.<sup><a href="#footnote-2199" id="footnote-ref-2199">[2167]</a></sup> Of course, restitution can only be awarded for economic losses the victim incurred before he or she died, so any additional economic losses incurred after or as a result of the victim’s death are not your responsibility.<sup><a href="#footnote-2200" id="footnote-ref-2200">[2168]</a></sup></p>
