  <p>
    Can I apply for VA benefits while incarcerated?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. Although your eligibility for VA benefits may be limited or cut off during incarceration, there are various VA benefits you can apply for while incarcerated. There are certain benefits you can apply for and receive in full while incarcerated; and there are certain other benefits you should start applying for while incarcerated so that you can access them immediately upon your release. Information about some of these benefits is provided below. Contact the VA at 1-800-827-1000 (TDD 1-800-829-4833) for further details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Overview of VA benefits You Can (& Can’t) Apply for While Incarcerated:VA Benefits You CAN Apply for:VA Benefits You CAN’T Apply For:Service-related disability compensation, disability pensions, dependency benefits, and death benefits[1680] Apportionment of benefits if incarcerated for a non-felony. This means you can ask the VA to pay your dependent(s) some or all of the benefits that you can’t receive while incarcerated.[1681] You or your dependent(s) must complete VA Form 21-0788 (see Appendix H, on PG. 672)[1682] and submit it to a VA Regional Office.[1683] You CAN apply for education benefits while incarcerated:For a non-felony, you can get full monthly education benefits.[1684]For a felony, you can get benefits to cover the costs of your tuition, fees, and necessary books and supplies—if no other government program is covering these costs.[1685] You can’t apply for or receive any non-service-related pension benefits while incarcerated for a felony.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    compensation and pension examination?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even if you are incarcerated, the VA is obligated to provide you with a compensation and pension examination when one is required (see VA Fast Letter 11-22, Examinations for Incarcerated Veterans and Veterans Health Administration (Sept. 8, 2011)). You have the right to have a medical professional perform the examination at the facility where you are incarcerated (see Bolton v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 185 (1995).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pre-release steps for securing VA health care (& other benefits): 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meet with your region’s Re-entry Specialist. Every region of the U.S. has a VA Re-entry Specialist who can help determine your eligibility for VA benefits. He/she can also help you enroll, restart disability benefits, getting your DD-214 (explained below), and connecting you with services. Your region’s Re-entry Specialist should be scheduled to visit your facility at least yearly.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Enroll with the VA. Do this by visiting with a Re-entry Specialist, OR by submitting a VA Form 10-10EZ by mail (see copy of form in Appendix I, PG. 672). If your release date is within 6 months and you haven’t seen a Re-entry Specialist, enroll by mail to ensure timely access to services. To request a form, write to a VA Enrollment Office near your place of release (directory online at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide), and mail back your completed form with “VA Enrollment” written on the envelope.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOT INCARCERATED?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re participating in a work-release program, living in a halfway house, or under community supervision as part of your felony sentence, the VA considers you NOT incarcerated.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Get a copy of your “DD-214: Report of Separation.” Have this ready before release. This is your proof of military service, and it’s a key to your access to job opportunities, community resources, and health care. To request your DD-214, write to: National Personnel Records Center; 1 Archives Drive; St. Louis, MO 63136.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    File for service-related disability compensation or disability pension, if that applies to you.[1686]
