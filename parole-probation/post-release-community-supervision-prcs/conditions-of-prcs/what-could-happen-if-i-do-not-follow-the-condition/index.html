  <p>
    What could happen if I do not follow the conditions of my PRCS?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are different types of consequences for not following (violating) the terms and conditions of your post-release community supervision (PRCS). These include:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS: PRCS agencies are supposed to develop and use “intermediate sanctions” for minor violations of PRCS conditions. Intermediate sanctions could include programs like drug treatment, mental health counseling, and job assistance.[661]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    FLASH INCARCERATION: Another type of punishment for violating a PRCS condition is “flash incarceration.” Flash incarceration is an immediate return to jail for a period of up to 10 days.[662] One of the conditions for being placed on PRCS is that you give up the right to demand a court hearing before being subject to flash incarceration.[663] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    COURT PETITION TO MODIFY/REVOKE/TERMINATE PRCS: If the PRCS supervising agency (the county probation office) decides that more serious punishment is appropriate for the violation, the agency will file a petition to modify, revoke, or terminate PRCS through the County Superior Court. The probation office’s petition will be filed with a hearing officer appointed by the local Superior Court. Either the supervising agency (probation department) or the hearing officer can decide to keep a person in custody (in jail) while the petition is pending.[664]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    HOW DO I PROVE PERMANENT RESIDENCE?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to verify that you live in the requested county, the county probation department will need proof of permanent residence. This may include:A face-to-face visit from a probation officer at your new homeA California driver’s license with your new addressVoter registration documentsA copy of a rental agreementA form from a friend or family member verifying that you will live with themCredit card or utility billsCar registration or insurance documentsNOTE: transitional housing does NOT count as permanent residence.
