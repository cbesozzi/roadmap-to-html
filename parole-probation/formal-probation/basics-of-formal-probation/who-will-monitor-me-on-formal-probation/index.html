    Who will monitor me on formal probation?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Depending on the circumstances, either the court (and the judge of that court) or a probation officer will monitor you to make sure you follow your probation conditions.[625] Generally, you must report to the probation officer once a month, although the judge could require you to report more or less often than that.[626] It is very important to remain in contact with your probation officer, or it could trigger a probation violation hearing. In some counties, your probation officer may allow you to report to them through a kiosk at a local probation office. [627]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT! How formal probation operates, and what services are available, varies from county to county. Ask your probation officer what is available to you in your county.
