  <p>
    Can the prosecutor (d.a.) introduce evidence that was obtained in violation of my fourth amendment right against unlawful search & seizure at my probation revocation proceeding?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes.[734] You should note that the “exclusionary rule” that usually applies in a criminal court trial—a rule that bars evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—does NOT apply in probation revocation hearings. This means that even if evidence was suppressed in an earlier criminal trial, it can still most likely be brought in to a later parole revocation hearing.[735]
