          <p class="text">Adult high school diploma programs may be available in adult schools or community colleges near you for free or at low cost. Many schools provide adult high school classes for free, and provide books and materials for free as well. Others may charge registration and tuition fees. (However, schools that charge fees may also offer financial aid to low-income students. Check with each school about fees and financial aid.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2757" id="footnote-ref-2757">[2724]</a></sup> Also, community adult literacy programs may offer high school diploma courses and tutoring for free. (For a list of organizations that may offer this service, see Appendix A, PG. 1093.) </p>
          <p class="text"><em>If you choose a</em> <em>distance learning </em>or <em>correspondence program</em>, regardless of whether you’re incarcerated or in the community, you may need to pay program fees and buy your own materials (for details about distance learning programs in general, see PG. 1076).</p>
          <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Be careful when choosing a high school diploma program. In recent years, the federal government has shut down several degree programs that were charging money for fake diplomas.<sup><a href="#footnote-2758" id="footnote-ref-2758">[2725]</a></sup> These programs are scams. To avoid being scammed by a fake diploma program, watch out for the following clues<sup><a href="#footnote-2759" id="footnote-ref-2759">[2726]</a></sup>:The program seems too good to be true. <strong>Getting a high school diploma requires time and effort. If a program lets you get a diploma without taking classes or tests, it is probably fake. </strong>The program offers free tests or classes, but charges for the diploma itself. <strong>This is a dead giveaway that the program is illegitimate. </strong>The program claims to be affilitated with the federal government.<strong> The federal government does not offer high school diploma progams. Only the states approve such programs.</strong></p>
