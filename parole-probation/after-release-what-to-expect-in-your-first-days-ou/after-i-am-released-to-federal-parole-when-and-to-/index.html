          <h1>After I am released to federal parole, when and to whom must I report?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153056"></a>After I am released to federal parole, when and to whom must I report?</h3>
          <p>US. Probation Officers function as parole officers and provide supervision to persons released on parole or on mandatory release.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-926" id="footnote-ref-926">[900]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">You will go to <em>an approved residence</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-927" id="footnote-ref-927">[901]</a></sup></sup> and report <em>within 3 days</em> (72 hours) to the United States Probation Office shown on your <em>certificate of release</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-928" id="footnote-ref-928">[902]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">You must continue to report to a U.S. Probation Officer in-person as instructed by your officer once released. </ol>
          <ol class="text">In addition, you must submit a monthly written report, and follow all the conditions of your release.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-929" id="footnote-ref-929">[903]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">Constitutional Concerns about detainers</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">State and local corrections officials frequently violate the 48-hour limitation by continuing to hold individuals beyond the period allowed by regulation, raising constitutional concerns. Detainers have resulted in the illegal imprisonment of many people—including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, without any charges pending, sometimes for days or weeks after they should have been released from custody.</p>
          <ol class="text">U.S. Probation Officers must also provide you with parole services at the request of the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-930" id="footnote-ref-930">[904]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
