The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library.The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.

I was in the San Mateo County Jail waiting to be sentenced to Federal Prison, when I first heard this quote. I remember saying time and time again how I was going to be different the next time. So many promises were made during those lonely moments that I never thought of how I was going to keep those promises if I wasn’t doing anything different. Life, I thought, doesn’t have to be the same for me. Blind faith, they told me, is what you need in order to trust those who are trying to teach you a different way to live.Unfortunately, in jails and in prisons, if you want rehabilitation, you have to seek it out. The same is true when you get out. The difference when you are out is that you have the power to choose when, how, and where, and although at times you might get discouraged because it seems overwhelming, don't give up. Remember, nobody said the climb was going to be easy.Now that we are free to choose, let's take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us. Today, we no longer have to abide by any prison codes or rules, and if you keep doing the right thing, then the climb won't seem so lonely and treacherous, and the rewards will be enormous, as they have been for me.Keep in mind that the climb to anything, whether it's a mountain, a hill or a ladder, has to be taken carefully, cautiously and with an open mind. Each step we take has to be carefully guided and directed towards the direction that will cost us the least pain and regret. Even our old friends or acquaintances, although well intended, can bring us more harm than good, so carefully choose who you include in your circle. Cautiously approach any given situation, and when in doubt... don't. Luckily, we don't exist alone in the world, and regardless of who you are, you need someone. Collectively, rather than individually, we can accomplish more. So, have an open mind and pay attention to the message more than the messenger.Jails and Prisons don't have to be what defines us, or what breaks us; we choose who, what and where. Somehow, reaching the top is no longer that important, because the journey getting there is what will be embraced.Peace,Carmen</p><p><a id="Intro_Mindfulness"></a><strong>MINDFULNESS IN DAILY LIFE</strong></p><p><strong><em>5 PRACTICES TO DEVELOP CALM &amp; CLARITY</em></strong></p><p class="text">As we all know, the process of reentry is incredibly stressful. Taking time to breathe deeply, to be aware of and to care for your body and your emotions, can be a big help. Mindfulness can help you to stay focused, calm, and balanced. ‘Mindfulness’ is just a fancy work for being aware of our thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Studies have shown that mindfulness can help reduce stress and improve our health. The practices and resources below may help you stay balanced and optimistic during what can be a challenging process of reentry. We hope these tools are helpful to you on your journey through reentry and throughout your life.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>MINDFUL WALKING</strong></p><p class="text">As you walk from your car or train to an office, on your way to a meeting or job interview, try to be aware of your breath and body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest with your inhale and exhale, the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the sun or air on your skin. Try to leave early enough for your appointments so that your walk can be slow and unhurried. This simple practice can introduce greater calm into your day, and provide a few moments of relaxation before a potentially stressful situation.</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>SITTING MEDITATION</strong></p><p class="text">Simply sitting quietly, with eyes open or closed, following one’s breath, can be a powerful way to calm the mind and relax the body. Many people find this practice challenging at first, but that it becomes easier over time and provides tremendous benefits for body and mind. Start with just 5 minutes per day using one of the guided recordings listed below, or visit an introductory class at a local meditation center.</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>YOGA</strong></p><p class="text">Yoga is another powerful mindfulness practice that can help with reducing stress and improving physical and mental health. Local yoga studios often offer donation-based or community classes.</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>MINDFUL EATING</strong></p><p class="text">Mindful eating invites us to fully experience and enjoy our food. Whether eating alone or with others, taking time to see, smell, taste, and appreciate our food, and taking a break from TV, phones and work—can make meals a peaceful time to refocus and enjoy life.</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>4-7-8 BREATHING</strong></p><p class="text">Dr. Andrew Weil’s technique of deep breathing is a great way to calm the nervous system throughout the day. See www.drweil.com for details. The basic instruction is to inhale for four counts (“1, 2, 3, 4…”), hold for seven counts, and then slowly exhale for eight counts. Try doing five rounds of this breathing before bed and see how you feel.</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL MEDITATION RESOURCES:</strong></p><ol class="text">Guided meditation recordings at UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center: <a href="http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22">http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22</a> East Bay Meditation Center: a meditation center in Oakland provides numerous free and low-cost mindfulness programs. <a href="http://www.eastbaymeditation.org">www.eastbaymeditation.org</a> Yoga to the People: athletic, donation-based yoga with locations in Berkeley and San Francisco. <a href="http://www.yogatothepeople.com">www.yogatothepeople.com</a> International Vipassana Society: Donation-based meditation retreats offered at centers in Northern and Southern California. <a href="http://www.dhamma.org">http://www.dhamma.org</a></ol><p><a id="Into_ChapterSnapshots"></a><a id="Intro_ChapterSnapshots"></a><strong>CHAPTER SNAPSHOTS OF <em>ROADMAP TO REENTRY</em></strong></p><p class="text"><strong>CHAPTER 1: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: Getting ID &amp; Other Key Documents, Voting &amp; Civic Participation – PG. 21KEY TOPICS:</strong>What identification documents (ID) exist, and why they are important.An overview of key types of ID: birth certificates, Social Security numbers (SSN) and cards, CA State ID cards &amp; CA Driver Licenses, U.S. Passports, tribal ID cards, library cards, voter registration, and Selective Service registration.Which forms of ID are most important.When and how to get each ID document, and which documents to get first.How to get certain documents while incarcerated vs. after release.A summary of options for ID for undocumented people.Voting rights with a record and how to register to vote.Selective Service registration requirements and how to register.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>ID is necessary to access public benefits and services; apply for housing and employment; enroll in school and other programs.Need basic ID to apply for other indentification documents.Voting is a key civil right to choose the government officials and policies that impact society. <em>There are many myths &amp; misinformation about voting eligibility—and the law changed in 2015 in California!</em><strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>People in reentry have only a prison/jail ID card, which is of limited use in reentry.People in reentry lack necessary documents to apply and enroll in programs and services for which they are otherwise eligible.People with records have driver license holds, suspensions, &amp; revocations, often due to court-ordered debts that they don’t have the financial means to pay back. Certain convictions restrict a person’s access to a U.S. Passport.Because of their prisoner or parolee status, people are disenfranchised and lose the right to vote.People who do have the right to vote under law are wrongly informed or wrongly identified as having lost the right to vote—missing out on the chance to make their political voices heard.Men who were required to register with the Selective Service Registration between the ages of 18 and 26 missed the time window because they were incarcerated, and consequently are barred from accessing federal financial aid until they can prove their incapacity during the time they were supposed to have registered.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER 2: PAROLE &amp; PROBATION – PG. 130</strong></p><p class="text"><strong>KEY TOPICS:</strong>The many different types of supervision in California, which includes<em>STATE FORMS OF SUPERVISION:</em> <strong>state parole</strong>; <strong>county-level probation</strong> (formal and informal); and the new AB 109 forms of supervision including <strong>Mandatory Supervision</strong> and <strong>Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS)</strong>.<em>FEDERAL FORMS OF SUPERVISION</em>: <strong>federal probation</strong>, <strong>supervised release</strong>, and <strong>federal parole</strong>.Step-by-step instructions on what to do when a person is first released from prison or jail.The length of supervision terms as required by law, including how the length of time on supervision is calculated, and how to get off of supervision early if possible.The “conditions” (rules) of supervision, including <strong>general conditions</strong> that apply to all people on that type of supervision, and <strong>special or discretionary conditions</strong> that apply to only certain people.How to challenge special conditions (rules) of supervision.How to transfer someone’s supervision to another location—a different county, district, or state.The rights of people with disabilities to have reasonable accommodations, and what types of accommodations someone can ask for from his/her supervising officer.A person’s rights during violation &amp; revocation proceedings, and how the revocation process works.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>Supervision affects every aspect of life! <em>→ A person’s housing, employment, relationships with family &amp; children, schooling, etc.</em>People need to understand their rules of supervision to succeed in reentry, and to avoid new legal issues or re-incarceration.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Being on community supervision can create barriers in every aspect of a person’s life. For example, supervision rules can affect:<em>Housing:</em> Where a person can (or can’t) live &amp; with whom.<em>Employment:</em> Work opportunities, requirements &amp; restrictions.<em>Family:</em> Legal barriers to family reunification.<em>Education:</em> Restrictions and scheduling conflicts.<em>Basic liberties: </em>Some (not all) constitutional rights &amp; freedoms may be taken away—like travel restrictions &amp; being subject to searches and seizures at any time.<strong>CHAPTER 3: HOUSING – PG. 351KEY TOPICS:</strong>Different types of housing options and tips for the housing search.Short-term vs. long-term planning for where some can live in reentry.Housing application process, including bans or restrictions related to past convictions.What criminal records and other records private landlords vs. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and government-assisted housing providers can access.Joining family &amp; friends in housing – the differing rules of government-assisted housing providers (including PHAs) vs. private landlords.Challenging illegal housing denials by both government-assisted housing (including PHAs) &amp; private housing.Maintaining housing.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>Housing is the first thing people need when leaving prison or jail.Shelter is a basic human need.Having approved housing plans is often a requirement of someone’s conditions (rules) of supervision.Many housing-related restrictions &amp; barriers.Extremely high levels of homelessness among formerly incarcerated people.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Parole / probation housing requirements &amp; restrictions can include: residential restrictions, a requirement to live in transitional housing, etc.Private housing discrimination – Private landlords are hesitant to rent to people with criminal records, and may both legally and illegally discriminate depending on the indivudal circumstances, sometime violating fair housing law.Public &amp; government-assisted housing - criminal record restrictions exist, but may be overbroad and violate fair housing law.Housing-related barriers to family reunification that prevent people from living with family or friends – these exist in both private &amp; government-assisted housing.<strong>CHAPTER 4: PUBLIC BENEFITS – PG. 479KEY TOPICS:</strong>Public benefits programs, by type, including: Cash assistance; Food benefits; Health care; Work services; Social Security benefits; Veterans benefits; and cell phone benefits.Eligibility &amp; enrollment rules, including any restrictions based on criminal records for each public benefits program.What happens to benefits while incarcerated, and how to restart benefits after release.Applying for &amp; keeping benefits - How to apply for each type of benefits and how to deal with denials, disqualifications or terminations of benefits.Resources &amp; referrals.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>High levels of poverty among people in reentry as well as their families, making public benefits programs an essential safety net.Many people have health needs, disabilities, and other special needs that are met through public benefits programs.Most benefits in California do not restrict people based on criminal records, yet myths about eligibility persist.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Some public benefits programs have restrictions &amp; bans against people with certain convictions (but most do not).There may be disqualifications for other records, such as: <em>Open felony warrants (some programs have </em><strong><em>“fleeing felon”</em></strong><em> bans)</em>; people with <strong><em>probation or parole violations</em></strong>; or people with a history of <strong><em>Intentional Program Violations</em></strong><em> </em>(these are non-criminal, but still affect eligibility for some programs).There are myths &amp; misinformation – Some people may not know the exact program rules, especially new rules that have removed old drug felon bans. Even county welfare agency workers may not apply the correct rules.<strong>CHAPTER 5: EMPLOYMENT – PG. 595KEY TOPICS:</strong>Job readiness, applications, and interviewing well - <em>Presenting your best self.</em>Hiring incentives for employers.People’s rights with respect to background checks, including the following topics:<em>Job seeker’s rights.When an employer can ask about criminal records, and how it depends on the type of employer.Private, commercial background checks vs. “in-house” background checks.Errors in background checks.</em>Discrimination based on criminal record - <em>Legal &amp; illegal forms of discrimination</em> and <em>how to file a complaint.</em>Legal restrictions in employment &amp; professional licensing.Alternatives to traditional employment, including starting a business, worker-owned cooperatives, and more.The rights of people with disabilities to ask for reasonable accommodations from employers.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>Having or seeking employment is often a requirement of someone’s supervision conditions.Employment is critical for many as a source of income – which impacts <em>someone’s ability to afford housing, pay childcare, child support, or other court-ordered debt, go back to school, etc.</em>Self-efficacy, and contributing to society.Creates a structure of stability &amp; routine.In some cases, stable employment might be required to reconnect with children in reentry.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Background checks:Criminal history info is readily available from many sources.There are commonly errors &amp; illegally reported information in them.Illegal use of criminal history information.Statutory employment &amp; licensing restrictions:Job-specific prohibitions that may prevent people with records from holding some jobs.Professional/occupational licensing rules, regulations, &amp; restrictions that may prevent people with records from getting certain professional/occupational licenses, or will require them to go through a lengthy appeals process to successfully get a license.Discrimination based on criminal record:People with criminal records experience both legal and illegal discrimination in employment, and often overlaps with other issues like racial discrimination in employment decisions.There is individual discrimination and discriminatory policies to be aware of.Intentional discrimination by employers – may be hidden, difficult to prove.Unintentional violations by employers - employers may be unaware of laws forbidding certain types of discrimination on the basis of someone’s criminal record.<strong>CHAPTER 6: COURT-ORDERED DEBT – PG. 717KEY TOPICS:</strong>Understanding the different types of court-ordered debt, and what they are for, including: <em>Restitution;</em> <em>Court fines &amp; penalties; Administrative fees</em>; and <em>Traffic fines.</em>Taking control of court-ordered debt - <em>Figuring out how much debt is owed &amp; to whom.</em>Paying off or otherwise satisfying court-ordered debt, including:<em>How to pay off a debt &amp; what to do if a person can’t pay.Opportunities to reduce debt.Consequences of unpaid debts.</em><strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>People often leave prison and jail owing significant money in court-ordered debt.Debts can be owed in many different places:<em>Courts, collection agencies, victim restitution board, etc.It can be difficult to track down multiple and old debts.</em>Debts may increase during incarceration through <em>interest, administrative fees, and late-payment penalties.</em>Court-ordered debt created financial, legal, and practical barriers to reentry.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>There are multiple types/sources of debt, and people may owe multiple debts for a single conviction – this adds up FAST!During incarceration, debts may continue to increase.After release:Paying off court-ordered debt is a common condition (rule) of parole/probation.Probation can be extended for unpaid debt!Harder to clean up criminal record (expungement) if someone has unpaid criminal justice debt.Driver license may be suspended for unpaid court-ordered debts.Debts may be sent to collections agencies, which can lead to wage garnishment, bank &amp; property liens, a lower credit score; they also have a negative impact on housing, employment, credit opportunities, etc.Tracking down old fines &amp; tickets can be difficult.<strong>CHAPTER 7: FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN – PG. 784KEY TOPICS:</strong>Re-connecting with a child after incarceration, including:First steps to take in reconnecting, and locating a child.Finding out if there are any current or past court cases involving the child(ren), or court orders, and how to start or join a court case regarding children.Restraining &amp; protective orders that can impact a parent or caregiver’s rights.Criminal record-related barriers to reconnecting with a child.An overview of custody &amp; visitation.The three key courts that handle family-related issues in California, including: Probate Court (handles guardianships with no Child Protective Services or “CPS” involvement); Juvenile Dependency Court (cases where CPS is involved); and Family Court. (We also have an overview of juvenile delinquency courts, though the juvenile justice system is not a focus of this guide).Paternity issues.Child Support and Spousal Support – Issues with paying debts during and after incarceration.Issues that arise during incarceration, like mothering and pregnancy in prison, and ending a marriage or domestic partnership.Domestic violence and stay-away orders.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>Incarceration creates wide-ranging obstacles to stable family relationships – especially regarding custody, visitation, and guardianship of children.Family is a positive and motivating force in people’s lives during &amp; after incarceration and can reduce the chance of being re-incarcerated.Issues that arise in family courts—especially regarding visitation, custody, &amp; child support—can create more barriers in the reentry process, for example: housing restrictions, debt that builds up, etc.People need to know about the resources that do exist, since there are not many legal aid offices that provide family law representation to people with records.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>Parents’/caregivers’ rights to custody &amp; visitation may be legally restricted due to having a criminal record and/or system involvement:The impact of arrests, convictions, incarceration, protective &amp; restraining orders, etc.Courts have full access to expunged &amp; old criminal history information, and can consider it along with proof of rehabilitation.There are three different court systems to navigate - Probate (guardianship) court; Family court; and Juvenile Dependency court—and some cases may go from one to the other, or open or close without a parent fully understanding the legal process.Other barriers to reunification include: parole/probation conditions; travel &amp; residency restrictions; protective &amp; restraining orders; access to housing &amp; employment; time constraints; etc.Child support debt - Payment obligations do NOT automatically stop during incarceration in most cases—usually people need to proactively ask the court to stop or pause the payments!Very few family law services for reentering parents/caregivers.<strong>CHAPTER 8: EDUCATION – PG. 922KEY TOPICS:</strong>Setting Educational Goals, including:Choosing an educational path.Prison-based programs.Parole / probation considerations.Current vs. future educational and careers goals.Assessment of one’s current education level, placement tests, and assessing learning challenges, disabilities, &amp; special needs.Educational Options including: Adult Basic Education; High School Diploma / GED; career &amp; technical training; college &amp; university degrees; college credit programs while incarcerated (distance learning, correspondence courses); graduate &amp; professional degrees.Paying for an Education - Loans, grants, scholarships, other financial aid, including any record-related bans.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>Investing in education during reentry can help people avoid re-incarceration:Several studies have suggested that educational &amp; vocational training can help prevent people in reentry from going back to prison.Many jobs &amp; job markets now require employees to have some level of higher education:Educational qualifications vary from job to job.Some jobs require special licenses or certifications.In general, the more education a person has, the better chances he or she has of getting hired &amp; moving up the job ladder, and the higher his or her pay may be.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>Application / Admission Process:Background Checks.Discrimination Based on Criminal Record.Employment &amp; Professional Licensing Limitations.Financial Aid:Felony drug offense restrictions are rare, but are not well understood.Selective Service registration requirement (adult men).Conditions of Supervision:Travel limitations and residency restrictions can affect going to certain schools.Curfews, work requirements, &amp; other scheduling conflicts after school schedule.<strong>CHAPTER 9: UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD – PG. 1029KEY TOPICS:</strong>Types of criminal records &amp; what information they contain—and understanding the difference between RAP sheets, different types of background checks, and other public records.Errors in criminal records &amp; how to fix them.Who can see the different types of criminal records.How to get copies of criminal records.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>Cleaning up a criminal record can create more opportunities in reentry, especially related to limit what convictions show up in a background check, which can open up new employment and housing opportunities, and in some cases, restore certain civil rights.A way for someone to know what is on his or her criminal record and to take control over how it can impact life.This is the government’s way of providing official recognition of someone’s efforts at rehabilitation.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>A criminal record is a long-term barrier to reintegration and access of civil rights.There are commonly errors, incomplete information, &amp; illegal information reported in background checks.There are many different sources of criminal history information, and some are always going to be public thorugh the courts.Many people can see criminal history information, including:Private employers &amp; landlords can see convictions from past 7 years, and in rare cases, special employers can see more than that.Public (government) employers &amp; Public Housing Authorities can see much more!<strong> </strong></p><p class="appendixtocheading"><a id="Intro_Checklist"></a>“REENTRY-READY CHECKLIST” FOR CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE</p><p>This checklist is intended as an <strong>additional tool</strong> to be used <em>with the Roadmap to Reentry</em> Guide.

Every person’s circumstances and needs are different, so use this checklist in <strong>whichever way is best for you</strong>. If you are NOT currently incarcerated, but have a criminal record, parts of the checklist may still be a helpful tool!</p><p>* PLEASE NOTE: This checklist has been ordered to fit the timeline of reentry preparation from the perspectice of someone who is currently incarcerated, so it does not follow the exact order of the Guide.</p><p><strong>The Building Blocks of Reentry: <em>Obtaining Identification (ID) and Key Documents, Voting &amp; Civic Participation </em>(CHAPTER 1):</strong></p><ul><li>CAL-ID Program (“state prisons” only): Am I eligible?

The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p><p class="chaptertoc">ID &amp; VOTING: TABLE OF CONTENTS</p><p class="toc1">I.<strong>	</strong>INTRODUCTION	27</p><p class="toc4">What is identification (ID) and why is it important?	27Why do I need identification (ID)?	27I have a prison or jail ID.

Government agencies, workplaces, service providers, schools, and other institutions issue ID cards for people who are members. Many forms of ID include a photo and important information about you, such as your address or physical characteristics. Having an ID is important because, when you sign up for various programs, licenses, and services, you’ll have to show an ID to prove that you are who you say you are, and to show that you qualify for whatever you’re signing up for. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448152650"></a>Why do I need identification (ID)?</h3><p class="text">You need specific forms of ID to apply for many important resources and services, including housing, employment, education, medical care, public benefits, transportation, driving privileges, voting, banking, and licenses that allow you to work in certain types of jobs.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152651"></a>I have a prison or jail ID. Isn’t that enough to identify myself?</h3><p class="text">You may already have a prison or jail ID card, but these generally are not enough to help you prove who you are in all the areas you will need an official ID. At the start of your reentry, though, a prison or jail ID card may help you get other forms of ID. </p><a id="_Toc448152652"></a><h3>What are the most important forms of ID for me to have? </h3><h4 class="sidebox">NATURALIZED U.S. CITIZEN?</h4><p class="sidebox">If you were born outside of the U.S. and then became a citizen, instead of a getting a birth certificate, you need your naturalization certificate, for more details, go to PG. 39.</p><p class="text">As you rebuild your life in the community, there are 3 KEY DOCUMENTS for you to have: (1) your birth certificate; (2) your Social Security Card (or Number); and (3) a State ID or Driver License (don't need both, just one). The most important forms of ID for you to have first are your birth certificate and Social Security Number (SSN). Once you have these, you will be able to get a State ID card or a Driver License, the most commonly used forms of ID for everyday purposes. Once in a while, you will need to show a copy of your Social Security Card for certain services, but most of the time if you just know your Social Security Number (SSN), that’s enough.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152653"></a>I don’t have any ID right now. Where would be the best place to start &amp; when is the best time?</h3><h5 class="question">Where would be the best place to start? </h5><p class="answer">If you don’t have any of the 3 KEY ID DOCUMENTS—your Birth Certificate, a Social Security Card (or Number), a State ID or Driver License—you will have trouble proving your identity.If you do not have ANY of the 3 documents, it’s likely best to <em>get your birth certificate first, then your Social Security Card, and lastly your CA State ID or Driver License</em>. To learn more about these 3 key documents:</p><ol class="text">See PG. 31 for Birth CertificateSee PG. 40 for Social Security Card/ SSNSee PG. 46 for Driver License and State ID</ol><h5 class="question">When could I start, and can I start if I am currently incarcerated? </h5><p class="answer">It’s never too early to start trying to get a form of official ID. It helps to begin while you are still incarcerated as part of your preparation for release. If you are in a California state prison, a new state law requires the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to ensure that all eligible individuals have a California State ID upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This new law expands the “CAL-ID Program,” which is already available at California prison facilities called “reentry hubs,” to ALL California state prisons, requiring that the prison give you a California State ID <em>FOR FREE</em> at the time of release, if you are eligible. See PG. 47 for more information on this new program and what makes you eligible.If you’re already out, you have probably realized very quickly how important ID documents are in everyday life and it’s best to begin the process right away. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448152654"></a>I have used different names (“aliases”). What name is best to use on my ID documents?</h3><p class="text">Your ID documents must be in your “legal” name. This will be <em>the name that appears on your birth certificate</em>, unless you have <em>legally</em> changed it. Changes in your legal name are done through marriage or by court order.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Using a false name or presenting false documents to get ID is a FEDERAL offense. Don’t do it. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448152655"></a>Can I legally change my name?</h3><p class="text">Maybe. The California Courts website gives step-by-step instructions for changing your name online at the following website: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-namechange.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-namechange.htm</a>, which has specific information for people who are divorcing, getting married, changing their legal gender, and other requests.<strong> </strong>A judge must approve legal name changes. In all cases, you will need to prove that your name change doesn’t pose any security risk to the community.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> A judge may find that you <em>cannot</em> legally change your name if:</p><ol class="text">The judge finds that you are changing your name to commit fraud; ORThe judge finds that you are changing your name to hide from the police or law enforcement or for some other illegal reason; ORYou are currently on probation or parole—UNLESS your probation or parole officer is aware of your legal name change AND gives you written approval; ORIf you are incarcerated in prison.If you are incarcerated in a California state prison, the <em>Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)</em> MUST give the judge permission to let you change your name. If you are incarcerated in federal prison, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must give you permission to get your name legally changed.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[5]</a></sup></sup></ol><h3><a id="_Toc448152656"></a>I am an undocumented person. Can I get an official form of ID if I am undocumented?</h3><p class="text">No, but you may be able to get a special type of Driver License (called an “AB 60” License) approved for undocumented people to drive legally in California, and California only.An AB 60 “Undocumented Person” Driver License will NOT serve as official identification (meaning it does not establish eligibility for employment, voter registration, or public benefits), but it WILL ALLOW YOU to drive a car legally in the state of California.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> It’s against state law for state police to discriminate against anyone driving with an AB 60 License in California, but <em>federal agents and law enforcement agencies outside of California</em> are NOT required to honor your AB 60 Driver License. Depending on local laws and policies, you could face criminal or immigration consequences if you show your AB 60 “Undocumented” CA Driver License to a police officer in another state—so use it <em>only in California</em>! And do NOT try to use it in federal facilities, such as passing airport screenings or crossing through Customs and Border Patrols!<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Airports and Customs are federal, and they do NOT honor AB 60 license, and could use this against you.For more information on what it means to be an undocumented person in the U.S., you can contact a referral and information hotline such as 1-888-6-CHIRLA (1-888-624-4752), provided in English and Spanish by the <em>Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles</em>.

A certified copy of your birth certificate or naturalization certificate is necessary to get all other forms of ID. See PG. 31 (birth certificate) or PG. 39 (naturalization certificate).<strong>Stick to using your legal name as it appears on your birth certificate.</strong> Even if you have used other names in the past, stick with your legal name. It is your only legal identity.<strong>Keep photocopies of all your important forms as you go.Before you pay a fee for anything, find out if you can get a “reduced fee” or a “fee waiver” based on your income.</strong> Many forms of ID require that you pay a fee before they are issued. Some fees must be paid by everyone, while other fees can be reduced or excused (“waived”) for people with limited income. We have included some information about reduced fees on PG. 51, but always check for yourself.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> </ul><p class="widetableintroitalcaps">This chart summarizes how &amp; why each ID is important, AND THE approximate COST of EACH type.</p><table><tr><td colspan="3"><p class="tableheadingmedium">SUMMARY OF KEY DOCUMENTS</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="tablestyle2"><strong>KEY ID DOCUMENT</strong></p></td><td><p class="tablestyle2"><strong>COST</strong></p></td><td><p class="tablestyle2"><strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AUTHORIZED U.S. BIRTH CERTIFICATE</p></td><td><p><strong>ABOUT $25, BUT VARIES BY COUNTY.</strong></p></td><td><p>This proves your age and legal presence in the United States.

In most counties, if you request the document in person at the Recorder’s Office, this is the best option because the clerk can tell you almost immediately whether or not there is a record of your birth on file, and you can ask the clerk questions if there is trouble locating the correct record. Also, you might even be able to get the <em>certified copy</em> that same day. However, this may not be the right option for you if you are unable to travel to your birth county because of parole or other travel restrictions.</p><p><strong>REQUESTS TO RECORDER’S OFFICE BY MAIL: </strong></p><p class="text">After you have located the Recorder’s Office in the county where you were born, you will need to get a copy of that county’s specific application form.

Once you have the form, the process for requesting your birth certificate by mail is the same as the process for requesting it by mail from the CDPH (see those instructions on PG. 34).

Don’t worry if you do not have a valid form of ID—there is usually a way around this! Every office will have different policies and requirements, so make sure you call ahead and ask so that you can be prepared for how they will allow you to identify yourself. Below are some alternatives to presenting a photo ID:</p><ol class="text">In some counties, such as Alameda County, you simply have to sign the application under penalty of perjury in front of the clerk-recorder.

The government uses it primarily to identify you, but also to track your income for tax purposes and to calculate any Social Security benefits you accrue as you work. Also, other institutions—like banks, hospitals, schools, and businesses—will use your SSN as a way to identify you.<sup><a href="#footnote-39" id="footnote-ref-39">[39]</a></sup> A <strong><em>Social Security Card</em></strong> is a paper card that provides a record of your name and SSN.

You can apply for a replacement card by mail or in person at a local SSA Field Office.

You will have to wait until you get out.However, if you were given a SSN at some point in the past, the SSA may issue you a replacement card with your original number on it while you are still incarcerated—under limited circumstances.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-44" id="footnote-ref-44">[44]</a></sup></sup> See the next question (PG. 41) for the procedures of getting a replacement card while incarcerated.</p><h3><a id="Replacement_SSC_While_Incarcerated"></a><a id="_Toc448152689"></a>How do I get a replacement card while I am incarcerated?</h3><p class="text">The process for requesting a replacement card while you are still incarcerated is fairly straightforward. However, due to conflicting rules and practices within the Social Security Administration (SSA), it’s hard to say whether you will be successful or not. You should try anyway. <em>Here is what may affect your request:</em></p><ol class="text"><strong><em>The facility you are in: </em>Where you are incarcerated may affect your ability to get an SSC while you are still incarcerated.</strong><a id="MOUs_SSA"></a><strong><em>MOUs:</em></strong> Official policy states that before the SSA will accept “certification” (proof) of your identity from a correctional facility in order to get your SSN, that correctional facility must enter into a special formal agreement with the SSA called a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The purpose of the MOU is to ensure that the corrections officials follow the same strict procedures and requirements as the SSA officials do when they verify people’s identities. If your facility has an MOU with the SSA, the SSA will accept the facility’s certification that you are who you say you are as proof of your identity. However, not all state corrections agencies or facilities have MOU agreements with the SSA. If your facility does not have a current, valid, signed MOU with the SSA, the SSA field office reviewer that evaluates your application cannot accept a certification from the facility as a 100% proof of your identity. If your facility does not have an MOU with the SSA, then its certification carries less weight, and your application for a replacement Social Security Card is more likely to get denied.<strong><em>Your local Field Office/Reviewer:</em> The practices of your local Field Office in reviewing applications from incarcerated people will affect your ability to get a Social Security Card while you are incarcerated.</strong>If your facility does <em>not</em> have an MOU with the SSA, the local Field Office should still evaluate your application as it would any other application.<sup><a href="#footnote-45" id="footnote-ref-45">[45]</a></sup> This means that your reviewer can <em>consider</em> the certification, but can’t <em>rely</em> on it 100%. How much weight your reviewer gives to the certification will depend on that field office’s practices. Some field offices accept certifications without hassle; others do not. It’s always worth a try!</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448152690"></a>How do I find out if my correctional facility has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement with the Social Security Administration (ssa)?</h3><p class="text">Unfortunately, this information is not readily available.

The Regional Office that serves California is:SSA Regional Public Affairs OfficeP.O.

Unfortunately, the SSA writes these rules for the general public—for people who still have valid and current primary ID documents and can easily replace their Social Security Card. Even if you do not have primary ID documents, you may still be able to get a replacement Social Security Card. Gather as much identifying information and documentation as you can to include with your application. Then, on a case-by-case basis, the SSA gets to decide whether or not you have sufficiently proven who you are.<em>IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY ID DOCUMENT, USE AS MANY OF THE FOLLOWING AS YOU HAVE:</em></p><ul class="importantbox">Authorized Birth Certificate—Without a primary ID document, your birth certificate will be the most important document you submit.

CDCR has also informed us that a Parole Services Associate (PSA) collects the CAL-ID applications, sends them to CDCR headquarters, and monitors each prisoner’s progress in the CAL-ID program using an electronic tracking log.As your release date approaches, you should be meeting with your counselor to develop a reentry plan. If you’re eligible for the CAL-ID program, your counselor should help you fill out the application for a CA State ID. If your counselor has not mentioned the program, and you think you are eligible, you should bring it to your counselor’s attention. The prison staff will check that all of your information is accurate, and then send your application to the CAL-ID Coordinator’s office at CDCR, which then shares it with the DMV.If the DMV finds that you are eligible, it will send your new CA State ID directly to the prison. The prison will hold the ID in your file and give it to you at the time you are released. NOTE: It’s possible your CA State ID card won’t arrive in time before your release—for example, if your release date is recalculated so that you get out earlier than expected. In this case, once your CA State ID card is ready, the prison will send it to your address in the community, or (if you’re on parole) send it to your parole officer to give it to you.</p><h4 class="sidebox">OPTIONAL STEPS TO SAVE YOU TIME!</h4><p class="sidebox">(1) Schedule an appointment.

If you do not know in which state the suspension/revocation happened, you can call the National Driver Register to find out where the problem occurred (see more information immediately below).</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152717"></a>What laws could negatively affect me if I am trying to get (or keep) a California driver license?</h3><p class="text">A few different laws, explained below, may affect your ability to get or keep a CA Driver License:</p><h4>National Driver Register (NDR)<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-171" id="footnote-ref-171">[171]</a></sup></em></strong></h4><p class="text">When you apply for a California Driver License, the California DMV will check to see whether your name is listed in the NDR’s Problem Driver Pointer System.<sup><a href="#footnote-172" id="footnote-ref-172">[172]</a></sup> The NDR database contains information about all drivers who have had their licenses denied, revoked or suspended, or who have been convicted of serious traffic violations such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.<sup><a href="#footnote-173" id="footnote-ref-173">[173]</a></sup> The NDR has information on drivers from <em>all 50 states</em>.If your name appears in the NDR database, the DMV will investigate the reason and decide whether or not to issue you a CA Driver License. If your license was suspended or revoked in another state, the DMV will not issue you a CA Driver License until you fulfill the conditions of suspension or revocation in the other state (including paying all fines and reinstatement fees).<sup><a href="#footnote-174" id="footnote-ref-174">[174]</a></sup></p><h5 class="question">How do I find out if my name is in the NDR database?</h5><p class="answer">You can find out if your name is in the NDR database and check your driver status <em>for free</em> by sending a request letter to the NDR.<sup><a href="#footnote-175" id="footnote-ref-175">[175]</a></sup> Although the database does not contain your detailed driving record (i.e., it will not tell you <em>why</em> your license was suspended), it will tell you the status of your driver license and the state where any problem occurred (called the State-of-Record, or SOR).<sup><a href="#footnote-176" id="footnote-ref-176">[176]</a></sup> If you already know the state in which your offense occurred, it may be faster and easier to contact that state’s DMV agency directly for information.To check your NDR status, write and send a notarized letter (also called a “privacy act request”) to the NDR, stating that you would like an NDR file check. Make sure to include your full legal name, date of birth, gender, height, weight, eye color, and your previous driver license number and state (if you know them); your social security number is optional.<sup><a href="#footnote-177" id="footnote-ref-177">[177]</a></sup> If your name is in the NDR database, it may mean that your driver license has been suspended, cancelled, revoked, or denied because of a serious traffic violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-178" id="footnote-ref-178">[178]</a></sup></p><h5 class="question">What can I do if my name is in the NDR database?</h5><p class="answer">Once you know your driver license status and which state the problem occurred in, you must contact that state’s DMV agency directly to find out how to resolve the issue and reinstate your license.<sup><a href="#footnote-179" id="footnote-ref-179">[179]</a></sup> You may need to request a copy of your driving record from that state, in order to learn why your license was suspended or revoked.<sup><a href="#footnote-180" id="footnote-ref-180">[180]</a></sup>If you think the NDR database is incorrect, you will still need to contact the state DMV agency where the problem supposedly occurred. You will need to resolve the error directly with agency before the NDR can correct or delete your record.<sup><a href="#footnote-181" id="footnote-ref-181">[181]</a></sup></p><h4>Driver License Compact (DLC)</h4><p class="text">The DLC is an agreement between California and most other states in the U.S. to share driver records and information about traffic violations.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-182" id="footnote-ref-182">[182]</a></sup></sup> When you apply for a California Driver License, the California DMV will check to see if you ever had a Driver License in another state.<sup><a href="#footnote-183" id="footnote-ref-183">[183]</a></sup> If your license from another state was <em>suspended</em>, the DMV will not issue a new license until the suspension period is over.<sup><a href="#footnote-184" id="footnote-ref-184">[184]</a></sup> If your license from another state was <em>revoked</em>, the DMV will not issue a new license until the revocation period is over or 1 year has passed since the revocation (whichever comes first).<sup><a href="#footnote-185" id="footnote-ref-185">[185]</a></sup> In addition, the DLC requires each state to enforce traffic convictions that happened in another state—including by suspending or revoking your license for serious violations. For example, if you have a California Driver License, but you were convicted of a DUI in another state, the state where your DUI occurred will report the conviction to the California DMV. The California DMV will then penalize you for the violation—including suspending or revoking your California Driver License—just as if the violation had occurred locally.<sup><a href="#footnote-186" id="footnote-ref-186">[186]</a></sup> The conviction will also appear on your California driving record.<sup><a href="#footnote-187" id="footnote-ref-187">[187]</a></sup> If you want to appeal your license suspension for an out-of-state traffic conviction, you will have to follow California’s appeal procedures.<sup><a href="#footnote-188" id="footnote-ref-188">[188]</a></sup> In general, you will have to show that the other state’s DUI conviction is not the same as California’s DUI laws, or that the conviction was invalid for some other reason.<sup><a href="#footnote-189" id="footnote-ref-189">[189]</a></sup></p><h4>Nonresident Violator Compact (NRVC)<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-190" id="footnote-ref-190">[190]</a></sup></em></strong> (not yet in CA)</h4><p class="text">The NRVC is another agreement among most U.S. states to enforce out-of-state traffic violations. If you get an out-of-state ticket and then fail to pay the fine or appear in court, the state where you got the ticket will notify your home state (where your Driver License is from) that you didn’t comply with the ticket. Your home state can then suspend your license for failing to comply with the out-of-state ticket.Currently, California is <em>not</em> part of the NRVC, so failing to comply with an out-of-state ticket may not affect your California Driver License.<sup><a href="#footnote-191" id="footnote-ref-191">[191]</a></sup> (However, the California DMV can still penalize you for the traffic violation itself, just not for your failure to comply with it.) On the other hand, if your Driver License is from another state, but you receive a ticket in California, you may have to pay the traffic fine or post bail immediately (or be subject to arrest if you cannot pay right away), and/or you may lose the right to drive in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-192" id="footnote-ref-192">[192]</a></sup>If your right to drive in California has been suspended or revoked, but your Driver License is from another state, you can use Form DL 300, “California Proof Requirements for Non-Residents,” to prove your ability to pay and/or car insurance (called “financial responsibility”) and request that your California driving privileges be restored. The form is available online at <a href="http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/forms/dl/dl300.pdf">http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/forms/dl/dl300.pdf</a>.</p><h4>Driver License Agreement<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-193" id="footnote-ref-193">[193]</a></sup></em></strong> (not yet in CA)</h4><p class="text">The Driver License Agreement combines the DLC and NRVC into a single agreement, and increases enforcement of out-of-state traffic violations, making the rules stricter and more severe.<sup><a href="#footnote-194" id="footnote-ref-194">[194]</a></sup> However, this agreement is still very new and doesn’t apply in most states (including California).<sup><a href="#footnote-195" id="footnote-ref-195">[195]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448152718"></a>Does getting my criminal conviction expunged help me get my suspended or revoked driver license back?</h3><p class="text">No. Unfortunately, an “expungement” (a California dismissal) won’t get your CA Driver License back if the DMV suspended or revoked it.<sup><a href="#footnote-196" id="footnote-ref-196">[196]</a></sup> The only way to get your Driver License back is to satisfy the requirements of the DMV.</p><p class="tableheadingmedium"><a id="ID_UndocumentedAndNeedIDBox"></a><em>I AM UNDOCUMENTED &amp; NEED ID!</em></p><h3><a id="_Toc448152719"></a>What type of ID can I get if I am undocumented?</h3><p class="textbox">You may be able to get one of these limited forms of ID, which can be used for some but not all purposes:<strong>Consular Identification Cards (CIDs):</strong> Some governments issue CID cards to identify their citizens who are living in foreign countries. CID cards can be issued to people who are undocumented or documented in the foreign county. See Appendix H, PG. 115, for a list of countries that issue CIDs. If you are a citizen of one of these countries, visit the nearest consulate to obtain your CID card. In the U.S., CID cards can be a helpful ID document as you try to get a Driver License, open a bank account, show proof of identity to police, and access other services. However, CIDs do not grant you legal presence in the U.S. or other privileges.<sup><a href="#footnote-197" id="footnote-ref-197">[197]</a></sup> <strong>Municipal IDs:</strong> A handful of California cities have begun issuing municipal (“city”) ID cards for their residents. You can use these to get access to city services and benefits. More importantly, they are considered a form of identification by local officials and may provide evidence to get other forms of ID.

Voting can also be a meaningful way to <em>exercise your rights</em> as a citizen, and an opportunity to <em>express your political identity</em> as a member of your city, county, state, and/or country.<em>As a person with a criminal record, you may or may not have lost your right to vote.</em> If you’re still able to vote, you may be deciding whether to exercise your right. If you’ve lost your right to vote and need to restore it, you may be deciding whether it’s worth the effort. Either way, voting rights are extremely important in each citizen having a voice—and yet states have absolute power to restrict <em>or</em> restore the voting rights of people with criminal records.<sup><a href="#footnote-240" id="footnote-ref-240">[240]</a></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448152737"></a>Who can register to vote in California?</h3><p class="text">Generally speaking, to register to vote in the next election, you must be a U.S. citizen, a California resident, and at least age 18 by Election Day. <em>Bu</em>t even if you meet those requirements, you might not be able to register depending on your custody or supervision status.

Because your prison ID was issued by the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR), which is a government agency, it <em>should be </em>an acceptable form of ID. Keep in mind though that the people who work at the polling stations are volunteers and not experts in California law, so you may need to speak with a few different people if you are having difficulties.

The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide.

They are:<span class="emphasisheavy">STATE PAROLE: </span>In California, parole is a condition of release for most people coming out of prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-308" id="footnote-ref-308">[308]</a></sup> It only applies in felony cases when a person is sentenced to state prison. It also only takes effect after release from prison.People sentenced to serve <em>determinate sentences</em>—such as an exact term of “seven years”—serve the specified amount of time in prison ordered by the judge. Once their sentence is over, they are released.People sentenced to serve indeterminate terms, such as “25 to life with the possibility of parole,” are released only after a Board of Parole Hearing (BPH) determines that they are ready to re-enter society.<sup><a href="#footnote-309" id="footnote-ref-309">[309]</a></sup> Most people released from California state prison are required to serve a period of parole after they are released. People on parole—called parolees—remain under the control of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s (CDCR) Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), are supervised by CDCR parole agents, and must meet certain requirements or “conditions” of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-310" id="footnote-ref-310">[310]</a></sup><span class="emphasisheavy">COUNTY PROBATION &amp; NEW FORMS OF COUNTY-LEVEL SUPERVISION:</span> Probation is a type of supervision that a judge orders at trial as <em>part of the original sentence</em>, either as an alternative to incarceration OR in addition to incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-311" id="footnote-ref-311">[311]</a></sup> California probation reduces or eliminates the time that a person must spend in custody in jail or prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-312" id="footnote-ref-312">[312]</a></sup> People on probation must report to their county probation office (for formal probation, more information is on PG. 198) or to local superior court (for informal probation, more information is on PG. 193), and must meet certain requirements or “conditions” of probation. Depending on the circumstances, either the court or a probation officer monitors the person’s compliance with his/her probation terms. Informal Probation, Formal Probation, Mandatory Supervision, and Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) are all types of community supervision that fall under the responsibility of California’s county probation departments. Unlike state parole offices, which are all operated by CDCR and DAPO, county probation departments have a lot more independence and differences between them. Here is a quick overview of the different types of county probation:</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>INFORMAL PROBATION: Informal Probation is a type of supervision for some misdemeanor convictions in which you are supervised by the court, and not by a probation officer—also called summary probation or court probation. If you get probation imposed for a conviction that is a California misdemeanor, it is known as misdemeanor probation—also called “informal” probation or “summary” probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-313" id="footnote-ref-313">[313]</a></sup>FORMAL PROBATION: Formal Probation is a type of supervision for felony and some misdemeanor convictions in which you are supervised by a probation officer <sup><a href="#footnote-314" id="footnote-ref-314">[314]</a></sup>POST-RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION (PRCS): People released from a state prison after incarceration for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual crimes are placed under supervision by local, county probation officers instead of being supervised under state parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-315" id="footnote-ref-315">[315]</a></sup> This form of supervision is called Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS). PRCS can last for up to 3 years, but can end earlier if the person under supervision does not violate any conditions of his/her PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-316" id="footnote-ref-316">[316]</a></sup>MANDATORY SUPERVISION: Mandatory Supervision: In California, through a process called “split sentencing, a judge can split the time of a sentence between a jail term and a period of supervision by a county probation officer. This type of supervision is known as Mandatory Supervision.</strong></p><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">FEDERAL PROBATION</span>: People convicted of certain federal offenses may be sentenced to Federal Probation or Supervised Release. The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System oversees federal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-317" id="footnote-ref-317">[317]</a></sup></p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>FEDERAL PROBATION: After you are convicted of a federal crime, federal probation is used as an alternative sentence <em>to prison time</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-318" id="footnote-ref-318">[318]</a></sup></sup> That means that federal “probation” is still considered a sentence in and of itself.

We don’t agree with many of the ways that people with criminal records are described, but at times we use this language to make this material understandable to our readers.

State parole only takes effect after you are released from prison.</p><p>People on parole—sometimes called parolees—remain under the control of CDCR. Within CDCR, parolees are more specifically under the control of the Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), a division of CDCR. As a parolee, you are supervised by CDCR parole agents, and must satisfy certain rules or “conditions” of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-326" id="footnote-ref-326">[326]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448152783"></a>I am currently incarcerated in California state prison, and preparing for release. Will I be required to serve a parole term after I get released from prison?</h3><p class="text">Yes, if you committed a certain type of offense, or are in a specific situation. If you are currently incarcerated in California state prison, you must serve a parole term after release from prison if any of the following apply:</p><ol class="text">Your current prison term is for a <em>serious felony</em> as defined in Cal. Penal Code § 1192.7(c);Your current prison term is for a <em>violent felony</em> as defined in Cal. Penal Code § 667.5(c);You were sentenced as a <em>“three-striker”</em> under Cal.

Penal Code § 2962.2.</ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you don't fall into any of these categories, then you are likely on a new form of supervision called Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS). Go to PG. 201 to learn more about PRCS.

The agent’s name, address, and telephone number should be on CDCR Form 611, “<a id="PP_FirstDays_RPSinformation"></a><a id="PP_StateParole_FirstDays_RPSinformation"></a>Release Program Study” (RPS) (see example of RPS in Appendix S, PG. 316), which you should have received a copy of at least 45 days before your release date (or if less than 45 days remain because your legal status changed in prison, then as soon as possible before your release to parole).<sup><a href="#footnote-331" id="footnote-ref-331">[331]</a></sup> If you cannot get a hold of your parole agent, or do not know who that person is, try going to the closest parole office you can find and ask them for help. The parole office can call your parole agent and let him or her know you are coming and when you will be there. For a list of California state parole office’s main phone numbers, visit: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/</a>. If you were given a date, time, and place to report to your parole officer (see your Form 611, Release Program Study (RPS)), you should report to him or her at that time in that location.<sup><a href="#footnote-332" id="footnote-ref-332">[332]</a></sup> Generally, it is recommended that if you get out on a weekday and have the time or ability to go to the office that day, you should. If you get out on a weekend or national holiday when the parole office is closed, it is recommended that you go to your parole office the very next day it is open. If you get stuck out of town, get lost, or cannot get to where you have to go, call your parole agent or the Officer of the Day collect. Call the Parole Headquarters for your Region (or if you don’t know which region, call the California Region I Headquarters) and ask for the Officer of the Day: Northern Region Headquarters (Tel. 916-255-2758); Southern Region Parole Headquarters (Tel. 909-468-2300).<sup><a href="#footnote-333" id="footnote-ref-333">[333]</a></sup></p><h5 class="numberboldblack">TELL YOUR PAROLE AGENT OF CRIMES AGAINST YOU AFTER RELEASE, IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS.</h5><p class="text">If anyone commits a crime against you before you make contact with your parole officer, tell your parole agent what happened.<sup><a href="#footnote-334" id="footnote-ref-334">[334]</a></sup></p><h5 class="numberboldblack">TELL YOUR PAROLE AGENT IF YOU ARE STOPPED BY THE POLICE.</h5><p class="text">If you get stopped by the police for any reason, tell your parole agent about it.<sup><a href="#footnote-335" id="footnote-ref-335">[335]</a></sup></p><h5 class="numberboldblack">REGISTER WITH THE LOCAL POLICE OR SHERIFF, IF NECESSARY.</h5><p class="text">Before you get out of prison, you should be told if you have to register with the local police or sheriff.

You are entitled to the money in your trust account and gate money. You may be able to get other emergency funds by requesting them through your parole agent. Below we explain the types of financial assistance you can ask for on your first days out in more detail:</p><h5 class="numberboldblack">TRUST ACCOUNTS: </h5><h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “INTEREST”?</h4><p class="sidebox">Interest is a small percentage amount of your money being held that gets added to your account periodically for the prison having the ability to hold your money.</p><p class="text">Money that you brought to, earned, or received in prison is kept in an interest-bearing trust account. The “interest” is paid to the trust account on a monthly basis, minus operational expenses incurred. Any money in your prison trust account, including any interest you earned, must be given to you at your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-346" id="footnote-ref-346">[346]</a></sup></p><h4 class="sidebox">I WAS IN CDCR’s CUSTODY FOR LESS THAN 6 MONTHS DUE TO A PAROLE VIOLATION. DO I GET GATE MONEY WHEN I AM RELEASED?</h4><p class="sidebox">If you were returned to the custody of prison or jail on a parole violation—but were there for less than 6 months—you will receive $1.10 per day that you are held, up to a maximum of $200. (<em>See</em> 15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3075.2(d)(4).)</p><h5 class="numberboldblack"><a id="PP_StateParole_GateMoney"></a>GATE MONEY (a.k.a. “RELEASE ALLOWANCE”):</h5><h4>&gt; $200 GATE MONEY:</h4><p class="text">If you are leaving state prison and you are (1) paroled, (2) placed on post-release community supervision (PRCS), or (3) discharged from a CDCR institution or reentry facility, you are entitled to $200 in state funds upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-347" id="footnote-ref-347">[347]</a></sup> Even though your parole agent is responsible for giving you these funds, the agent is not required to give you the entire amount immediately. Instead, your parole agent may distribute the $200 in separate, smaller amounts over a period of 60 days following your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-348" id="footnote-ref-348">[348]</a></sup> By the end of those 60 days, you should have received the entire $200. If you need to purchase clothes or a bus ticket at the time of your release, you must pay for it; CDCR does not provide extra gate money for clothing or transportation, but will deduct it from your $200 gate money if you ask them to front this cost.<sup><a href="#footnote-349" id="footnote-ref-349">[349]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You also have the right to the $200 gate money in the following cases:</p><ul class="importantbox">If you were sent to a local jail for civil commitment proceedings or evaluation as a “sexually violent predator” (SVP).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-350" id="footnote-ref-350">[350]</a></sup></strong>If you are a “lifer parolee” who returned to prison on a parole violation, when you are re-released to parole.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-351" id="footnote-ref-351">[351]</a></sup></strong>If you served 6 straight months or more on a sentence OR on a return-to-custody for a parole violation (these 6 months could be time spent in jail or in prison).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-352" id="footnote-ref-352">[352]</a></sup></strong><em>If you do not receive your gate money in one of these situations—a common occurrence—you should file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal.

This means if you fail to report or to let your parole agent know of your whereabouts, you lose your right to the $200 gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-359" id="footnote-ref-359">[359]</a></sup> If you abscond from parole, you also risk: 1) getting your parole revoked and going back to prison; 2) being held on parole for a longer time period than originally required; 3) being forced to wear a GPS tracking advice by parole (see PG. 168). </p><h4>&gt; YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION</h4><p class="text">If you are released after being placed in jail for parole revocation proceedings, you do not receive gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-360" id="footnote-ref-360">[360]</a></sup></p><h5 class="question">What should I do if I don’t get my gate money?</h5><p class="text">Your parole officer should provide you your gate money at your release. If, however, your officer does not have the money or does not know where to send it, you should file an administrative appeal (CDCR Form 602 and CDCR Form 22) and start the grievance process. We recommend keeping copies and dates of any appeals or grievance forms you submit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-361" id="footnote-ref-361">[361]</a></sup></sup> If you are in special proceedings—like MDO (Mentally Disordered Offender) or SVP (Sexually Violent Predator) hearings—your public defender/defense attorney <em>may</em> be able to help you with this process, as getting the gate money is more complicated. To learn how to file an administrative appeal on a CDCR Form 602, see PG. 175.</p><h5 class="numberboldblack">EMERGENCY FUNDS </h5><p class="text">There are 2 very limited types of emergency funds<sup><a href="#footnote-362" id="footnote-ref-362">[362]</a></sup> that you can request through your parole agent: (1) Cash Assistance Loans (also called “financial assistance funds”)<sup><a href="#footnote-363" id="footnote-ref-363">[363]</a></sup> and (2) Funds for Services (also called “Bank Drafts”).<sup><a href="#footnote-364" id="footnote-ref-364">[364]</a></sup> Unfortunately, in these current tight budget times, these funds are extremely limited.These funds are <em>discretionary</em>. This means that your parole agent and his or her supervisor decide whether to give you a “cash assistance loan” or funds for services. Their decision will depend on the following factors:</p><h4 class="sidebox">WHAT STOPS THE CLOCK FOR MY LENGTH OF TIME ON PAROLE?</h4><p class="sidebox">The clock for your parole period is paused if:(1) YOU GO MISSING: Any time during that you “abscond” from parole (go missing or fail to report to your parole agent), and any time you are not available for parole supervision, this “stops the clock” and does not count toward the parole period. (2) YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR (SVP) PROCEEDINGS: The parole term is “tolled” (paused) until the SVP proceedings are dismissed or you are discharged from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH).(3) YOU ARE SENT TO COUNTY JAIL (NOT PRISON) FOR A NEW FELONY CONVICTION. If you are sentenced to a county jail term for a new felony conviction, you will stay on parole while serving your jail sentence, but the clock will pause on your parole term. If the jail sentence ends before your controlling discharge date (CDD) (see chart on PG. 154), you must report to your parole officer upon release and finish serving your original parole term. But if your are sentenced for a new felony conviction, your parole will just be forgotten about—it isn’t paused, but it no longer matters. </p><ol class="text">Whether there is money available;<sup><a href="#footnote-365" id="footnote-ref-365">[365]</a></sup>The circumstances, including your history and needs;<sup><a href="#footnote-366" id="footnote-ref-366">[366]</a></sup> ANDWhether you are a citizen (as there are legal limits on the financial assistance that CA State Parole can provide to certain parolees who are <em>not</em> U.S. citizens).<sup><a href="#footnote-367" id="footnote-ref-367">[367]</a></sup></ol><p><strong>(1) FIRST TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Cash Assistance Loans </strong></p><p>Cash Assistance Loans (a.k.a. “Financial Assistance Funds”) are loans that you may request from your parole agent.

The state law that is applied to determine your base parole period and maximum parole period is the law that was in existence <em>at the time of the commitment offense</em> (NOT the date you were sentenced on and NOT the date you were released onto parole).<sup><a href="#footnote-372" id="footnote-ref-372">[372]</a></sup>In most cases, there is a minimum parole period that can be increased up to a maximum parole period if you commit parole violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-373" id="footnote-ref-373">[373]</a></sup> Because state laws set the minimum &amp; maximum parole term lengths, the date that a person actually gets off parole will be determined by a number of factors. See PG. 154 for more information. There are actually 3 discharge dates—a Controlling Discharge Date, Maximum Discharge Date, and Presumptive Discharge Date— that together determine when you actually get off parole, and a number of factors that interact with those 3 dates to determine when you’re eligible to get off parole earlier or later than originally expected. See the chart on PG. 154 below for a detailed description of these three dates and how they interact with each other.You can find the parole term lengths in California Penal Code § 3000(b) (for set-length parole terms) and § 3000.1 (for life-long parole terms)—we have included copies of the current versions of these laws in Appendix F, PG. 281, for your reference.

Sometimes the formal response is sent to a parole agent, who doesn’t hand it over to the parolee. If you are not physically sent or handed a WRITTEN formal response to your Form 602 appeal (which is different and separate than the written response from your parole agent to a Form 22 request), then this is NOT considered an answer or formal response under law—because it was never given/sent to you. After 30 working days are up, you can try calling your parole agent to find out where the formal response to your 602 is and request a copy be sent to you immediately, but if you are still not given anything after an unreasonable amount of time has passed, then you have exhausted (completed) the administrative appeals process and can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus (or file a second 602 appeal about the delay). See PG. 155 for detailed information about what to do if you don’t hear back within the legal time limits. Please note: A short delay is unlikely to be seen as “exhausting” the administrative appeals process—for example, a few days or a week late, or a mistake that was immediately fixed by handing you a copy when you asked—but if a month or more has passed, this looks more like an unreasonable delay and is likely to be considered exhaustion, allowing you to take the case to state court.</p><h4 class="textbox">IMPORT<a id="responsetimelimit602"></a>ANT!

However, any items that are taken (seized) during the search may still be used as evidence against you in a later court proceeding or in a revocation hearing.

You should ask him/her to submit a Transfer Investigation Request form (TIR). The correctional counselor will submit your TIR to the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) (for lifers), which generally discusses it with the District Attorney responsible for your case, to make a final decision, OR to the Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), which makes decisions about transfer requests for non-lifers.<sup><a href="#footnote-517" id="footnote-ref-517">[517]</a></sup> Try to work with the correctional counselor as much as possible.</p><p>You should explain why being in a different county will help you be more successful living in the community. You should also provide supporting documents (such as letters from supportive family members, a doctor, a prospective employer) verifying the reasons that the transfer would be beneficial to your rehabilitation and reentry, and submit these supporting documents along with the correctional counselor’s Transfer Investigation Request (TIR) to the BPH.<sup><a href="#footnote-518" id="footnote-ref-518">[518]</a></sup> </p><p>The BPH could deny your request to transfer your parole to another county if: </p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>It believes denying your request will better protect the safety of the victi</strong><a id="victimparoletransfer"></a><strong>m; It believes denying your request will better protect the public’s safety;You don’t have verified work or educational program in your requested county; You don’t have family/ a support stem in your requested county<sup><a href="#footnote-519" id="footnote-ref-519">[519]</a></sup></strong></p><h4>HOW TO REQUEST after you are released:</h4><p>You should submit a verbal or written request to your parole agent. It’s recommended that you submit a written request, and make a copy and keep it in a safe place—just in case you don’t hear back and need to follow up with documentation. There is no special form that you need to use; your request can be submitted as a standard dated letter. <em>See the next question to learn about how your request should be processed by parole after it is received.</em></p><p>You should explain to your parole officer why being in a different county will help you be more successful living in the community.

Each county is responsible for running its own probation department, and each of these departments has its own specific rules. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448152858"></a>How did California’s “Realignment law” change California’s probation System?</h3><p>The Realignment Law (“A.B. 109”) fundamentally changed <em>sentencing law</em> and created new forms of community supervision in California. Because of prison overcrowding, the Supreme Court ordered California to lower the number of people it was holding in its state prisons. In order to do this, California decided to keep only people convicted of certain serious felonies in prison. It transferred the responsibility of people convicted of felonies that are considered non-serious and non-violent from the state prisons and parole board to the county jails and probation departments. This means that: </p><ol class="text">If you are convicted after October 1, 2011, of a felony that falls within the Realignment definition of non-serious, non-violent, and non-sexual (the 3 “nons” or “non-non-non”), you will serve your time in county jail instead of state prison. (You also must not have any prior serious, violent or sexual felony convictions.) Under Realignment, there is also the possibility that you might be allowed to serve some of your sentence on community supervision, instead of spending the full term in custody.If you were convicted of a “non-non-non” with no priors before October 11, 2011, and you are serving your sentence in prison, you will be put on county-level supervision (PRCS) instead of state parole when you are released.</ol><p class="text">Here are the 4 types of community supervision after Realignment: (1) <strong>informal probation</strong> (also known as “summary” or “court” probation); (2) <strong>formal probation</strong>; (3) <strong>Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) </strong>(new after Realignment) and (4) <strong>Mandatory Supervision</strong> (new after Realignment).</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152859"></a>What types of supervision now fall under the control of county probation after realignment?</h3><p><strong>Here is a quick overview of the different types of supervision that are now under the control of county probation departments in California after Realignment:</strong></p><ol class="text"><strong>Informal Probation</strong> (also known as summary or court probation): Informal probation is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by the court, and not by a probation officer. A judge may order informal probation for misdemeanor convictions, but not for felony convictions at the time you’re sentenced; however, if you receive formal probation for a felony conviction, your supervision level may be later reduced to informal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-600" id="footnote-ref-600">[600]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 193. <strong>Formal Probation</strong>: Formal probation is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by a probation officer. It’s the minimum supervision that a judge can order for a felony conviction, and it can also be given out for some more serious misdemeanor convictions and people who have prior convictions.<sup><a href="#footnote-601" id="footnote-ref-601">[601]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 198.<br /><em>(Note: Depending on the type of felony, you may not be on probation, but rather on state parole, which is covered separately, beginning on PG. 146.)</em> <strong>Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS)</strong>: PRCS is a new type of supervision created by Realignment. Now, people who are released from state prison after serving a sentence for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual crime will be supervised by local county probation officers instead of state parole officers. PRCS can last for up to 3 years, but will end after 1 year if you do not violate any of your PRCS conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-602" id="footnote-ref-602">[602]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 201.<strong>Mandatory Supervision:</strong> Mandatory supervision is also a new type of supervision created by Realignment. If you were convicted of a “non-non-non” felony, California state courts are allowed now to use a tool called “split sentencing,” which allows a judge to split the time of a sentence between time in jail and a period of supervision by a county probation officer. This period of supervision after the jail term is called Mandatory Supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-603" id="footnote-ref-603">[603]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 207.</ol><h1 class="subheading"><a id="PP_Informal_Prob"></a><a id="_Toc448152860"></a>Informal Probation (also known as Summary Probation or court probation)</h1><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152861"></a>Basics of Informal Probation</h2><h3><a id="msdprobationinfo"></a><a id="_Toc448152862"></a>What is Informal probation (also known as summary probation or court probation)?</h3><p>Informal probation (also known as “summary probation” or “court probation”) is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by the court, and not by a probation officer.

California’s 2011 Realignment law (AB 109) has given criminal courts in California a legal tool called “split sentencing.”<sup><a href="#footnote-684" id="footnote-ref-684">[684]</a></sup> Split sentencing allows a judge to split the time of a person’s sentence between a jail term and a period of supervision by a probation officer. While Mandatory Supervision is <em>not technically</em> probation under law, it will feel the same—you will be supervised by a county probation officer, and it will feel a lot like probation in how the supervision functions.<sup><a href="#footnote-685" id="footnote-ref-685">[685]</a></sup><em>Please note:</em> Mandatory Supervision is run by the counties and rules vary from county to county across California. We have tried to provide information here that will be helpful to all, but we encourage you to find out information from your particular county probation office about how Mandatory Supervision operates, and what services or programs are available to you there.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152929"></a>Who can be released onto mandatory supervision?</h3><p>You are eligible for a “split sentence” and Mandatory Supervision if your felony conviction is for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sex offense (the “3 nons”) under law.<sup><a href="#footnote-686" id="footnote-ref-686">[686]</a></sup></p><p>You CANNOT get a “split sentence” if:</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>You have a prior or current felony conviction for a serious felony described in Cal.

The judge in the court that convicted you sets the term and length of mandatory supervision, and it is different for every person depending on what your conviction is for. BUT there are limitations. Split sentences cannot be longer than the maximum sentence possible for the conviction—meaning the total time you serve in custody (in jail) and supervision time (time on Mandatory Supervision) cannot be more than the maximum original sentence.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152934"></a>Can I get off mandatory supervision early?</h3><p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from mandatory supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-689" id="footnote-ref-689">[689]</a></sup></sup> It is entirely up to the judge to decide whether to terminate your mandatory supervision early. Since they are given so much discretion, some judges (and even some whole counties) are unwilling to let people off of mandatory supervision early, regardless of the person’s progress. Many judges see mandatory supervision as an alternative to incarcerating you for the whole time (that’s why it’s called “split sentencing” because the judge split your sentence between incarceration and being on mandatory supervision in the community), so for the most part they are less likely to end your mandatory supervision early as compared with probation. We recommend that you speak with an attorney BEFORE filing a “Motion to Terminate Mandatory Supervision” early. If you go ahead with asking a judge to end your mandatory supervision early (such a request is called a “Motion”) and it is granted, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record!

When you were initially sentenced to probation, the sentencing judge had the option of either ordering that the Execution of Sentence be Suspended (ESS) or ordering that the Imposition of Sentence be Suspended (ISS).

Claims can be based on violations of state or federal constitutional due process rights, California or federal statutes, or California administrative rules. For example, a person could argue that the revocation hearing is being unreasonably delayed, that he or she was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses at the hearing, or that the revocation decision was not supported by the evidence. Unfortunately, in most cases, the process for raising such challenges will be too slow to provide any relief before you serve the entire revocation term.

These are called “release conditions”—they tell you what you can and can’t do in the community. These conditions are broken down into two types: (1) mandatory conditions and (2) discretionary conditions. </p><p><strong><em>Examples include:</em></strong></p><ol class="text">Not being able to own/store guns or other weapons;No contact with victims or witnesses; restrict your association with certain people or groups;Restricted travel;Curfews;Community service;Electronic monitoring;Employment requirements;Mental health treatment;Substance abuse treatment.</ol><p>It is important for you to know what conditions <em>you must follow</em> on federal probation so that you don’t get into trouble or sent to prison for violating those rules. </p><p>Also: be sure to talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about how to get connected to any needed services or resources offered in your community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-771" id="footnote-ref-771">[771]</a></sup></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448152985"></a>Where can I find a written statement of my conditions of federal probation?</h3><p>The judge must direct the probation officer to provide you with a written statement that explains all the conditions you must follow, and is clear and specific enough to guide your conduct under supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-772" id="footnote-ref-772">[772]</a></sup> </p><p>The conditions of supervision are also listed on the “Judgment in a Criminal Case” produced by the court after your sentencing hearing. Ask your attorney or the Clerk of the Court where you were sentenced for a copy of this document so that you can be sure of your obligations to the Court.

The steps below outline both possibilities:</p><p>POSSIBILITY #1: </p><p>If you are moving to a new residence within your current district, follow these steps:</p><h4 class="step">Notify your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move within your current U.S. Probation District—even if it’s across the street.Your Probation Officer will investigate the new address—so long as it is located in the same U.S. Probation District.

This technically keeps your case in the original district, but allows you to live in and travel to the district of your choice. Your probation officer AND the probation officer of the other district have to agree. After doing this, it is much easier to transfer to the courtesy district than to just transfer from one district to another without “courtesy supervision” being set up first.</p><p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>If “courtesy supervision” is denied or doesn’t work out, you can still request a formal transfer. Tell your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move to a new address in a different U.S. Probation District.</p><p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Your Probation Officer must submit a “Transfer Investigation” to the new district. The Transfer Investigation generally takes 30 days or longer, since both your current district and the new district must investigate your new proposed address and approve the transfer. As part of the “Transfer Investigation,” a Probation Officer in the receiving District will:</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p><p><strong>STEP 4: </strong>The receiving District must approve or deny the transfer after conducting the “Transfer Investigation.” The receiving district can deny your request to transfer/move for any reason. The sending district where you are currently supervised must wait for a response before it can act to transfer your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-799" id="footnote-ref-799">[799]</a></sup></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE! Some districts have hard and fast rules about certain offenses—e.g., they won’t accept people with sex offenses, or the receiving district will require a more onerous investigation of that person.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448152997"></a>I am on federal probation and want to move/transfer to a new state. How can I do that?</h3><p>To transfer districts, it’s best to first discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of BOTH your current probation officer AND a probation officer from the new district. Only those transfers that follow the U.S. Parole Commission’s instructions can be approved.<sup><a href="#footnote-800" id="footnote-ref-800">[800]</a></sup></p><p>Go to PG. 261 to learn how to transfer states.

Is it possible to move while a transfer investigation is still pending?</h3><p class="text">Maybe. Sometimes a U.S. Probation Officer will give someone permission to move while an investigation is pending. For example, you may be allowed to move before an official approval of your transfer request if:</p><div class="normal2">An eviction is forcing you out of your home and you have nowhere else to live but at the new address in your current district or a different district;You have a job offer that requires you to start on a specific date;Another emergency reason that requires you to move.</div><h4 class="textbox">IF YOUR NEED TO MOVE IS URGENT:</h4><div class="normal2">You should inform your Probation Officer and request a travel permit while the “Transfer Investigation” and approval are still pending. But please be aware, if the new district completes its “Transfer Investigation” and denies the transfer request <em>for any reason</em>, you would be required to move back to the original sending district.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-801" id="footnote-ref-801">[801]</a></sup></sup> If you do not move back, you will be violating the Court’s Order to follow the directions of the Probation Officer. If the court finds you were not following the directions of your Probation Officer, it can revoke your supervision and send you to prison.</div><h3><a id="_Toc448153001"></a>Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?</h3><p class="text">Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor’s approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-802" id="footnote-ref-802">[802]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153002"></a>I am on federal probation, and I’m trying to move in with someone who lives in government-assisted housing (like public housing, section 8, or a voucher program), can I still move in?</h3><p class="text">It depends.

You cannot use or distribute illegal drugs, or frequent places where others use or distribute drugs.You cannot associate with people engaged in criminal activity. (This means you cannot hang out with or spend time with people who are committing crimes.) You cannot associate with anyone convicted of a felony unless your U.S. probation officer gives you permission to do so. (Again, this means that unless your probation officer says differently, you are not allowed to hang out with or spend time with someone who has been convicted of a felony. Just spending time with someone who has been convicted of a felony can be considered a violation of your probation, even if you were not doing anything else wrong.) You must let your probation officer to visit you any time at home or elsewhere.You must let your probation officer to take any contraband that he or she finds in plain view around you.You must get in touch with your U.S. probation officer within 3 days (72 hours) if you’re arrested or questioned by law enforcement (again, some officers will require you to report faster, so check your conditions).You cannot serve as an informant to law enforcement without court permission.As directed by your U.S. probation officer, you must notify other people about any risks that your criminal record, personal history or characteristics might pose; and you must allow your U.S. probation officer to notify people of any risks posed by your criminal record, personal history or characteristics.You must pay any court-ordered “special assessment” and fines, and follow any court-ordered payment plan set up for you. You must notify your U.S. probation officer if there is any significant change in your income or economic circumstances which would impact how much you can pay towards any unpaid restitution, fines, or special assessments (NOTE: this is a mandatory condition for people on federal probation, and a recommended “standard condition” for people on Supervised Release).</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153023"></a>What additional discretionary conditions may I have to follow on supervised release? </h3><p class="text">If the above legal standards are met (refer to PG. 226), the judge may order additional discretionary conditions on your Supervised Release. As discussed, the Standard Conditions listed on PG. 337 above are almost always added. For a full list of discretionary conditions that may be added see Appendix DD, PG. 339):</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153024"></a>Can my conditions of supervised release be changed?</h3><p class="text">Yes. A judge may change, reduce, or increase your conditions before your Supervised Release term ends.<sup><a href="#footnote-840" id="footnote-ref-840">[840]</a></sup> A probation officer can also change your conditions of Supervised Release. Changes in conditions (called “modifications”) usually happen because you got in trouble with your probation officer (for example, you tested dirty on a drug test), or you didn’t follow a condition of your Supervised Release. In this type of situation, the probation officer will usually ask a judge to change your conditions, often with the consent of your attorney, to get an order for you to do something (for example, to get an order that you go into in-patient, residential substance abuse treatment). PRACTICE TIP—AN ATTORNEY CAN HELP YOU: It’s been suggested that it is sometimes easier to work out any changes to your conditions of supervised release directly with your probation officer, rather than go before a judge. To protect yourself in this type of situation, it is best to “invoke your right to counsel”—meaning ask for an attorney to represent you—and then you can communicate with your attorney who will work something out with the probation officer or represent you before the judge if the issue ends up going back to court.<sup><a href="#footnote-841" id="footnote-ref-841">[841]</a></sup> </p><p class="importantbox">WARNING: Sometimes a U.S. probation officer will ask you to waive (give up) your right to an attorney and submit to a change of your conditions of Supervised Release (called a “modification”).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-842" id="footnote-ref-842">[842]</a></sup></strong> You may be asked (directly or indirectly) to give up your right to an attorney. You should NOT give up this right. You should “invoke your right to counsel instead,” and ask for an attorney. If you do not agree to changes in the conditions of your Supervised Release, then any changes will require the same justification as conditions imposed during the original sentencing hearing.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-843" id="footnote-ref-843">[843]</a></sup></strong></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153025"></a>How do I challenge unlawful discretionary conditions that were added on to my supervised release?</h3><p class="text">Within 14 days of your sentencing hearing, you must file a Notice of Appeal with the Clerk of the Court where you were convicted.<sup><a href="#footnote-844" id="footnote-ref-844">[844]</a></sup> Once this occurs, you should contact the Federal Public Defender’s Office in your federal judicial district. .

How can I do that? </h3><p class="text">The process depends on whether you are asking to move to a new residence <em>within the same district</em> OR to a new residence <em>in a different district</em>. A district is the geographic area that a district federal court has power to make decisions over—for example, California has four federal districts: Southern District, Northern District, Central District, and Eastern District. </p><p><strong>In a nutshell, it’s easier to move within the same district than to move to a new one. The steps below outline both possibilities:</strong></p><p>POSSIBILITY #1: If you are moving to a new residence within your current district, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>STEP 1: Notify your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move within your current U.S. Probation District—even if it’s across the street.</strong></p><p><strong>STEP 2: Your Probation Officer will investigate the new address—so long as it is located in the same U.S. Probation District. As part of that investigation, your Probation Officer will:</strong></p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.<sup><a href="#footnote-849" id="footnote-ref-849">[849]</a></sup>Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p><p>POSSIBILITY #2: If you are moving to a new residence outside of your current U.S. Probation District, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>STEP 1: HELPFUL HINT!!!—Before you ask for a formal transfer to a new district—which can be a longer, more challenging process—ask your probation officer for what is called “courtesy supervision” by another district. This technically keeps your case in the original district, but allows you to live in and travel to the district of your choice. Your probation officer AND the probation officer of the other district have to agree. After doing this, it is much easier to transfer to the courtesy district than to just transfer from one district to another without “courtesy supervision” being set up first.</strong></p><p><strong>STEP 2: If “courtesy supervision” is denied or doesn’t work out, you can still request a formal transfer. Tell your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move to a new address in a different U.S. Probation District.</strong></p><p><strong>STEP 3: Your Probation Officer must submit a “Transfer Investigation” to the new district. The Transfer Investigation generally takes 30 days or longer, since both your current district and the new district must investigate your new proposed address and approve the transfer. As part of the “Transfer Investigation,” a Probation Officer in the receiving District will:</strong></p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p><p><strong>STEP 4: The receiving district must approve or deny the transfer after completing the “Transfer Investigation.” The receiving district can deny your request to transfer for any reason. The sending district where you are currently supervised must wait for a response before it can transfer your supervision.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-850" id="footnote-ref-850">[850]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE! Some districts have hard and fast rules about certain offenses—e.g., they won’t accept people with sex offenses, or the receiving district will require a more onerous investigation of that person.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153028"></a>I am on supervised release and want to move/transfer to a new state. How can I do that?</h3><p class="text">To transfer districts, you need to discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of both your probation officer from the current district AND a probation officer from the new district. You can only transfer if it doesn’t go against the instructions from the U.S. Parole Commission.<sup><a href="#footnote-851" id="footnote-ref-851">[851]</a></sup> Go to PG. 261 to learn how to transfer states. An Interstate Compact governs all transfers between states, and applies to all types of supervision (state parole, county probation and other county-level forms of supervision, federal probation, supervised release, and federal parole).</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153029"></a>What are some <em>positive factors</em> that could help my request to move/ transfer be approved?</h3><p class="text">Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District.

The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:</p><ol class="text">No job offer in new area;No or weak family and community ties in the new area;Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;The new address where you want to move is unsafe;Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; andThe residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153031"></a>I am on federal probation or supervised release. Is it possible to move while a transfer investigation is still pending?</h3><div class="normal2">Maybe. Sometimes a U.S. Probation Officer will give someone permission to move while an investigation is pending. For example, you may be allowed to move before an official approval of your transfer request if:An eviction is forcing you out of your home and you have nowhere else to live but at the new address in your current district or a different district;You have a job offer that requires you to start on a specific date;Another emergency reason that requires you to move.</div><h4 class="textbox">IF YOUR NEED TO MOVE IS URGENT:</h4><div class="normal2">You should inform your Probation Officer and request a travel permit while the “Transfer Investigation” and approval are still pending. But please be aware, if the new district completes its “Transfer Investigation” and denies the transfer request for any reason, you would be required to move back to the original sending district.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-852" id="footnote-ref-852">[852]</a></sup></sup> If you do not move back, you will be violating the Court’s Order to follow the directions of the Probation Officer. If the court finds you were not following the directions of your Probation Officer, it can revoke your supervision and send you to prison.</div><h3><a id="_Toc448153032"></a>Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?</h3><p class="text">Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor’s approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-853" id="footnote-ref-853">[853]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153033"></a>I am on supervised release, and I’m trying to move in with someone I know.

If the family member or person you want to move in with lives in subsidized housing, there might be federal, state, or local laws that restrict someone on federal probation or Supervised Release from moving into the residence.

These will include creating a release plan, creating a plan for payment of restitution and fines, investigation of your plan, and release. Please see the Appendix II, PG. 348 to find out more. </p><p><strong>STEP 1: Release Plan</strong></p><p class="text">Once you have a release date from the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC), you must complete a satisfactory plan for parole supervision to actually get released. If the release plan is NOT approved, your release may be delayed regardless of the date the USPC had set when it first granted your parole.The Regional Commissioner of the USPC may change your date of release (earlier or later) onto parole to allow more time for release planning. At most, the Regional Commissioner can delay your release onto parole for 120 days; otherwise, you have the right to a hearing if the Regional Commissioner wants to push back your release date more than 120 days.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-892" id="footnote-ref-892">[892]</a></sup></sup></p><p><strong>Generally, you are required to have the following included in your release plan:</strong></p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Availability of legitimate employment;An approved residence for the prospective parolee; andAvailability of necessary aftercare if you are ill or will require special care.<sup><a href="#footnote-893" id="footnote-ref-893">[893]</a></sup></strong></p><p><strong>STEP 2: Unpaid Fines &amp; Restitution</strong></p><p>Your release onto parole might also be delayed if you still owe court-ordered fines or restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-894" id="footnote-ref-894">[894]</a></sup> When you still have fines or restitution to pay, a reasonable plan for payment, or a performance of services, if ordered by the court, will be included in your parole release plan, where feasible.<sup><a href="#footnote-895" id="footnote-ref-895">[895]</a></sup></p><p><strong>STEP 3: Investigation Phase</strong></p><p>Your U.S. Probation Officer will do an investigation to make sure that the person’s release plan is appropriate. This investigation will start with the probation officer asking you questions about your release plan. The probation officer will then follow up and verify your answers. For example, if you told the probation officer that your approved residence did not have any persons with a felony record, the probation officer will follow-up to make sure this is true. </p><p><strong>STEP 4: Release</strong></p><p>After the Parole Commission approves your release plan, and a U.S. Probation Officer completes an investigation, you will be released on the date set by the Parole Commission (unless there is misconduct or some other reason leading to a change in the date). </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153051"></a>What could happen if I refuse to sign the certificate of release?</h3><p>If you don’t sign the certificate of release, one of the two following things could happen:</p><p class="text">If you have been granted a parole date and you refuse to sign the certificate of release (or any other document necessary to fulfill a condition of release), the USPC will treat your refusal as a withdrawal of your application for parole, effective on the date of your refusal. You will not be released on parole and you will have to reapply for parole consideration.If you are scheduled for release to supervision through good-time deduction and you refuse to sign the certificate of release, you will be released but you still must follow the conditions listed on the certificate of release, or risk violation and revocation (see Appendix GG, PG. 344).<sup><a href="#footnote-896" id="footnote-ref-896">[896]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153052"></a>Do I have to return to the same community that I came from for my federal parole?</h3><p>Usually, yes. In most instances, you will be released to parole in the U.S. Judicial District of your legal residence, or in the U.S. Judicial District where you were convicted of the federal offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-897" id="footnote-ref-897">[897]</a></sup> </p><p>THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION: if the U.S. Parole Commission decides that your chances of success on parole will be better in another community, or believes it would serve “the public interest,” it can order you be paroled to a different District.<sup><a href="#footnote-898" id="footnote-ref-898">[898]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153053"></a>What is the difference between federal parole and “mandatory release”?</h3><p>If you are never granted parole during your prison sentence, you will be released through “Mandatory Release” (unless you have forfeited all your statutory “good time credits”). The institution’s officials set your Mandatory Release date by calculating how much statutory “good time” credit you have a legal right to, and how much extra “good time” is earned. </p><p>The law states that if you are entitled to Mandatory Release, you must “be treated as if released on parole” and are “subject to all provisions of the law relating to the parole of United States prisoners until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which [you were] sentenced, less 180 days.” What this really means is that you should have a release plan (see question above) as if you were going out on parole. You will also be supervised by a U.S. Probation Officer as if on federal parole until <em>180 days before the end date of your sentence</em>—so long as you don’t violate the conditions of your mandatory release, in which case the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC) can hold you under supervision until the original full term date of the sentence. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153054"></a>Is it possible that I be released from federal prison and not be on any type of community supervision?</h3><p class="text">Yes, it is possible, but rare. If you are NOT paroled and have less than 180 days left on your original sentence when you are released, you will be released <em>without supervision</em>. However, if a “special parole term” is being served, supervision will end at the full term date, and this 180-day date does not apply.</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153055"></a>After Release: What to Expect in Your First Days Out on Federal Parole</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153056"></a>After I am released to federal parole, when and to whom must I report?</h3><p>US.

There are several steps you can take to try and rectify the situation. </p><p>STEP 1: If your disability makes it difficult to comply with your federal probation or parole conditions, or your conditions are overly strict and cause you harm due to your disability, the first thing to do is talk with your U.S. probation officer.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-993" id="footnote-ref-993">[993]</a></sup></sup> You should explain:</p><p><em>Your disability</em>; </p><p><em>Which condition of supervision</em> is causing you problems due to your disability (e.g., drug testing conditions that prevent you from taking necessary medication) or how you are being <em>treated differently</em> due to your disability (e.g., you are stopped from participating in certain programs due to your disability or related medical treatment) or why you need additional help to participate in activities or follow the rules of supervision; <em>and</em></p><p><em>What accommodations</em> (like changes in rules, policies, or procedures), services, or other assistance you need for your disability.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-994" id="footnote-ref-994">[994]</a></sup></sup></p><p>If you have any other documents—such as a letter from your doctor or prescription for medication—you should show that to your probation officer. You can also remind your probation officer that federal law requires him or her to provide “reasonable accommodations” for your disability. Your probation officer, along with the judge and any medical providers who help you with your disability, will consider your situation and make a case-by-case decision about whether and how to accommodate your disability.</p><p>STEP 2: If you are unhappy with your probation officer’s decision, you can ask a supervisor for assistance. If the probation department does not provide the assistance you need, you can go to court to request a change in your supervision conditions or other accommodations.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-995" id="footnote-ref-995">[995]</a></sup></sup> </p><p>STEP 3: You have the right to file an administrative complaint with the Department of Justice, which will investigate and attempt to resolve cases of discrimination based on disability, including a hearing and appeal process.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-996" id="footnote-ref-996">[996]</a></sup></sup> Note, however that this process can take a long time to complete, so it’s best as a last resort.</p><h2><a id="_Toc448153095"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p class="text">Being under some type of supervision is usually required for you to be released from prison or jail.

There are two important dates: the “controlling discharge date” (CDD) and the “maximum discharge date” (MDD). The CDD is the date that a parolee is currently set to be discharged from parole if nothing changes. The MDD is the maximum parole term as set by statute, after which the parolee must be discharged. Two types of events may change the CDD and MDD:</p><ol class="text">Time during which a parolee absconds or is unavailable for supervision does not count toward either the CDD or MDD. There is no limit on how long the CDD and MDD can be extended due to absconding or unavailability.Time served in custody for parole revocation terms will extend the CDD, but only until the MDD is reached.</ol><p class="text">The pieces of information a parolee needs to figure out his or her CDD and MDD are: (1) the initial parole date; (2) the base and maximum parole terms that apply to his or her case (see Section 16.A, above); (3) how much time he or she has been unavailable for supervision, if any; and (4) the amount of time he or she has served in custody on parole violations. Here is a calculation worksheet that can be used by any parolee, with an example of a calculation for a parolee named Joe who is serving a three-year parole term with a maximum term of four years following a determinate sentence for a non-serious, non-violent, non-sex offense. </p><p><strong>Worksheet</strong></p><table><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Start with the date the parolee was first paroled. For our example, Joe paroled on January 1, 2013.</strong></p></td><td><p>1/1/2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Add the amount of time the parolee must serve before a presumptive discharge review. Joe has a presumptive discharge date of six months plus 30 days, and was eligible for early discharge on July 1, 2013.</strong></p></td><td><p>7/1/2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>However, the BPH acted to retain Joe on parole, so his CDD will be set by his full statutory base parole period. Joe has a three-year base parole period, so his CDD is January 1, 2016. Joe has a statutory maximum parole term of four years, so his MDD is January 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>1/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>1/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe absconded from parole, and the “clock” on his parole term stopped running during that time. This extends both the CDD and the MDD. Joe absconded for three months, so his CDD is now April 1, 2016, and his MDD is now April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>4/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe also violated parole and served a parole revocation term in custody. This extends the CDD but only until the MDD is reached. Joe’s revocation term was 180 days, but he only served 90 days in jail because he behaved well and got good conduct credits. Thus, 90 days is added to his CDD, which is now July 1, 2016. The revocation time does not affect Joe’s MDD, which is still April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>7/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe violated parole two more times and got two more 180-day revocation terms (360 days total); while he was in jail, Joe got into fights and refused to work, so he did not get any good conduct credits. The time Joe spends in jail extends his CDD but does not affect his MDD. Also, since a CDD cannot be further in the future than an MDD, Joe has “maxed out” and will be discharged on April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>4/1/2017 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr></table><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: if your parole length seems wrong, you can challenge it (it’s a similar process to challenging a parole condition).

A habeas corpus petition can be based on any rights guaranteed by the federal or state constitutions, statutes, or regulations. Through a habeas corpus petition, a state parolee (just like a state prisoner challenging conditions of his/her confinement) can ask a court to order “injunctive relief,” meaning that the court will order prison or parole officials to do something or to stop doing something.

The clerk will give you back your copy, plus any copies that need to be served on the other parties. Remember to make sure that the clerk stamps each of these copies! Be sure to confirm with the clerk if the clerk’s office will serve the District Attorney and the Probation Department, or if you are responsible for doing that. If the clerk gives you back more than just your own copy, it most likely means that you are responsible for service!

You can also ask the court to order the probation department to provide certain assistance or other accommodations. The prosecutor will also have a chance to speak, including a chance to oppose your request for modification. For more information on disabilities, please see PG. 269.</p><ol class="text">FEES/ COST: Be aware that there are always fees associated with filing documents with the court. These fees will vary by county, and you can request a fee waiver if you qualify. Check with the clerk for your county’s fee schedule and waiver request process.

It is best to serve the motion on all necessary people (parties) right after you file it. Be sure to have the DA’s office stamp the copy of your motion that you are keeping for yourself too—this serves as your proof that you served the DA with your motion. </ol><h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4><ol class="text">When you file your motion, the clerk will give you a court date for your motion to be heard by a judge. You will have to attend the hearing if you are not being represented by an attorney. In most cases, even if you are being represented by an attorney, you will want to be present to show your respect to the judge and the court process. The judge is unlikely to modify your probation unless it thinks that you are taking your probation seriously—and going to your court date shows the judge that you care about your case!<sup><a href="#footnote-1035" id="footnote-ref-1035">[1035]</a></sup> If the judge grants your motion or modifies your probation conditions in any other way, he or she must state the reasons for doing so on the record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1036" id="footnote-ref-1036">[1036]</a></sup></sup></ol><div class="appendix"><a id="PP_AppZ_prcsreleaseprocess"></a>Appendix Z</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="PP_TOC_Z"></a>Sample Instructions for PRCS from Different Counties in California</div><p>WARNING: You must report to your County Probation Department for PRCS supervision within 2 working days after your release from state prison, court, or county jail.

If you have to do any evaluations with other agencies or service providers (for example, if the Probation Department does a risk- or needs-assessment for you, or you have a work placement evaluation by the Sheriff’s department), you should also explain to them why your disability makes it difficult for you to participate or meet other requirements.<em>If you were sentenced under Realignment and are on Mandatory Supervision or PRCS,</em> you may be entitled to participate in special programs or other services for your disability.<sup><a href="#footnote-1039" id="footnote-ref-1039">[1039]</a></sup></strong></p><h4 class="step">If that didn’t fix the problem, you can ask the judge to modify your probation to accommodate your disability by filing a motion requesting a change (called a “modification”). </h4><p>If after talking to your probation officer or their supervisor, you still need help because (1) you did not get the assistance you require for your disability, (2) you are unable to participate in the programs which you are being offered or required to participate in, or (3) the terms of your supervision are difficult for you due to your disability, then you can go back to court to request help from the judge. </p><p>In order to ask the judge to modify your probation, you must FILE A MOTION requesting that the judge modify probation to accommodate your disability.

See the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130 to learn about how your rules (called “conditions”) of supervision affect where you can live after release. There is more information about different types of short-term housing beginning on PG. 364.</p><h4 class="step">GET YOUR ID. </h4><p class="text">Most housing programs will require proof of who you are, your age, and any income you receive.

Depending on who owns and runs the housing (private vs. government-assisted—see PG. 375), you will have different rights in the process.IT’S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO FIND HELP, if you can. Find an attorney, advocate, case manager, friend or family member, or probation/parole officer who can help you find housing. It is very important to have support in this process and throughout reentry. There is a list of helpful community resources in the back of this guide on PG. 1190 if you want ideas about where to look for help.FINDING HOUSING IS TOUGH BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE—be patient and keep looking!SOME OF YOUR OPTIONS. Depending on whether you are currently incarcerated or already out, affordability, eligibility, and whether you are looking for short-term or long-term housing, you will have different types of housing options available to you. As you move further into your reentry, these options are likely to change over time.</ul><h4 class="sidebox">STAY POSITIVE!</h4><p class="sidebox">Finding housing can be an exhausting process, but don’t give up. Reach out for help. There are resources listed throughout this chapter, and also a list of legal services providers on PG. 1180.Call us at Root &amp; Rebound (510-279-4662) if you have an emergency, and we may be able to refer you someone to help.</p><p class="text">Yes, it is possible. First, you may want to think about (1) what you need in the short-term vs. long-term; (2) how your parole or probation (or other type of supervision) affects where you can live; and (3) whether you want to look for private housing, government-assisted housing, or both. To help with this process, read about<em> your housing options</em>, starting on PG. 360.There are additional considerations if you plan to move in with family or friends. You will want to ask them to find out everything possible about the guest policies where they live, and/or about adding someone to their apartment lease. If the housing your family or friend lives in receives <em>any form of government assistance</em>, they may also need to contact their local Public Housing Authority (PHA) to let them know they would like to add you to the household. A list of PHAs in California and their contact information can be found here: APPENDIX A, PG. 442 or online here: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/states/ca.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/states/ca.cfm</a>. Learn more about moving in with family and friends beginning on PG. 417.If you want to find transitional or emergency housing, generally you or a family member, friend or advocate will have to directly write or call the housing facility to ask about what the requirements are. For a list of transitional housing programs that may accept you while you are still incarcerated, see APPENDIX B, PG. 448.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153102"></a>What are some steps I can take if I am worried about becoming homeless?</h3><p class="text">An important step to avoid becoming homeless is to begin planning and identifying housing options <em>while you’re still incarcerated</em> (see question above addressing this topic, PG. 361). There are also agencies and nonprofits in the community working to help people find permanent housing and avoid/get out of homelessness. Here are some organizations that may be able to help:</p><ol class="text"><em>The Public Housing Authority (PHA) in your area: </em>PHAs sometimes give preference to admitting homeless individuals into the Public Housing program or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers. Visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website to find public housing authorities in your area: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm</a><a id="Emergency_shelters"></a><em>Emergency shelters and assistance: </em>HUD maintains a list of organizations throughout the country that provide emergency shelter and assistance to homeless individuals (visit the following website: <a href="http://nhl.gov/homeless/hmlsagen.cfm">http://nhl.gov/homeless/hmlsagen.cfm</a>) .<em>The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans </em>has an online list of organizations throughout the country that will assist homeless veterans on a variety of issues including housing (visit the following website: <a href="http://www.nchv.org/network.cfm">http://www.nchv.org/network.cfm</a>).<em>The National Coalition for the Homeless </em>has links to databases related to for local service organizations, educating homeless children, transitional housing, drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers, and day shelters (visit the following website: <a href="http://www.nationalhomeless.org/resources/index.html">http://www.nationalhomeless.org/resources/index.html</a>).</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153103"></a>Will my parole or probation officer help me find somewhere to live?</h3><p class="text">It depends, but usually not. But it’s always worth asking your supervising officer if they know of any housing resources!</p><h4>If you are on California state parole: </h4><p class="text">There is very little help for housing. In some counties, some parole officers may work with local boarding houses, hotels, or motels to find you a temporary place to stay.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1074" id="footnote-ref-1074">[1074]</a></sup></sup></span> Additionally, there could be funding from the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR) for you to stay a short amount of time in transitional housing (most of those programs are run by the CDCR’s Division of Rehabilitative Programs, which you can read more online at: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/what-we-do.html">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/what-we-do.html</a>). You can also ask your correctional counselor (if you’re incarcerated) or your parole officer (if you are living in the community) about what types of funding exists for transitional housing while you are on state parole. If your parole officer is unable to help you find short-term, transitional or emergency housing, you may try going to an emergency shelter (see PG. 362.) As a last resort, you may have to use your Gate Money (read more about Gate Money in the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER on PG. 150) to pay for a hotel or motel, until you find a more permanent living situation. </p><h4>If you are on California county-level supervision like probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision: </h4><p class="text">Ask your probation/supervising officer about what local programs are available. Ask if they can make referrals to affordable housing agencies or nonprofits that advocate for low-income people to find housing.</p><h4>If you are on federal probation, supervised release, or federal parole: </h4><p class="text">Ask your federal Probation Officer for a list of affordable housing options in the area. Federal probation officers will not normally release you from a transitional (“halfway”) house unless you have a plan for permanent housing. Also, read about some of your options for long-term housing on PG. 366 of this chapter.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153104"></a>What are my housing options after release? </h3><p class="text">Again, there are many different housing options out there—transitional housing programs, emergency shelters, special needs housing, assisted-living housing, living with family or friends, private apartments and houses, and apartments and houses that get government money to make them more affordable for their residents. To make it easier to plan and prepare, we suggest thinking about your housing options in two categories: (1) short-term housing and (2) long-term/ permanent housing. Also, consider whether government-assisted housing makes sense in your situation.</p><a id="Shortterm_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153105"></a><h1 class="subheading">Short-term housing overview</h1><h4 class="sidebox">What is GOVERNMENT-assisted hOUSING? Why would I be interested in it?</h4><p class="sidebox">See PG. 375 to learn more about government assisted housing and the different rules that apply for them.<strong> </strong></p><p class="text">When you are preparing for release or first get out of prison or jail, most of your housing options will be focused on short-term and transitional housing. Examples of short-term housing include: staying with a family member; staying with a friend; staying in a shelter (shelters usually offer a bed and shower for one or more nights, and sometimes offer other free services); and living in a transitional housing program.</p><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Staying_friends_family"></a><a id="_Toc448153106"></a>Staying with family or friends:</h2><p class="text">Here are some pros and cons to consider if you want to move in with family or friends.</p><table><tr><td><p>PROS</p></td><td><p>CONS</p></td></tr><tr><td><ul class="textbox">If you have friends or family in the area, staying short-term with them can be an option for immediate housing.Friends and family can be supportive and useful in helping you successfully reenter the community.A few days or weeks on someone’s couch or in their spare bedroom can give you enough time to go to get social services, start looking for jobs, and arrange for longer term housing.You will likely have greater independence in your life.It will be free or at a lower cost because you are splitting the rent.</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">If you are under supervision after your release, your housing will need to be approved by your probation/parole officer or supervising agency.Home visits by parole/probation officers, search conditions, and other restrictions don’t just affect you; they also affect your host and other household members. (SEE CHAPTER ON PAROLE &amp; PROBATION, PG. 163)If you are a guest in someone’s home or apartment, your stay could cause the family living there to violate the property’s guest policy if you stay beyond the time limit allowed for guests and/or you violate some other rule in the property’s guest policy (see more on PG. 421).</ul></td></tr></table><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153107"></a>Shelters:</h2><p class="text">Most shelters are free, and usually offer a bed and shower for one night or multiple nights, and sometimes services such as counseling and job-search assistance. While transitional and permanent housing options can take time to arrange, you can usually access a shelter immediately. Here are some of the main types of shelters that exist:</p><ol class="text"><strong>24-hour Shelters</strong>—24-hour shelters let you to stay at night and during the day and participate in the services the shelter offers (for example: meals, counseling, and job training, just to name a few). Don’t let the name mislead you—a 24-hour shelter doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave after 24 hours: in the Bay Area, for example, many 24-hour shelters have beds available for up to 30-90 days; and other shelters reserve beds for people who are participating in special programs, like a required work-program. The key is that 24-hour shelters are open day and night. Ask the specific shelter you’re interested in about any other requirements or restrictions it has.<strong>12-hour Shelters</strong>—12-hour shelters let you stay for a 12-hour period overnight (usually 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), but require you to leave in the morning.<strong>Day Shelters</strong> let you come and take advantage of their services during the day, but you can’t stay overnight. Services at day shelters may include showers, meals, computer access, and optional programs like case management/support services and counseling sessions.<strong>Family Shelters</strong> have places to stay for you and the rest of your family. They tend to be 24-hour shelters (see the first type of shelter listed above).<strong>Domestic Violence Shelters</strong> take women (usually not men) who are trying to find safety from someone who is abusive. They usually have confidential addresses for the safety of the residents. Many domestic violence shelters also allow women to bring their children with them.</ol><h2 class="subheading2"> <a id="Transitional_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153108"></a>Transitional housing programs:</h2><p class="text">Transitional housing programs are temporary programs that offer housing and services. Keep in mind they usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. Examples of transitional housing programs include:<em> </em>shared or private apartments, residential programs that allow for temporary stays (from 3 months to 2 years) at no cost or at a low cost, and sober living environments (SLE) (read more about SLEs on PG. 373). Some transitional housing programs also have services like job training, counseling, general education development (“GED”) programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are for people with specific needs such as mental health support, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 373), or safety from domestic violence (see PG. 368). </p><a id="_Toc448153109"></a><h3>Can I get into a transitional housing program if I am still incarcerated?</h3><h4 class="sidebox">How CAN I show Proof of homelessness</h4><p class="sidebox">For proof of homelessness, most housing providers will just need a signed statement. If the housing provider asks for further documentation, you may need to show eviction papers, a letter from a social worker, etc. Some organizations will also issue certificates of homelessness, for example:Coalition on Homelessness<br />488 Turk Street<br />San Francisco, CA 94102<br />Phone: (415) 346-3740<br /><em>Certificates of Homelessness are issued Mondays and Wednesdays 10 a.m.–12 p.m.</em></p><p class="answer"><em>It depends on the program. </em>Unfortunately, most transitional housing programs will not let you fill out an application or get on the waitlist before your release. A few let you apply from inside prison or jail, but may have other requirements or restrictions. Go to APPENDIX B on PG. 448 for a partial list of transitional housing options in California that <em>may</em> accept residents who write to them from inside prison or jail.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153110"></a>What may I need to get to be accepted into transitional housing?</h3><p class="answer"><em>It depends</em>—each program has different requirements. You might need: identification (learn how to get different types of identification in the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING, beginning on PG. 21); proof of homelessness; proof of any income; proof of your sobriety; police clearance; to get through the waitlist; to have an interview; etc. It’s best to CALL (or if you’re currently incarcerated, ask a family member or friend to call, or WRITE the program a letter with your request) to find out well in advance of when you want to move exactly what you need to do and what the requirements are!</p><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153111"></a>Special needs housing—short- or long-term</h2><p class="text">There are also housing programs for people with specific needs such as sober living environments that offer addiction treatment and recovery, safety from domestic violence, assisted living for people with disabilities or mental health needs, housing programs for women with children, veterans, and 290 sex offender registrants. These are often transitional housing programs that are for a short term only; others are intended to be long-term/permanent housing for people with special needs.

Many of these programs operate both:</p><ol class="text">Emergency shelters (typical stay = 30–60 days), ANDTransitional housing programs (typical stay = 6–18 months)</ol><p class="text">In addition to providing shelter to survivors, both these programs often provide services such as 24-hour hotlines, legal assistance with restraining orders and child-custody disputes, advocates who can go to court appearances to support you, counseling for you and your children, and referrals to other social services.Most emergency and homeless shelters for survivors do not conduct criminal background checks (although they are permitted to do so, as long as they follow all of the background check rules on PG. 407). In addition, most shelters are aware that survivors often face criminal charges and/or arrest warrants in connection with the violence that they’ve experienced. Many shelters have relationships with local law enforcement, and are able to accommodate survivors who are under supervision (like probation, parole, etc.).</p><h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTS &amp; RESOURCES</h4><p class="textbox">You should keep in mind that each shelter is different, so the rules and opportunities may not be the same everywhere. There may also be some variation from county to county.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1076" id="footnote-ref-1076">[1076]</a></sup></sup></span> To find a domestic violence shelter or transitional housing program in your area, contact the <strong>National Domestic Violence Hotline</strong> at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or call 211.

Moreover, a landlord may not deny you housing or discriminate against you based on your past addiction or alcoholism.For more information on housing protections for people with addiction-based disabilities, including what information a landlord CAN and CANNOT ask or consider, the following guide may be helpful: <em>Fair Housing for People with Disabilities</em>, by Mental Health Advocacy Services, Inc., pages 18-20, available online at: <a href="http://www.mhas-la.org/FH%20Manual%20rev.4-07.pdf">http://www.mhas-la.org/FH%20Manual%20rev.4-07.pdf</a>.For more information on asking for reasonable accommodations—where you could ask a landlord to make an exception to their policy banning former addicts from housing (since past addiction is a protected disability), go to Appendix D, PG. 453.</p><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Sex_offenders"></a><a id="_Toc448153121"></a>290 Sex Offender Registrants &amp; Residency Restrictions</h2><p class="text">Recently, there have been some important changes in the law governing residency restriction for 290 sex offender registrants. Up until March 2015, as a result of Proposition 83 (“Jessica’s Law”), there were strict residency restrictions on people who were required to register as sex offenders under California Penal Code Section 290. If this law applied to you, you could not reside <em>within 2,000 feet</em> of any school or park where children regularly gather.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1094" id="footnote-ref-1094">[1094]</a></sup></sup></span> In March 2015, the California Supreme Court declared that the blanket residency restriction for all sex offenders required to register under California Penal Code Section 290 is illegal. Now CDCR can place special restrictions on registered sex offenders in the form of discretionary (decided specifically for you) parole conditions.

There are very specific legal requirements for how a government-assisted housing provider can access, look at, and consider your criminal record, and different requirements for what a private landlord can access, look at, and consider. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE TERMS USED IN THE HOUSING CHAPTER: We use the term “government-assisted” housing throughout this Chapter to refer to housing programs and owners of housing that receive money from the federal government. We do not use “public housing” to talk about any and all housing that gets government money because there is actually a specific program run by the government called the “Public Housing” program. So when we use the term “Public Housing,” we are referring to the specific Public Housing program, NOT all housing that receives government support.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153123"></a>How can I figure out if I am applying to/living in private or government-assisted housing?</h3><ol class="text">Did you apply for the housing through a PHA?<em>If yes, the rules and criminal record exclusions that apply to federal government-assisted housing apply to you.</em>Do you have a “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher? <em>If yes, the rules and criminal record exclusions that apply to federal government-assisted housing apply to you.</em>Look up the property online at: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm</a><em>If you still don’t know, ask the OWNER of the property.</em></ol><p class="text">Sometimes it’s clear that you live in government-assisted housing because you had to apply for the housing unit or program through a local Public Housing Authority (PHA) or your landlord <em>is the PHA itself</em>.

Private housing could be an apartment, house, shelter, month-to-month lease, or year-to-year lease. It could be owned by a single owner or by a large property management company where you only interact with the housing managers and not the owner(s) themselves. …<em>VERSUS…</em></p><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Government_Assisted_Housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153125"></a>Government-Assisted Housing</h2><p class="text">If you are a low-income person or household and you are looking for affordable rental housing in your area, you may want to apply for government-assisted housing. The federal government funds most government-assisted housing programs. They have many rules about who can and can’t live there, including a lot of rules about how a criminal record affects your ability to live there (read about those rules and exclusions on PG. 379). Government-assisted housing is designed for low-income people.For some government-assisted housing programs, the government runs the housing facilities and EVERYTHING about the housing application process. For other federally assisted housing programs, the government works with private companies or private owners/landlords who run their own facilities and have their own separate application process from the government.Government-assisted housing could be short-term, long-term, an apartment, a house, a shelter, or a transitional housing program with services.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153126"></a>Why would I be interested in living in government-assisted housing?</h3><p class="text">Government-assisted housing is a great option for many low-income people and households. While they have many rules about who can and cannot live there, it provides you with an opportunity to have affordable rental housing in your area. See PG. 376 below for the resources that can help you find government-assisted housing in your area.</p><h3><a id="Finding_Gov_Asst_Housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153127"></a>How can I find government-assisted housing?</h3><p class="text">Try the following resources to find government-assisted housing:</p><ol class="text">YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY (PHA), which runs some of the biggest government-assisted housing programs, including the Public Housing program and the Housing Choice Voucher program (commonly known as “Section 8” or the voucher program).SEARCH ONLINE: To find your local PHA on the web, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) website at: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm</a>. Once at the website, select your state, then, look for your local PHA by the name of your city or county.SEARCH IN THE PHONE BOOK: If you don’t have a regular access to a computer, look in your phone book in the government or business sections for your local Public Housing Authority (PHA). Some areas have both city and county PHAs; others just have a city PHA. In the government section of the phone book, first look for the city, then look for “housing authority” or “housing department” (for example, the San Francisco Housing Authority, or the Oakland Housing Authority). Sometimes, the local PHA will be listed under the city’s housing department.OTHER GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, NOT THROUGH YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY (PHA):PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT LANDLORDS operate other forms of government-assisted rental housing programs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains a searchable list of these programs online here: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm</a> LOW INCOME TAX CREDIT HOUSING is an affordable rental housing developed through the Internal Revenue Services’ (IRS) Low Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC). Typically, this housing does not serve extremely low-income households, but it is less expensive than similar private housing in the community. LIHTC housing is owned and operated by private owners and nonprofit agencies and is monitored in each state by a state agency. Frequently, but not always, that agency is the state housing finance agency. Some of these agencies may have lists of persons and organizations that operate LIHTC housing in your state. In CA, it’s the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee that oversees LIHTC.

If you live in PUBLIC HOUSING, the local Public Housing Authority (PHA)—run by your city or county—owns your entire building and is your landlord. In rare cases, a private company may manage the building for the PHA or may be part of the ownership, but the building is still controlled by the PHA. PHAs operate in almost every city and county in California.If you live in OTHER TYPES OF FEDERAL<strong> </strong>GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, the PHA is <em>not</em><strong> </strong>your landlord. This includes all of the other types of government-assisted housing discussed on PG. 375 above. Even if you applied through the PHA, it will not be your landlord. Instead, your landlord will be a private owner who receives financial assistance from the federal government in exchange for renting to low-income people, or a private owner that accepts vouchers from low-income people who went through a PHA to get a reduction on their rent. Owners of government-assisted housing could be individual landlords, for-profit companies, or nonprofit organizations. You can get this type of government-assisted housing through VOUCHERS, where you get the assistance from a PHA and then have to find rental housing on the private market that will accept your voucher. OR you can get this type of government-assisted housing through “multifamily” properties where the owner gets the assistance and it stays with the property to keep it affordable for low-income tenants. <a id="_ednref1"></a></p><h2><a id="_Toc448153129"></a>APPLYING For &amp; GETTING INTO HOUSING</h2><h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4><ul class="learn-bullets">What it means to be eligible or ineligible for housingHow your record might ban you from private housingHow your record might ban you from government-assisted housingWhat types of bans are illegal and whenWhen a landlord is allowed to deny you housing but does not have to</ul><h1 class="subheading"><a id="HSG_understanding_eligibility"></a><a id="_Toc448153130"></a>Understanding Housing Eligibility</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153131"></a>What does it mean to be “eligible” for housing?</h3><p class="text">To be eligible for housing means you meet specific criteria so that it is <em>possible</em> for you to be accepted into that housing if you apply.

If you are low-income, it will help you in certain contexts. For example, housing that is subsidized (paid for partially or fully) by the government, you must be low-income—earning less than a certain amount of money per month—to be eligible. The income cutoff is different for different programs (read more below). But for most private housing, you must be earning more than a certain amount of money per month to be eligible. Landlords want proof of your income being a certain amount so they know you are able to pay rent. <strong>(2) CRIMINAL RECORD:</strong> For almost all kinds of housing, specific kinds of criminal convictions may disqualify you from applying, or at least make it harder for you to get accepted as a tenant.<strong>(3) OTHER SPECIFIC FACTORS:</strong> Some housing programs—especially those fully or partially funded by the government—are designed for certain specific groups of people. Your age, income level, disability status, veteran status, homeless status, gender, and whether you have children are just some of the factors that could make you eligible for certain specific housing programs.</p><h3><a id="Criminal_record_effect_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153134"></a>How will my criminal record affect my eligibility and application to different types of housing?</h3><p class="text">Whether you are looking at short-term/transitional or long-term housing, the impact of your criminal record on your application depends on whether that housing is <em>PRIVATE</em> or <em>GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED. </em>In this Chapter, when we talking about government-assisted housing, we are talking about housing that gets money from the federal government to make it more affordable for low-income people. The federal government has created many laws that control government-assisted housing, including who is allowed to live there. In this Chapter, we will explain how your CRIMINAL RECORD affects your application to both private housing and government-assisted housing; whether or not a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner can refuse to rent to you, what you can do to strengthen your application, and how you can challenge a denial that you believe is illegal.</p><p class="importantbox">HOW CAN I FIGURE OUT IF I AM APPLYING TO/LIVING IN PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING?</p><ul class="importantbox">Did you apply for the housing through a PHA?If yes, the rules and criminal record exclusions that apply to federal government-assisted housing apply to you.Do you have a “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher?

Criminal Record Bans in Private Housing</h2><h3><a id="_Toc448153137"></a>How can my criminal record affect my chances of getting private housing?</h3><p class="text">Most private landlords will run a background check on you, and have a broad discretion to deny you based on past criminal involvement. However, the landlord cannot have a blanket ban on ALL people with criminal records and must treat your criminal record the same as it treats other applicants’.

Unfortunately, the law does not protect you from housing discrimination based on your criminal record alone. Although federal and state laws make it illegal for private landlords to discriminate against you because of your <em>race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability, marital status, family status, genetic information, and source of income</em> in California, they do not provide any specific or direct protection based on having a criminal record.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1097" id="footnote-ref-1097">[1097]</a></sup></sup></span> Landlords have the power to choose their tenants, and judges often side with landlords who claim that banning people with criminal records is necessary to protect other residents and property.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1098" id="footnote-ref-1098">[1098]</a></sup></sup></span>However, there are some cases where you might be protected if a private landlord rejects you because of your criminal record. </p><ol class="text">Currently, the issue of whether private landlords who own buildings with 4 or more apartments can have a policy of refusing to rent to <em>ALL PEOPLE</em> with criminal convictions (these are called “blanket bans”) is being argued in courts.

People with disabilities enjoy greater protection against discrimination (read more about asking for a reasonable accommodation for a disability in Appendix D, PG. 453).Finally, you are protected by state and federal law that limits what a private landlord can learn about you from a BACKGROUND CHECK (often called a “tenant report” when it’s for a landlord who is screening you for their housing). A landlord has to tell you about the background check, give you a chance to fix mistakes, and certain information <em>isn’t legally supposed to come up </em>in the background check (read more on PG. 407). </ol><p class="text"><em>Continue reading for more information!</em></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153139"></a>When might I be legally protected from a private landlord discriminating against me due to my criminal record?</h3><p class="text">Below are some situations where you might be legally protected if a private landlord is discriminating on the basis of your criminal record:</p><h4 class="sidebox">What is a “BLANKET BAN” in housing?</h4><p class="sidebox">Here, a “blanket ban” means there is a policy that COMPLETELY bans or disqualifies someone—with no exceptions for any reason—from housing.</p><h5 class="numberboldblack"><a id="Blanket_ban_criminal_record"></a>Blanket Bans:</h5><p class="text">While there is no clear current law that the “blanket bans” when private landlords refuse to rent to all people with criminal convictions are unlawful, it is currently being challenged in courts because it creates a larger impact on particular races and ethnicities.

See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180 of this guide.</p><h5 class="numberboldblack">Arbitrary Discrimination: </h5><p class="text">California state law also prohibits “arbitrary discrimination,” (meaning <em>unreasonable</em> discrimination), so if a landlord has a blanket ban against anyone with criminal records—without consideration of your individual situation and ability to be a good tenant—it may be considered unreasonable, arbitrary discrimination, which is illegal.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1100" id="footnote-ref-1100">[1100]</a></sup></sup></span>If you come across a blanket ban, or discrimination that seems completely arbitrary, you should contact a lawyer.

For example, a landlord can’t reject an African-American applicant based on his/her criminal record, but then accept a white applicant with a similar criminal record. Another example is that if a private landlord conducts a background check on you, the landlord must also conduct the same background check on all other applicants. If you come across a private landlord who you believe is treating your criminal record differently from other similar applicants, this may violate your right to equal treatment under federal and state law.

However, this argument has not been fully tested in court, so it is too early to tell whether it will be successful. Lawyers in New York recently filed a lawsuit against a private landlord, arguing that the company’s blanket ban on all tenants with criminal records violates federal and state law due to its discriminatory effect on people of color, and that the company should instead give special consideration to each applicant’s situation.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1101" id="footnote-ref-1101">[1101]</a></sup></sup></span> There is also a case that is currently being heard by the United States Supreme Court that will decide if this discriminatory effect should be also prohibited.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1102" id="footnote-ref-1102">[1102]</a></sup></sup></span>In addition, California’s fair housing laws may give you slightly stronger protection in this situation, because a blanket ban against all tenants with any criminal records—regardless of the type of conviction, when it occurred, whether it affects your ability to be a good tenant (like pay rent; respect your neighbors and property; etc.), and evidence of your rehabilitation &amp; mitigating circumstances (see PG. 398 for details on evidence of rehabilitation and mitigating circumstances)—has a discriminatory effect and may not be “necessary” to protect other tenants and property.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1103" id="footnote-ref-1103">[1103]</a></sup></sup></span> </p><h5 class="numberboldblack">Past Drug or Alcohol Addiction (A Protected Disability)</h5><p class="text">It is illegal for a landlord to deny you housing based on a <em>past</em> drug or alcohol addiction, as this is a protected disability status. Past addiction, as well as current alcoholism,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1104" id="footnote-ref-1104">[1104]</a></sup></sup> are considered disabilities under both federal and state law, so landlords cannot deny you housing for this reason or even ask about past drug or alcohol abuse.

Rules for government-assisted housing can be VERY STRICT. Your local Public Housing Authority (PHA), which runs a lot of the government-assisted housing programs like Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers and the Public Housing program, and works with private owners that accept government assistance to keep their buildings more affordable, may reject you and your household because of certain criminal convictions. There are two reasons that a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing will reject you—the first is when it’s legally required (meaning the PHA and/or the owner of government-assisted housing don’t have a choice and <em>must</em> deny you), and the second is when it’s allowed but not required (meaning the PHA and/or the owner of government-assisted housing has a choice to deny you, but doesn’t <em>have</em> to). It is important for you to understand both situations, and your options to challenge the bans that are allowed, but not required, or spot situations where a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing tells you that the ban is legally required, but there is a legal loophole.

Because the law says that the rejection is required (“mandatory”), PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing do not have a choice in the matter. They must deny you if you have one of the convictions listed in the law. For all conviction-based bans that are legally required, see the chart PG. 384, and the questions on PG. 388.<strong>(2) BANS THAT ARE ALLOWED, BUT NOT REQUIRED (“CATCH-ALL” BANS):</strong> More commonly, you will likely fall into a “catch-all” ban on people with any criminal activity (which includes both arrests and convictions, even if they have been dismissed) that <em>threaten the health, safety, or right of peaceful enjoyment to the government-assisted property by the other residents, the property owner, or the PHA’s staff or agents/contractors</em>. This includes <em>drug-related criminal activity</em> and <em>violent criminal activity</em> (again, both arrests and convictions, even if dismissed, can be considered). Here, the law doesn’t require that you get denied from the housing program, but it allows PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing to deny you on this basis. </p><ul class="textbox">See the chart summarizing these bans on PG. 384, and the questions on PG. 388.

Thus, if you do not have a lifetime sex offender registration requirement, the PHA should analyze the <em>time, nature and circumstances</em> of the offense, as appropriate for any other criminal activity (see PG. 374).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1113" id="footnote-ref-1113">[1113]</a></sup></sup> As an applicant, you should also be allowed to show mitigating information and/or proof of your rehabilitation (see PG. 398 for explanations of what counts as mitigating information and proof of rehabilitation). For example, if you do not have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your lifetime, you should be able to establish that the criminal conduct was not violent, did not involve children, happened a long time ago, and that there have been no problems since the conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1114" id="footnote-ref-1114">[1114]</a></sup></sup></p><ol class="text">Go to PG. 428 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for a review hearing.Go to PG. 398 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information and proof of rehabilitation you should include with your application, and/or with any challenges you bring.If there was a MISTAKE in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention.

Because the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing is likely to run a background check on you, you should be prepared—<em>if asked</em>—to honestly disclose your criminal record <em>AND</em> to demonstrate mitigating circumstances and evidence of your rehabilitation (see PG. 398). Consider giving the PHA or owner additional information about <em>all the benefits</em> of having you join your family and how your joining may <em>positively</em> affect the stability of the entire housing development. <em>These benefits depend on the facts of your specific situation. </em>For example, you might include information about your relationship with the family members currently living in the household, especially a positive relationship with any children or a supportive relationship between you and your spouse. Another example is your potential to increase the income of the family unit already living there, so that you will stabilize the rent paid to the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing.

Letters of support and certificates of successful completion of programs that improved your life are one of the key ways can help strengthen your application to government-assisted housing!Make sure that the letters you get are detailed and really, really positive about you! A weak, impersonal letter is almost as useless as no letter at all. </p><p><strong><em>Below are some places you should consider getting letters of support or other documents proving your participation:</em></strong></p><h3 class="subheading3">evidence from SCHOOL: </h3><p class="text">Show that you stayed in school for at least 6 months and have a positive school record.</p><ol class="text">Proof could be in a transcript with good grades, or a letter from a teacher or school administrator.Our suggestion: If school administrators or teachers can say the following things truthfully, these letters should say that you:Were in school for at least six months; Had great attendance and punctuality; Had excellent grades; andAre motivated to learn and get ahead in life.  </ol><h3 class="subheading3">evidence from JOB TRAINING programs:</h3><p class="text">Show that you stayed in a job-training program for at least 6 months and have a positive record. </p><ol class="text">Proof could be through a letter from a program supervisor or administrator. Our suggestion: If true, ask your teacher or the program administrator to say that you:Participated for at least six months;Had great attendance and punctuality;Are motivated to learn and get ahead in life;Have learned useful skills to apply to a job; andGet along well with others. </ol><h3 class="subheading3">evidence of EMPLOYMENT: </h3><p class="text">Show that you kept a job for at least 6 months and had a positive work record:</p><ol class="text">Proof could be a letter from a supervisor or other person at the job. Our suggestion: These letters should not just state how long you have worked. If possible, they should also say:How well you have performed your job;Whether you have been promoted;That you have an excellent attendance record and come to work on time; andThat you are motivated, responsible, and get along well with others.If you worked while you were incarcerated and can get a good letter from a supervisor, do it! This can be useful, especially if you went above and beyond what was required by the job.  </ol><h3 class="subheading3">evidence of your participation in COUNSELING OR SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMs:</h3><p class="text">Show that you spent at least 6 months in counseling or another social service program to deal with the problem that led you into criminal behavior. If you were in drug treatment or had a drug problem, you might be required to provide a clean drug test. You also have to show that you have done well in the program.</p><ol class="text">Proof could be a letter from your counselor, therapist, or doctor.Our suggestion: These letters should do a lot more than simply state the dates you were in treatment and the fact that you completed treatment. If your counselors in social service, mental health, and/or alcohol and drug programs can say the following things truthfully, then they should also say that you:Had great attendance;Had clear drug tests for at least 12 months (and provide the test results);Showed excellent motivation and desire to change;Participated fully in programs;Got along well with others;Understand the causes of your past behaviors and are committed to positive growth;Are not a risk to the safety of others; andNo longer hang out with the same peers that got you into trouble. </ol><h3 class="subheading3">PROOF OF a DISABILITY: </h3><p class="text">If you have any type of disability that prevents you from going to school or working, then it can help to show any programs you have participated in to get support for your disability. If the disability is a past drug addiction (NOT a current one), alcoholism, or a mental health issue, it could be helpful to show at least six months of counseling, such as mental health treatment or drug or alcohol treatment.Proof of this can be your counselor’s letter explaining that you are unable to work (see above). You can also try to get any other proof of your disability, such as a letter from your doctor, saying that you cannot work or go to school because of your disability. If you are on SSI or SSDI public benefits, you can also provide proof (learn more about SSI on PG. 535, and more about SSDI on PG. 530 in the PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER). If you cannot show at least six months of counseling, work, school, or job training, then you will have a much harder time convincing the PHA to find you eligible. However, if your disability is so severe that you cannot participate in ANY of these activities (for example, you are homebound), a letter explaining this can be helpful. </p><h3 class="subheading3">Proof of expungement, dismissal, pardon, or CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION for a past conviction:</h3><p><strong>For more information about whether you qualify for some form of expungement (like a dismissal, pardon, or Certificate of Rehabilitation), and how to get these, go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</strong></p><h3 class="subheading3">OTHER HELPFUL EVIDENCE:</h3><p class="text">While PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are not as persuaded by the following types of evidence, they can still be helpful if the support letters are very detailed, very positive, and make you look like you are doing ALL YOU CAN DO to move your life in a positive direction and be a productive member of society. Consider the following other forms of helpful evidence to include in your application to government-assisted housing (OR at a hearing challenging a denial):</p><ol class="text"><strong>Certificates from programs in or after prison</strong>, like anger management and drug or alcohol treatment. Remember that any programs in prison count!<strong>Letter from your Parole or Probation Officer</strong>: Our suggestion—If your Probation or Parole Officer can say the following things truthfully, ask him/her to comment on your:Positive drug tests for at least 12 months;Positive outlook;Compliance with all the requirements of parole or probation; andExceptional motivation.<strong>Letters from clergy</strong>: Our suggestion—These letters are most helpful if they show that you volunteer and play a leadership role in your community.<strong>Letters from landlords or building superintendents</strong>. Our suggestion—Ask them to say that you:Always paid your rent on time;Respected your neighbors; and Treated the property well.<strong>Letters from neighbors</strong>: Our suggestion—They should discuss what a good neighbor you are—for example, that you are quiet, respectful, and/or helpful to the building or community. <strong>Letters from your volunteer work</strong>: Our suggestion—Have you helped out at your children’s school? At their daycare center? Have you been a mentor to a child? Helped a senior citizen? Volunteered in any other way? Get a letter saying that you:Are responsible;Have made a major contribution; and/or Are dedicated to your volunteer work.Also get a letter from anyone you have helped. Have them say what an important role you played for them. Ask the person to be specific!<strong>Letters from people you have helped</strong>: Our suggestion—It can be very moving to read a letter from someone whose life you have touched in a positive way. Have you helped someone through your church? In your neighborhood? Through work?<strong>Proof about your children’s successes</strong>: Our suggestion—If your children have done impressive things, highlight that your parenting had something to do with it. Examples of what you might give are:Letter from your child’s teacher about his/her great work or good grades, emphasizing your role in encouraging your child to do his/her best, making sure your child does his/her homework, etc.Letter from your child’s coach in sports—similar to the letter from a teacher.</ol><h5 class="question">What about getting support letters from family? </h5><p class="text">While it is always nice to have support from your family, these letters are not as helpful because the PHA and/or owner of government-assisted housing assumes that your family members would write anything to help you get the housing. You can certainly include such letters if you like, but letters from people outside your family will have a bigger impact. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153162"></a>If I can show the Public Housing Authority (PHA) that I really need the housing, will that help my application?</h3><p class="text">If you need the housing badly due to a <em>disability</em> or because you are <em>homeless</em>, you should let the PHA know, as those needs might help your application to be processed faster. Beyond these situations, however, information about how you really need the housing or the fact that you can’t afford other housing in the area won’t hurt or help you because it’s usually not enough of a reason to overcome your criminal record. If you’re not sure, you can go ahead and mention the need in the application.</p><h4 class="textbox">SPECIAL NOTE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES &amp; SPECIAL NEEDS: </h4><p class="text">If the housing unit has unique characteristics that you need, you should request that the unit be kept open while your application is being reviewed, especially if you are challenging a denial of your application. This means that the PHA or owner agrees not to rent the unit to someone else until your application is decided. You wouldn’t want to win the right to live in the unit, just to have it lost to another renter while you challenge the unlawful denial. A PHA or owner will balance such a request with the need to rent vacant units.

Credit reports also show whether past credit problems have ended in a bankruptcy or a court proceeding for failing to pay your rent on time (called an “eviction” or an “unlawful detainer” under law). A credit report shows ONLY credit information, NOT criminal history information. <em>We included some very general rules about credit reports in </em>Appendix F<em>, PG. 461 of this chapter, but these rules are only a summary.

The Voucher program’s temporary absence policy must state whether or when the family may be absent—including for imprisonment; the amount of time you are allowed to be absent for; and how to resume your housing assistance. <br />24 C.F.R. § 982.312(e).</p><p class="text">Yes.

You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG. 389 of this Chapter.<em>For most federal government-assisted housing programs</em>, the local PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing may develop rules and policies regarding temporary absences, and many do have such policies.

If that is not possible, there are legal defenses to an eviction action if it is brought against the entire family in court. This HOUSING CHAPTER does not cover eviction law and all of its defenses, so if this is your issue, you will need to contact a legal aid organization that specializes in eviction defense.

They may want to review current information to assess how you may act as a tenant, whether you will obey the lease, and whether you pose a threat to other residents, the housing development, or their staff. The PHA or owner may also need to know who is residing in the unit to calculate the amount of rent owed and/or to determine the correct family size for the specific unit.</p><p class="text">Most likely, yes. Most government-assisted housing programs, will check the members of a family every year, and some programs will require mid-year reporting as well. This process is called <em>recertification</em>. When the recertification process is happening, the PHA or owner will be checking all new household members to make sure they meet <em>all of the eligibility criteria for move-in! </em>Most PHAs and owners will check the criminal background of any NEW family members at this time. <em>They could</em> re-check the criminal background of current tenants at this time, but it’s unlikely.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1212" id="footnote-ref-1212">[1212]</a></sup></sup></span> The criminal background check on any tenant could lead to the PHA or owner threatening to evict or end the assistance to an entire household.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1213" id="footnote-ref-1213">[1213]</a></sup></sup></span> Again, this HOUSING CHAPTER does not go into eviction defense, but see PG. 1180 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help you if you are facing an eviction.</p><p><strong><em>BE PREPARED TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU SHOULD BE ACCEPTED INTO HOUSING, DESPITE YOUR RECORD.</em></strong></p><p class="text">Because the PHA or owner is likely to run a criminal background check on you, you should be prepared—<em>if asked</em>—to honestly disclose your criminal record <em>and</em> to demonstrate mitigating circumstances and evidence of your rehabilitation (see PG. 398). Consider giving the PHA or owner additional information about <em>all the benefits</em> of having you join the family and how your joining may <em>positively</em> affect the stability of the entire housing development. <em>These benefits depend on the facts of your specific situation. </em>For example, you might include information about your relationship with the family members currently living in the household, especially a positive relationship with any children or a supportive relationship between you and your spouse. Another example is your potential for increasing the income of the family members that are already living in the assisted housing unit, and therefore stabilizing the rent paid to the PHA or owner.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153208"></a>If I am being incarcerated for a new offense, does my family have to report that I moved out?</h3><p class="text">Generally, yes.<em> </em>PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing usually have policies that require family members to report when a family member moves out.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1214" id="footnote-ref-1214">[1214]</a></sup></sup></span> The family’s duty to report an absence generally depends on whether your absence is temporary, and whether you intend to continue to reside in the unit after your return. Whether or not you have to re-apply will depend on how long you are gone. Many PHAs consider you to have <em>permanently moved out</em> if you’re absent from the rental unit for <em>30 or more consecutive days</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1215" id="footnote-ref-1215">[1215]</a></sup></sup></span> Keep in mind that depending on the terms of your lease/rental agreement, the PHA may be able to evict your family for failing to report any changes in the number of people living there (called “occupants”). Therefore, even if your absence is temporary (for example, less than 30 days), your family should <em>still report</em> that you’ve temporarily moved out to the PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing unit, to avoid breaking any rules in the lease. There is a chance that if it’s just a short, temporary absence, it won’t change your family’s ability to stay in the government-assisted housing unit. BUT if know you are going to be absent from the unit for 30 or more days, then your family should declare you permanently absent, meaning that you have permanently moved out.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1216" id="footnote-ref-1216">[1216]</a></sup></sup></span> If, after your incarceration, you intend to return to the unit, you will have to re-apply and meet ALL of the eligibility requirements (see PG. 379 to understand how your criminal record could affect your being re-admitted to federal government-assisted housing). </p><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Guest_policies"></a><a id="_Toc448153209"></a>Guest Policies in Government-Assisted Housing:</h2><h3><a id="_Toc448153210"></a>I have a record and want to temporarily visit or stay overnight as a guest with my family in their government-assisted housing unit.

Below we explain the general rules for staying with family or friends as a guest in their government-assisted housing, and suggested steps to avoid putting their housing assistance at risk.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153211"></a>I have a record and want to temporarily visit or stay overnight as a guest with my family in their government-assisted housing unit.

For federal government-assisted housing, federal regulations define the term “guest” as “a person temporarily staying in the unit with the consent of a tenant.”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1217" id="footnote-ref-1217">[1217]</a></sup></sup></span>The person living in the government-assisted housing unit should not be required to register and seek prior approval for an overnight guest. The owner of the government-assisted housing should allow the tenant to host guests for a “reasonable” amount of time,<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1218" id="footnote-ref-1218">[1218]</a></sup></sup></span> which is usually 14 to 30 days, depending on the landlord’s policy.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1219" id="footnote-ref-1219">[1219]</a></sup></sup></span></p><p class="importantbox">WARNING: There might be circumstances where an individual CANNOT stay as a guest or visit the assisted property AT ALL. For example, if someone committed a criminal offense on the property, the PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing may be legally allowed to ban that person from ever returning to the property. There could also be a restriction on a person’s parole or probation that forbids them from being on the property. For this reason, you want to be careful to know the rules of that PHA or owner AND know your rules of probation or parole.</p><p><strong><em>(2) If you are planning to stay for longer than 1 night as a guest:</em></strong></p><p class="text">You want to be careful to know the rules of that PHA or owner about “Unauthorized Occupants.” There are situations where, instead of being seen as a “guest”—even if that’s what you and your family consider you to truly be—the PHA or owner might classify you as an “unauthorized occupant,” a resident living in that housing unit without permission of the PHA or owner and against the rules. Being seen as an unauthorized occupant is a big problem for many reasons:</p><ol class="text">Your income and/or assets (for example, any savings or major property you own) could affect the amount of rental assistance that your family receives. The total income might be too high for the family to qualify for any assistance at all. This could lead to your family being evicted from the unit or losing its financial assistance for the housing unit.Just by being in the apartment, you might be violating the lease or the owner’s or PHA’s guest policies and subject your family to eviction.</ol><p class="text">If you want to stay as a guest for a longer period, you need to know the PHA or owner’s time limit on the number of back-to-back days OR number of total days in a year that a guest may stay in the government-assisted housing unit and still be considered a “guest.” </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Again, find out the PHA’s and owner’s rules and do not break them. Check the lease and the PHA’s and owner’s policies. There is usually a period of time stated in the lease and/or in the PHA’s or owner’s policies that defines when a guest becomes an “unauthorized occupant.”</p><h4 class="textbox">* Special Guest Policy Rules for Specific Government-Assisted Housing Programs:<br /><em>Section 8 Vouchers and Rural Development Housing</em></h4><p class="textbox"><em>Section 8 Vouchers programs:</em> Some PHAs have established guest policies for Section 8 voucher participants, limiting the time period that persons not listed as household members can stay with a tenant.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1220" id="footnote-ref-1220">[1220]</a></sup></sup></span> PHAs should inform participants of these policies and give them an opportunity to request that anyone living there for a longer period be added to the household.<em>Rural Development (RD) programs:</em> Federal regulations require that all RD leases “include provisions that establish when a guest will be considered a member of the household and be required to be added to the tenant certification.”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1221" id="footnote-ref-1221">[1221]</a></sup></sup></span> Also, the owner of the property must post this same information in its occupancy rules.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1222" id="footnote-ref-1222">[1222]</a></sup></sup></span> That means that although there is no standard amount of time required by law, the owner still <em>must</em> <em>include</em> its guest policies in the agency-approved lease used with tenants. As with the other programs, preapproval and registration of guests should not be required and the amount of time that a tenant may have a guest should be a reasonable period. However, if the guest was a former tenant who committed a drug violation and was evicted, then the owner may require that the tenant obtain approval before the guest may visit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1223" id="footnote-ref-1223">[1223]</a></sup></sup></span></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153212"></a>If I am planning to stay as a guest with family or friends until I am added to their housing lease, what are some suggested steps I can take to make sure we are following all the guest policies?</h3><p class="text">Yes, you can try to negotiate with the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property.For example, if your family is seeking to add you to the lease—but the screening process to add you to the lease <em>TAKES LONGER</em> than the amount of time the family is allowed to have you as a guest—your family, or an advocate working on your behalf, may be able to negotiate with the housing provider at the start to extend the period of time that you are allowed to stay as a guest in that government-assisted household.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1224" id="footnote-ref-1224">[1224]</a></sup></sup></span> If your family can negotiate a policy that allows you to stay longer as their guest, this helps avoid problems later on if the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing accuses your family of exceeding the time limits for guests, in violation of their lease agreement.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153213"></a>If a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing denies my request to be added to my family or friend’s lease, who can challenge the denial And how?</h3><p class="text">Your family member (whomever is listed on the lease) can request a REVIEW HEARING (sometimes call a grievance hearing, informal review, informal hearing, or conference)!

If you are a live-in aide, your income will be <em>excluded</em> from calculating the rent for the assisted unit. However, the family that lives in the unit could request an extra bedroom for the live-in aide and then be required to pay the standard amount for the larger bedroom size.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153216"></a>Can I be someone’s live-in aide in government-assisted housing if I have criminal record?</h3><p class="text">Maybe. If you have a criminal record, you may be able to reside in a government-assisted housing unit as a <em>live-in aide</em>, but you will need to be screened (see next question).Depending on the policies of the PHA or owner, the criminal background check conducted for a live-in aide may be less strict than the one used for admitting a new tenant because a live-in aide is <em>not</em> considered a true household member.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153217"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my criminal background if I am someone’s live-in aide?</h3><p class="text">Yes. The PHA and owner can screen you for issues related to your being present in the assisted unit. Most PHAs and owners will screen live-in aides for their criminal background <em>using the same or similar criteria</em> as they use for admissions (read PG. 384 for the criminal record-related bans in federal government-housing, including which ones are <em>required</em> versus which ones are <em>allowed</em>).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1226" id="footnote-ref-1226">[1226]</a></sup></sup></span></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153218"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my credit history if I am someone’s live-in aide?</h3><p class="text">No. The <em>PHA or owner should not screen you for your credit history if you are a live-in aide. </em>Your credit history has nothing to do with the family’s ability to pay for the unit—so you should not be screened for credit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1227" id="footnote-ref-1227">[1227]</a></sup></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153219"></a>I was excluded from being someone’s live-in aide based on my criminal record.

YOU WILL ALSO WANT TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE (see PG. 398 about mitigating circumstances and proof of your rehabilitation) to prove that you should not have been denied. The PHA or owner of government-assisted housing must follow certain laws and rules when considering your past convictions and criminal history information. They may only reject you for criminal activity that <em>threatens the health, safety, or peace of other residents or staff AND the criminal activity must be “reasonably recent.” For more information on these protections, go to PG. 379.</em></p><h4 class="sidebox">Helpful Hint:</h4><p class="sidebox">Language of Notice: If there are a lot of non-English speakers served by the PHA or owner, the notice may have to be written in the language used by the applicant.

It’s tough to find lawyers who do this, but it’s worth a try. See PG 1180 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help advise you as you challenge your denial from government-assisted housing. If you cannot find a lawyer to help you, do not despair! It’s possible to do this on your own!</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153233"></a>What can I expect at the review hearing? And how can I prepare?</h3><p class="text"><strong>THE HEARING:</strong>Once I have sent in a written request for a review hearing, how can I prepare for the review hearing? At the informal hearing or review, you are going to want to show the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing that you should not have been denied the housing because of mitigating circumstances/ proof of rehabilitation (see PG. 398), a disability that requires a reasonable accommodation (see Appendix D, PG. 453), or a mistake in the criminal records that the PHA or owner used (see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1038). Before the informal hearing/review, you should:</p><ol class="text">Ask the PHA or owner for <em>all</em> documents and information regarding the denial of your housing application, including a copy of the criminal records it relied upon to deny you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1236" id="footnote-ref-1236">[1236]</a></sup></sup>Get a copy of your criminal record yourself to make sure it is correct. (For information on how to do this, see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1048). <em>Compare</em> your criminal record with the information the PHA or owner used to deny you.At the same time, you will want to work on fixing any mistakes in the records used by the PHA or owner—or showing documentation of the errors. Records often have mistakes and you shouldn’t be denied housing for an error.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1237" id="footnote-ref-1237">[1237]</a></sup></sup> (See CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1044.) This can take time, so you should act fast, and ask the PHA and/or owner of the government-assisted housing to hold the unit while you collect the documents you need.Review your application &amp; be prepared to talk about important differences. Make sure you know what you wrote on your application about your criminal record, illegal drug use, or whatever it was that made you get denied for the housing. For example, what did you say in response to the question about your convictions? What did you say about your illegal drug use? Whom did you say would live in your household? If the answer you gave on your application is not exactly the same as the answer you would give today, you must be able to explain why. If you didn’t include certain information about your criminal record in your application to the PHA or owner, you will have to explain why it was left out. Or if you said that a certain relative would be living with you who is not, you need to explain what has changed. </ol><p class="text"><strong>IMPORANT:</strong> If you were denied under a ban that is allowed but not required, then you will want to prove to the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing that there are mitigating circumstances or evidence that you have changed and rehabilitated since the time of your offense. If you were denied because of your criminal history, you should present evidence of rehabilitation to show the PHA you are <em>not</em> a threat to the health or safety of other residents, PHA staff or contractors. This includes all the letters and documents you can think of that will show how you have changed and grown since your negative conduct. You should get any of the following: letters of support.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1238" id="footnote-ref-1238">[1238]</a></sup></sup> Ask people who have supported you through reentry—like your current employer, a teacher, probation officer, social worker, neighbors, current or prior landlords, and community leaders-- to write a letter of support on your behalf.

It is <em>very different</em> from a court proceeding, and formal evidence rules do NOT apply. For example, the PHA or owner may introduce newspaper reports, police blotters, declarations or criminal records, with no one to authenticate or testify about the records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1240" id="footnote-ref-1240">[1240]</a></sup></sup> You are also allowed to bring in any evidence showing why your criminal record should not bar you from getting into the housing program.You are allowed, <em>and it’s recommended, </em>that you bring a friend or family member who can be supportive and can also be a witness to what is happening and what is said at the hearing.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153235"></a>What rights do I have in a review hearing?</h3><ol class="text"><strong>You have the right to a hearing before an impartial, unbiased hearing officer.</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1241" id="footnote-ref-1241">[1241]</a></sup></sup> That means that hearing officer should be independent, with no stake in the outcome of the hearing, and ready to hear both sides.

Even though this Chapter does not go into all of the rules and laws that govern credit check, it’s still important to understand that this is part of what most landlords will be looking at. Before you apply to ANY type of housing, you can order your own credit report to make sure that all the information is accurate and up-to-date. You can order your credit reports free once every 12 months from each of the three national credit bureaus: (1) Experian, (2) TransUnion, and (3) Equifax. To learn more, see the Federal Trade Commission’s information on Free Annual Credit Reports on its website: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/freereports/index.shtml">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/freereports/index.shtml</a> (Note: this is a trusted government website about credit reports).</p><h4>LEARN ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS/ TENANT REPORTS. </h4><p class="text">Most landlords use "tenant reports” (these are background checks specifically for the purposes of housing and renting apartments) to screen housing applicants. As discussed on PG. 407, these reports can include both credit history and non-credit information such as your criminal record; court cases related to past evictions; references from former landlords; information from local, state and national databases (such as Sex Offender registries); and more. If you learn you that the landlord is going to order a background check/tenant report on you, you could save yourself a lot of time and trouble by simply asking the landlord the name and contact information for the screening company, so that you find the tenant report yourself and make sure the information is accurate and up-to-date.</p><h4>UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES AS A RENTER. </h4><p class="text">If you live in government-assisted housing, a good place to start is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD website about renting in California: <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/states/california/renting">http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/states/california/renting</a>.Carefully review any lease or rental agreement before you sign it. Be sure that any WRITTEN agreements include VERBAL conversations you had with the landlord or property management company—so that those agreements will be legally enforceable later on. As well as general rules about rent payments, utilities, and the time period covered, a lease or rental agreement should cover anything you have discussed together: things like pets, visitors, roommates, or subletting.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1250" id="footnote-ref-1250">[1250]</a></sup></sup> If you know there is something in the lease or agreement that limits your basic legal rights, bring that up with the landlord. In California, the Department of Consumer Affairs has published a great guidebook on tenants’ rights available online at: <a href="http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf">http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf</a>.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153240"></a>What are some of my general rights as a renter in California?</h3><p class="text">GENERALLY, YOUR BASIC RIGHTS AS A TENANT IN CALIFORNIA (NO MATTER WHAT THE LEASE OR RENTAL AGREEMENTS SAYS) INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:</p><ol class="text">Limits on the amount of the security deposit that the landlord can require you to pay.Limits on the landlord’s right to enter the rental unit.The right to a refund of the security deposit, or a written accounting of how it was used, after you move.The right to sue the landlord for violations of the law or your rental agreement or lease.The right to repair serious defects in the rental unit and to deduct certain repair costs from the rent, under appropriate circumstances.The right to withhold rent under appropriate circumstances.Rights under the warranty of habitability.Protection against retaliatory eviction.These and other rights will be discussed throughout the rest of this booklet.</ol><h4>KEEP RECORDS OF YOUR LEASE &amp; OTHER DOCUMENTS related to YOUR APARTMENT.</h4><p class="text">Keep a file with your signed lease or rental agreement and any other important documents. The file should include notes of any conversations you have with your landlord or apartment manager regarding repairs, disturbances, disputes, or any other event or incident that may affect your rights as a tenant. It should also include any mail, emails, repair orders, and even notes left on your door. Keep and maintain a separate file for each rental unit you live in.</p><h4>AVOID SCAMS. </h4><p class="text">Avoid rental scams by recognizing warning signs. Online resources such as Craigslist (<a href="http://www.craigslist.com">www.craigslist.com</a>) are a popular way to search for available rental units. However, scammers also use these sites to place phony rental listings or to hijack a valid listing to attempt to steal your money or identity. If you are asked to wire money—it’s probably a scam! If you are asked to pay a security deposit or an advance on your rent <em>before signing a rental agreement</em>, that is a red flag too. You should also be aware of <em>foreclosure scams</em> targeting unsuspecting renters and upset homeowners. To learn how to spot and avoid foreclosure scams, check out the following website: <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/news/blog/joan_ferenczy/20121008_fraudsters_falsely_advertising_reo_as_rentals.html">http://www.freddiemac.com/news/blog/joan_ferenczy/20121008_fraudsters_falsely_advertising_reo_as_rentals.html</a>.</p><h4>REVIEW ALL NOTICES YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR LANDLORD OR RENTAL AGENCY. </h4><p class="text">Small problems can become big problems if you ignore them. A landlord’s notice to evict you may give you only a certain number of days to respond. If you do not respond within the given time, the landlord may seek a court order to evict you. Notice of court actions give only a certain number of days to respond! If you have questions about what a notice means, see the list of housing legal aid providers on PG. 1180 to try and speak to a lawyer who may be able to help you.</p><h4>KNOW WHERE TO COMPLAIN OR SEEK HELP IF PROBLEMS COME UP. </h4><p class="text">Understand that no single law covers all rental situations. And no single federal, state, or local government agency has the ability or authority to investigate every type of problem you might encounter. This guide suggests ways you might make a complaint or challenge a discriminatory act based on your criminal record. But also know that sometimes, private landlords <em>are allowed</em> to make decisions on the basis of your criminal conviction history.

In California, all legitimate and lawful sources of income must be considered the same by a housing provider—they can’t discriminate. Cal. Gov’t Code § 12955(p)(2). For example, your Social Security disability income (SSI/SSDI) should have the same weight in evaluating your income than wages from an office job—a landlord must treat these the same.</p><p class="text">A rental application may require you to provide any of the following information:</p><ol class="text">Current and past addresses of where you have lived, your employers, your personal references, and your previous/current landlords.Your Social Security Number (SSN) and Driver’s License or State ID number.

The fancy legal term for an eviction lawsuit is an “unlawful detainer” action. It is called “unlawful detainer” because the landlord is accusing the tenant of staying in a rental unit when he or she does not have a legal right to do so, therefore, the rental unit is unlawfully detained. To “be evicted” means (1) you were the defendant (the renter who is being accused of unlawfully staying in the rental unit) in this type of lawsuit, (2) you lost the lawsuit, and (3) the court then ordered you to move out of the apartment or rental unit. If you leave a rental unit because the landlord asks you to do so, but you are never served with “unlawful detainer” eviction court papers, then you have not been evicted in the legal sense of the word.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1254" id="footnote-ref-1254">[1254]</a></sup></sup></span></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153243"></a>I am facing an eviction.

Can I be evicted because of this notice?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1255" id="footnote-ref-1255">[1255]</a></sup></strong></h3><p class="text">There are different kinds of “3-Day” notices. Most 3-Day notices can be corrected without having to actually move out of your apartment or home. The most common is the 3-Day notice “to pay rent or quit.” A landlord can give other kinds of 3-Day notices, as well. Another common one is the notice that says the tenant (the person living in the apartment who is on the lease) has created a nuisance or has done something which is not allowed under the rules of the lease agreement. All of these notices must be <em>in writing.</em></p><h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO “PAY RENT OR QUIT”:</h4><p class="text">If your rent is late or not paid in full, the landlord may give you a notice called a “Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.” The landlord cannot give you this notice until the rent is late. This notice must be in writing.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153245"></a>What must a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit” say?</h3><p><strong>Under law, the notice must state:</strong></p><ol class="text">The exact amount of rent you owe (generally, this may NOT include late charges or other fees, although some courts have allowed late charges to be included);That you have a choice of paying the rent or MOVING OUT (“Quit” is the legal term for moving out);Your correct address;The name, address and telephone number of the person you are supposed to pay the rent to; ANDIf you are allowed to pay rent in person, the usual days and hours the person receiving the rent will be available. <em>Note:</em> If there is some other way you are supposed to pay rent, the landlord may have to explain that to you.</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153246"></a>What are my options if I get a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit”?</h3><p class="text">To figure out when the third day is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to pay or move. (1) <strong>One choice</strong> is that you can move out during the 3 days. If you move out at this time, technically, the landlord CANNOT file a court eviction against you. However, some landlords try to do so anyway. If this happens, you should call a legal aid office immediately; see a list of legal aid providers across California on PG. 1180 that may be able to assist you.</p><p><strong>Also, even if you move out within the 3 days, the landlord can later sue you for past rent due. Most landlords will not bother with this.</strong></p><p class="text">(2) <strong>Another choice</strong> is to pay the rent. If you decide to pay, you should pay the ENTIRE AMOUNT that the notice asks for, before the three days are up. Make sure that you get a receipt. If you cannot pay the full amount, you may be better off not paying anything —unless you can agree on a payment schedule with the landlord. If you reach such an agreement, make sure it is in writing and keep a copy of the agreement.If you offer the full amount asked for within the 3 days, the landlord MUST ACCEPT the money from you. If you think the landlord might refuse your money, take along a friend to be a witness just in case. After the 3 days, the landlord does not have to accept any money from you. If you decide to try to pay the landlord even though the 3 days are up, you should get a RECEIPT and ask the landlord to agree IN WRITING not to evict you. If the landlord refuses to agree to that, the landlord may still try to evict you.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153247"></a>What could happen if I do not pay my rent or do not move within the 3 days?</h3><p class="text">The landlord must go to court to evict you.After the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The 3-Day notice is only the <em>first step</em> in the eviction process. The landlord must go to court and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see PG. 435.</p><h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO PERFORM COVENANT(S) OR QUIT</h4><p class="text">Sometimes this kind of notice is called “3-Day Notice to Perform or Quit.” The landlord will give you this notice if s/he believes that you did something OR failed to do something that violated your lease or rental agreement. Some examples include, if you did not pick up trash around your place, if you took in pets when they are not allowed, or if you left a junk car in the parking lot. This notice must be IN WRITING.After you get this notice, you have 3 days to fix the problem or move out.To figure out when the last day to fix the problem or move out is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to correct the problem. If you do not fix the problem and if you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, after the three days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The landlord must file court papers and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see PG. 435.If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of breaking the lease, you should write to your landlord explaining your side of the story. Make sure to date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. Make a copy of it to keep for your records.If you already have broken the lease or rental agreement but now you agree to obey it, you should write a letter to the landlord. Tell him or her that you have done what the notice requested and that you will obey the lease agreement from now on. Sign and date the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. Keep a copy for your records.</p><h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO QUIT</h4><p class="text">This kind of notice orders you to move because you have done something that the landlord believes cannot be corrected. This is the most serious notice your landlord can give you. For example, you may get this kind of notice if you have done illegal things (such as using or dealing drugs) on the property. This notice does not give you the chance to correct what was done. This notice means your landlord just wants you to move out. This notice must be in writing.If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of doing something that you did not do, you should write to your landlord immediately and state that you did not do what you are accused of doing. Make sure you date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. You must also keep a copy of the letter for your records.If you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, as with other eviction notices, after the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply kick you out without a court order.</p><h4>SERVICE OF THE 3-DAY NOTICE</h4><p class="text"> The law states that you must be given a 3-Day Notice in writing. The courts are not always strict about how the landlord gives the 3-Day Notice to you. However, the law says that the landlord must give the notice to in one of the following ways:</p><ol class="text"><strong>Personal Service</strong> — by handing you a copy.<strong>Substituted Service</strong> — if you are not home or at your usual workplace, a copy can be left at either place with a person who is old enough to understand the importance of the 3-Day Notice. A copy of the notice must also be mailed to you. Keep the envelope in which the notice was mailed.<strong>“Nail and Mail”</strong> — if the landlord cannot do either of the above, a copy of the 3-Day Notice can be posted on your property in a place that you will find it. A copy of the notice must also be mailed to you. </ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153248"></a>What could happen if my landlord takes me to court to evict me?</h3><p class="text">If the landlord takes you to court to evict you, you will get legal papers called a “Summons” and a “Complaint.” Make a note of what day you receive these papers. You have 5 days from the day you receive the Summons and Complaint to respond to the court. To count the 5 days: start counting with the day after you received the papers. You must count Saturdays and Sundays, but do not count court holidays. If the 5<sup>th</sup> day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, you will have until the end of the next court business day to “answer” these papers. <em>Example: Jane gets the Summons and Complaint papers on a Monday. Tuesday is the first day of the 5 days. The 5th day would be a Saturday. Jane has until the next business day, Monday, to file her papers. If Monday is a holiday, Jane has until Tuesday. </em>If you want to fight the eviction, you should contact a legal aid lawyer immediately. Do NOT wait until the fifth day to call!! If you wait until the last minute, they may not be able to help you.Within those 5 days, you can file a written response to the landlord’s summons and complaint. You must use the right legal form and file it in the same court where the “Complaint” was filed. This form is called an “Answer.” If you are low-income and file a separate form called an “Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs,” you will probably not need to pay the court filing fees. You can get both the Answer and the Fee Waiver forms at the court clerk’s office.When you fill out the Answer, you will need to list any legal defenses to the eviction. After you file the Answer, you will receive a “Memorandum to Set Case for Trial” and a notice of the trial date by mail. Generally, the trial must be within 20 days of when the landlord files the “Memorandum to Set Case for Trial.” The court clerk must mail you the notice telling you when the trial will be at least ten days before the trial. When your court date comes up, plan to arrive early at the courthouse so that you can find parking, get through the security check, and find the courtroom. If you are late and the judge has already called your case, you will lose your case.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153249"></a>What could happen if I ignore the summons and complaint and do nothing?</h3><p class="text">After the five days are up, if you have not filed an Answer to challenge the eviction, the landlord can ask the court clerk for a “default judgment.” If this happens, you will NOT go before a judge. This means that the landlord automatically wins the case and gets the property back from you.Sometimes the court will allow you to “re-open” the case after entering a “default judgment” if you have a good reason for not filing the Answer on time. If this happens to you, contact a legal aid organization and ask for assistance with a default eviction.<strong>NOTE:</strong> You should not assume that the court will allow you to “re-open” your case. In many cases, the tenant’s request is denied. Therefore, you must try to file your Answer within the 5 days so that you do not lose your case by missing a legal deadline.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153250"></a>What could happen if I lose in court or after a judgment against me?</h3><p class="text">If the landlord wins or gets a default judgment against you, the landlord will get a form called a “Writ of Possession.” The landlord takes this writ to the Sheriff’s Department who will then bring you (or post on your door) a “Notice to Vacate.” The notice will give you at least 5 days before the officer will come back to evict you. The Notice to Vacate will tell you exactly by what date and time you must be out of the house or apartment. Even if you are not completely moved out, the sheriff can prevent you from re-entering the house to get your stuff after the time and date listed on the notice. If you cannot get all of your belongings out in time, at least remove your important papers, medications, valuables, and clothing. If you leave things behind, you can claim them within 15 days of the eviction, but you will have to pay the storage and removal costs. However, the landlord cannot require you to pay back rent, attorney’s fees or court costs in order to get your belongings back. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153251"></a>How long does the eviction process take?</h3><p class="text">If you do not file an “Answer” to the eviction notice, the sheriff may be out to evict you as soon as 11 days after you receive the <em>Summons</em> and <em>Complaint</em>. If you file an Answer to the lawsuit, the process will take a little longer. Do not expect the entire process to take more than 1 month—it could take even less than 1 month. Contrary to some popular belief, you can be evicted if even if you are pregnant, have small children, have an unexpected financial hardship (like losing your job), if you’ve never been late with the rent before or if you have nowhere else to move.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153252"></a>I live in transitional housing, and the housing provider (or parole) IS trying to evict me with very little notice &amp; without going to court. Is this legal &amp; what are my options?</h3><p class="text">In most cases, a transitional housing provider MUST follow all of the normal rules and laws to evict you. That means they must follow all of the rules for giving you proper notice and taking you to court if they want to evict you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1256" id="footnote-ref-1256">[1256]</a></sup></sup></span>** There is one <em>VERY SMALL EXCEPTION</em> that could allow a transitional housing provider to evict you more quickly than the standard court process. However, for this exception to apply, it must be <em>explicitly</em> written in the contract you signed with the transitional housing provider. There are other requirements beyond that, but at a minimum, if it’s not in your contract with the transitional housing provider, then the transitional housing provider can’t evict you overnight, with little notice, or without first going to court.If this issue is a condition of your supervision (a requirement of parole or probation), see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130, to learn more about rules (called “conditions”) of different types of supervision in California, and how to challenge them.</p><h2><a id="_Toc448153253"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p class="text">Where you live is critical to your well-being. Unfortunately, it can also be one of the most challenging aspects of reentry. Hopefully, this Chapter has helped you understand your housing options, and given you the tools to help you to find appropriate housing and recognize illegal discrimination when it occurs.</p><p class="appendixtocheading"><a id="CHAPTER_HS_APPENDIXTOC"></a><a id="_Toc448153254"></a>HOUSING APPENDIX</p><div class="appendixlist">A List of PHAs in California and their Contact Information – PG. 442A list of transitional housing that may accept your application while you are still incarcerated – PG. 448NHLP chart—federally assisted housing programs: admissions for applicants with certain criminal backgrounds – PG. 450Disabilities &amp; Requesting Reasonable Accommodations on Any Housing Application – PG. 453Sample Consent Form that Your Drug or Alcohol Treatment Program Could Use to Disclose Information About Your Treatment – PG. 459Housing Owners’/ Landlords’ Access to Credit Reports – PG. 461San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance – PG. 462Filing a Complaint for Illegal Discrimination in Private Housing – PG. 466Rural development (RD) grievance procedures – PG. 473Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA) – PG. 474</div><div class="appendix"><a id="HS_App_A_PHAs"></a>APPENDIX A</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppA"></a>A List of PHAs in California and their Contact Information</div><table><tr><td><p><strong>PHA Name, Phone &amp; Fax Number</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Address</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Type (Section 8, low-rent, or both)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:hainfo@alamedahsg.org">Alameda City </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (510) 747-4300</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (510) 522-7848</p></td><td><p>701 Atlantic Ave. </p><p><strong>Alameda</strong></p><p>CA 94501</p></td><td><p>Both</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:sean.rogan@lacdc.org">Los Angeles County (HACOLA) </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (323) 890-7400</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (323) 890-8582</p></td><td><p>700 W Main St.</p><p><strong>Alhambra</strong></p><p>CA 91801</p></td><td><p>Both</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:GStepter@anaheim.net">Anaheim Housing Authority </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (714) 765-4320</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (714) 765-4654</p></td><td><p>201 S Anaheim Blvd #200 </p><p><strong>Anaheim</strong></p><p>CA 92805</p></td><td><p>Section 8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:ndempsey@placer.ca.gov">Placer County Housing Authority </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (530) 889-7692</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (530) 889-6826</p></td><td><p>11552 B Ave. </p><p><strong>Auburn</strong></p><p>CA 95603</p></td><td><p>Section 8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:cmoyes@kernha.org">Kern County </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (661) 631-8500</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (661) 631-9500</p></td><td><p>601 - 24th St. </p><p><strong>Bakersfield</strong></p><p>CA 93301</p></td><td><p>Both</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:SRuelas@baldwinpark.com">Baldwin Park </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (626) 960-4011</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (626) 337-2965</p></td><td><p>14403 Pacific Ave. </p><p><strong>Baldwin Park</strong></p><p>CA 91706</p></td><td><p>Both</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.hud.gov/utilities/intercept.cfm?mailto:Wlowell@smchousing.org">San Mateo County </a></p><p><strong>Phone:</strong> (650) 802-3300</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> (650) 802-3373</p></td><td><p>264 Harbor Boulevard Bldn.

For example, the city of San Francisco, CA has a new law called the “Fair Chance Ordinance” that adds additional protections for people with criminal records who apply to live in <em>city-funded affordable housing</em> (which includes Below Market Rate or “BMR” units in private buildings in SF). Go to Appendix H, PG. 466 for information on the San Francisco law and the process of filing a complaint against a landlord or housing provider who has violated the law in San Francisco.</p><div class="appendix"> <a id="HS_App_I_RD_grievance_procedures"></a>APPENDIX I</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppI"></a>Rural development (RD) grievance procedures </div><p class="text">The grievance procedures for Rural Development (RD) housing are different from most other government-assisted housing programs. Here is an overview of how it works if you live in RD housing:</p><ol class="text">When a grievance is filed, regulations require the owner of the multifamily property (or owner’s representative) to offer to meet informally with the denied applicant within 10 calendar days to resolve the grievance. If the informal meeting fails to resolve the issue, the owner must file a report summarizing the problem to USDA (DEFINE THIS) and the applicant.The applicant (you) may submit a summary of the problem to USDA. After you get a summary of the problem, you must file a written request for an informal review hearing within 10 calendar days.After you request the informal review hearing, a hearing panel will be selected.You and the owner of the multifamily property may agree on a hearing officer, <em>or</em> you may each appoint one member of a 3-person panel, and those two hearing officers choose the third officer. If you and the owner <em>cannot agree within 30 days </em>on the two hearing officers, USDA will give you notice and appoint a person to act as the sole hearing officer.A USDA-approved ‘Standing Hearing Panel’ can also hear all grievances related to a particular development, where at least one member of the standing hearing panel must be selected by the residents at a formal resident meeting called to select hearing panel members.After the hearing panel is selected, the hearing will be scheduled within 15 days.</ol><div class="appendix"><a id="HS_App_J_THPMA"></a>APPENDIX J</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_THPMA"></a>Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)</div><p class="text">It is very common to live in a transitional housing program after release from prison or jail. As described on PG. 365, transitional housing programs are <em>temporary</em> programs that offer <em>temporary</em> housing and services. They usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. Some transitional housing programs offer services like job training, counseling, GED programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are intended for people with specific needs such as mental illness, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 373), disabilities (PG. 453), or domestic violence support (see PG. 368).In this section, we explain a special law called the Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA). Just because you live in transitional housing does NOT mean that the THPMA applies to you, <em>so read carefully!</em></p><div class="questionheading">HOW CAN A transitional HOUSING PROVIDER REMOVE ME FROM MY HOUSING?</div><p class="text">AS A <a id="Formal_eviction_general_rule"></a>GENERAL RULE: If a resident and a transitional housing provider have an agreement for that person to live in the housing unit, the transitional housing provider MUST follow California’s formal eviction process in civil court (these cases are called “unlawful detainer” actions under the law). If a transitional housing provider removes you <em>without going through the formal court process</em>, that housing provider could be subject to legal liability. If possible, talk to an lawyer or advocate at a legal aid organization about your rights (see a list of legal aid organizations across California, beginning on PG. 1180).</p><p><strong>EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE—THE THPMA:</strong></p><p>The THPMA is a California state law and says owners of transitional housing can evict you more quickly than a normal eviction procedure ONLY IF the following 3 requirements are met:</p><ol class="text">You committed “participant misconduct or abuse”; 	You have lived in the transitional housing program for less than 6 months; ANDYou signed a WRITTEN CONTRACT with the transitional housing provider when entering the program that explicitly stated that the THPMA applied, with information about your rights and the procedure for using the THPMA to kick someone out more quickly.</ol><p><strong>WHAT IS A “TENANT”?</strong></p><p class="sidebox">A tenant is a person who lives on land or in a property that is rented from a landlord.</p><p>ALL of these factors need to be true, and most of the time, they are not, so REMEMBER—generally you have the same rights as a <em>tenant</em> facing eviction, which means usually a transitional housing provider has to go through the court process to evict (remove) you.</p><div class="questionheading">WHAT IS considered A “<em>TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM</em>” UNDER THE THPMA?</div><p>Under the THPMA, a transitional housing program is <em>any </em>program designed to assist homeless persons to live independently in permanent housing with <em>all</em> the following components:</p><ol class="text">Residency requirements from 30 days to 24 months.Provides comprehensive social service programs incl. individualized case mgt. and may include other services such as alcohol/substance abuse counseling, self-improvement training, employment and training, and living skills.Provides temporary housing with structured setting and rules participants need to comply with to remain in program.</ol><p class="textbox">KEY DEFINITION: “Homeless person” = This law defines a homeless person as an individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate place to sleep at night, <em>or</em> lived in any temporary housing, shelter, or institution, which includes sites not ordinarily used or designed for regular sleeping. This definition also covers <em>any person living with</em> the transitional housing program participant.</p><div class="questionheading"><em>WHEN</em> MAY A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS AND EVICT me MORE QUICKLY THAN the normal eviction process?</div><p class="text">An operator may use the faster, expedited THPMA restraining order/injunction process only for (1) program misconduct, or (2) abuse, defined below.</p><ol class="text">Program misconduct—is an <em>intentional</em> violation of the transitional housing program’s rules and regulations. The intentional violation <em>must</em> “substantially interfere with the orderly operation of the program,” <em>and</em> involve one of the following acts:Drunkenness on site; Unlawful use or sale of drugs; Theft; Arson; Destruction of property (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site); orViolence or threat of violence and harassment (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).</ol><p><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p><ol class="text"><a id="THPMA_Abuse"></a>Abuse—is <em>intentionally or recklessly causing, or attempting to cause</em>, bodily injury or sexual assault; <em>or </em>placing someone else in reasonable fear of “imminent serious bodily injury” (against yourself, the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).<em>Even in these situations, the transitional housing provider</em> may NOT use the expedited THPMA removal process against a participant in the program<em> for 6 months or more, UNLESS </em>a restraining order (permanent injunction) or temporary restraining order (TRO) is already pending or in force against you. If the operator hasn’t started a THPMA action within 6 months of your participation in the program, then the operator must either (1) go through the form eviction (“unlawful detainer”) court process, and/or (2) use a traditional civil harassment restraining order process to remove you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1327" id="footnote-ref-1327">[1327]</a></sup></sup></span></ol><div class="questionheading">HOW could A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS?</div><p class="text">If the above requirements are all met, a transitional housing program operator may:</p><ol class="text">Use the formal eviction/”unlawful detainer” court process (see the GENERAL RULE on PG. 474—the THPMA gives the transitional housing owner two options for evicting someone); <em>OR</em>If program misconduct or abuse: Use the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)/injunction process under the THPMA.</ol><div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE TRO PROCESS?</div><p class="text">The TRO process is a 2-step process:<strong>STEP 1:</strong> The transitional housing program operator must file an application for an <em>immediate temporary restraining order</em> (TRO) until a hearing can take place. This immediate TRO may include orders that you (the program participant) refrain from misconduct, <em>or</em> it may exclude you from participating and living at the transitional housing program site, and stay at least 200 feet away from the site of <em>abuse </em>(defined above, PG. 475) was alleged.<strong>STEP 2:</strong> There is a <em>hearing on permanent injunction</em>—usually within in 5 days of the program operator filing the TRO. For the judge to issue a permanent injunction (permanent restraining order) at the hearing, there must be <em>clear and convincing evidence</em> of program misconduct or abuse by the participant.</p><div class="questionheading">WHAT ARE “STAY AWAY” AND “EXCLUSION” ORDERS, AND WHEN CAN A PROGRAM OPERATOR GET ONE AGAINST ME?</div><p class="text">These types of orders are defined below:</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Exclusion Order:</span> An<em> exclusion order</em> says that you are not allowed to participate or live at the program site.<span class="emphasisitalic">Stay Away Order:</span> A stay away order says that you cannot be within 200 feet of the transitional housing program site or other program sites that it runs.</ol><p class="text">A transitional housing program operator may only ask for exclusion and stay away orders for “abuse,” NOT for “program misconduct” (defined above on PG. 475). These orders can last for up to <em>1 year after the hearing</em>, and the operator can ask the court to renew the restraining order after that (<em>NOTE:</em> the operator must ask for an extension of the exclusion or stay away order at least 3 months before the original one expires). The program operator may also be able to get an <em>immediate</em> exclusion or stay away order from the court in a temporary restraining order (TRO) hearing—but only if it’s an <em>emergency. </em>It can only be considered an emergency if it’s <em>necessary to protect</em> another participant, employee, or person living within 100 feet of the program site from “imminent serious bodily injury.”</p><div class="questionheading">WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR GETS AN EXCLUSION OR “STAY AWAY” ORDER?</div><p class="text"><em>Before the hearing, through a TRO,</em> the transitional housing program operator may have you immediately removed from the unit.<em>After the hearing,</em> the transitional housing program operator may take immediate possession of the unit and consider it “abandoned.” If there are other people living in the unit (for example, your family members), but those other people were not named in the restraining order petition, then the program operator may <em>only remove you, and anyone actually named in the petition.</em> A copy of the order will also be given to the local police.</p><div class="questionheading">WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR <em>DOESN’T</em> GET AN EXCLUSION OR STAY AWAY ORDER?</div><p class="text">If you violate the conditions of the restraining order (also called a permanent injunction), the transitional housing program operator may:</p><ol class="text">Serve you with a 3-day “notice to quit”—meaning you have 3 days to get you and your belongings out of the transitional housing program; and after the 3 days are up, the operator can start a formal eviction process in court (an “unlawful detainer’ action – learn more about these eviction lawsuits on PG. 435 above).File a “contempt” action in court along with a request (called a “petition”) to modify the exiting restraining order to <em>include an exclusion order</em> (EVEN IF the original action was based only on “program misconduct”),Finally, if you “willfully disobey” the court’s restraining order, you could be charged and possibly convicted of a criminal misdemeanor.Below, we have copied the instructions from the California Courts for someone who is participating in a transitional housing program covered by the THPMA and who receives restraining order papers.<em> </em></ol><p><em>You can download all forms related to the THPMA on the California Superior Court’s website at </em><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH">http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH</a>.</p><div class="questionheading">What STEPS does THE CALIFORNIA COURT suggest I TAKE IF YOU I’m being KICKED OUT OF TRANSITIONAL HOUSING UNDER THE Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)?</div><p class="text">The California Courts have published instructions for people who are facing removal from transitional housing under the THMPA. Those instructions are available on court form TH-210, available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf</a>, and also copied below for your reference.1. <strong>Legal advice.</strong> If you are served with an Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order ["OSC/TRO"] and a Petition, you should seek legal advice right away. The OSC/TRO should list the name, address, and phone number of the Legal Services Office in the county where the petition is filed. You may be able to get legal services by contacting this office. If you do not have an attorney, you can also call the attorney's referral service of your local bar association for help.2. <strong>Read the Instructions.</strong> Whether or not you choose to talk to an attorney, you should read all of these instructions and the other papers you have received.3. <strong>Obey the Order.</strong> Read the papers served on you very carefully. The Petition tells you what orders the program opera- tor is asking the court to make. The OSC/TRO tells you when to appear in court and may contain a temporary order telling you that you cannot do certain things. YOU HAVE TO OBEY THE ORDER. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE COURT'S ORDERS, CRIMINAL CHARGES MAY BE FILED AGAINST YOU. IF YOU ARE FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF COURT FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE COURT'S ORDERS, THE COURT CAN CHANGE THE ORDERS TO FORCE YOU TO MOVE OUT OF THE PROGRAM'S HOUSING.4. <strong>Review the facts.</strong> Read the description of the facts on the Petition very carefully. This is where the program operator tells the judge what he or she thinks happened. If you do not agree with the facts on the petition or you think it would not be fair for the court to grant orders against you, GO TO THE HEARING. The place and time of the hearing are on the first page of the form named "Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order."5. <strong>Respond to the court.</strong> If you want to fight the petition you should file a Participant's Response. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO FILE THIS FORM. A blank copy of the Response should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO. You can also file and serve statements signed by people who have personal knowledge of the facts. These are called "declarations." You can type these declarations on form MC-031 and attach them to your Response. If you do not know how to prepare a declaration, you should see an attorney.6. <strong>Serve a copy on program operator.</strong> After you have filed the Participant's Response with the superior court clerk, a copy must be delivered personally or by mail to the program operator or the program operator's attorney.You cannot serve the program operator yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process server, the sheriff's department, or any person 18 years of age or older, other than you. The person should complete and sign a Proof of Personal Service form. (A blank copy should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO.) You should take the completed form back to the court clerk or bring it with you to the hearing.7. <strong>Extensions.</strong> If you need more time to find an attorney or to prepare your Response, you must ask the judge for a continuance (extension) by the hearing date shown on the OSC/TRO.8. <strong>Opposing the Petition.</strong> If you wish to fight the lawsuit, you should file a Participant's Response and also go to the hearing. If you have any witnesses, they also must be present. If you do not attend the hearing, the court may make "permanent" orders against you that will last up to one year. If you can't file and serve a Response (or find an attorney who will), SHOW UP AT THE HEARING ANYWAY. At the hearing, explain your difficulties to the judge, and ask to be allowed to tell your side of the case.</p><p><a id="CHAPTER5_PB"></a></p><h1><a id="_Ref292955197"></a>PUBLIC BENEFITS</h1><p><img src="74.png" /></p><p><strong>This PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER will give you an overview of the public benefits (government assistance) available to you in reentry, including how a criminal record affects your application.

Public benefits are also sometimes referred to as “welfare,” or “welfare benefits.” There are public benefits programs to help people get food, shelter, healthcare, childcare, cash for day-to-day expenses, and support in emergencies. To qualify for any public benefits program, you have to meet certain requirements. Each benefits program works a little differently and has different rules and requirements in place. Depending on your situation, you may qualify for several kinds of public benefits, just one, or none. This section explains what the main public benefits programs offer, which ones you may qualify for, and how to get them.<sup><a href="#footnote-1328" id="footnote-ref-1328">[1328]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc290125847"></a><a id="_Toc448153257"></a>What should I know about federal, state, and county benefits?</h3><p class="text">The federal (national) government is in charge of certain public benefits programs that operate across the country; and the state and county governments are in charge of others that are specific to their own residents:</p><ol class="text">For some benefits programs, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), the federal government sets all the rules about who can receive benefits and how they get issued, requiring agencies in every state and county to follow those rules when distributing those benefits. For example: If you are a person with a disability and no income, and you want to apply for SSI benefits, you have to follow the same rules and meet the same requirements no matter what state or county you live in.For other benefits programs, such as cash assistance, the federal government sets only very general rules, allowing state and county governments to set up their own systems for distributing those benefits to their residents. For example, if you’re a California resident struggling to cover your living costs and want to apply for cash aid through the General Assistance or General Relief (GA/GR) programs, the rules are set by California and your specific county.<sup><a href="#footnote-1329" id="footnote-ref-1329">[1329]</a></sup>For other benefits programs, such as healthcare, the federal government sets up a general system for low-income people (Medicaid) and requires agencies in every state and county to follow those national rules—but also allows states and counties to set more specific rules for their residents and run their own benefits programs for residents who don’t qualify under the federal rules.<sup><a href="#footnote-1330" id="footnote-ref-1330">[1330]</a></sup> </ol><p class="text">It is important to know what government agency runs your public benefits—who sets the program rules, as well as which agency you apply and report to.</p><p class="widetableintroitalcaps">This chart describes the most common types of public benefits programs, and what they can provide to people who qualify.

You can even apply for certain benefits while you are still in prison or jail. But with other benefits programs, there are rules that may disqualify you based on your criminal history. Some programs may limit or deny your access to benefits if you have a certain kind of criminal conviction (a criminal offense you were found guilty of); a parole/probation violation; certain kinds of unpaid fines, fees or debts; or an outstanding warrant. Different programs will have different rules and requirements about these issues. Some programs also impose different restrictions based on what your conviction or violation was, how long ago it was, and how many other convictions or violations you have had.</p><h3><a id="_Toc290125849"></a><a id="_Toc448153259"></a>Can I apply for public benefits while I’m incarcerated?</h3><p class="text">It depends.

Either you or your AR may sign the application forms. The AR is designated in writing by the head of the household. The AR must sign the form “Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Request for Designated Alternate Cardholder/Authorized Representative” (CSF 64 form) and the benefits will be assigned to the facility, not to the resident (see sample CSF 64 form in Appendix B, PG. 558).<sup><a href="#footnote-1384" id="footnote-ref-1384">[1384]</a></sup> </ul><a id="_Toc290125875"></a><a id="_Toc448153285"></a><h3>Once I’m enrolled in CalFresh, what rules must I follow to stay eligible? </h3><h4 class="sidebox">EXCEPTIONS TO WORK REQUIREMENT</h4><p class="sidebox">Certain people are exempt (excused) from these work requirements.

An LSA is a county that, during the last two years, has had an unemployment rate of 20% or more above the national average. Right now, all counties are expected to be listed as LSAs until December 2016. Additionally, if you are employed, but choose to leave your job, and apply for or receive CalFresh benefits, you can’t get CalFresh for 3 months.<em>Report Requirements:</em> Most CalFresh households must submit a report, called a Semi-Annual Income Eligibility Report (SAR 7) every six months.<sup><a href="#footnote-1387" id="footnote-ref-1387">[1387]</a></sup> Additionally, they must immediately report a change in address, any changes in employment, changes in people who live with the family, and anytime their income goes over the Interim Report Threshold. Failure to report within the time limits could result in an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) (IPVs explained on PG. 497).<em>Recertification requirements:</em> When you first enroll in CalFresh, your enrollment will only last for a limited time called a “certification period.” This is usually one year, but in some cases it’s only a few months. If you want to get CalFresh for longer than that, then before this period ends, you must apply for recertification—that is, prove that you’re still eligible for CalFresh. Before the first day of the last month of your certification period, the county should send you a “Notice of Expiration” (NOE) that says when, where, and how to apply for recertification. If your certification period is 1-2 months, the county must give you a NOE at the start of your certification period.<sup><a href="#footnote-1388" id="footnote-ref-1388">[1388]</a></sup></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: To keep getting CalFresh without interruption, apply for recertification on or before the 15th day of the last month of your certification period; For example, if your 1-year certification period runs April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, you must recertify BEFORE March 15, 2015. Please note: If your certification period has expired and your recertification application has been delayed, and your household has very little income, check to see if you qualify for “expedited services” (ES) CalFresh (read more on PG. 495).

Although Medicare won’t start paying for your health care until you’re released, it’s important to get enrolled as soon as you can. This way, you avoid getting charged penalties for late enrollment, and you also ensure that your Medicare is ready as soon as you’re out.</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">When:</span> Contact the SSA to get enrolled during the 7-month period surrounding your 65<sup>th</sup> birthday—the month of your birthday, plus 3 months before, and 3 months following. This is called your Initial Enrollment Period (“IEP”). Supposing that you turn 65 on April 10, 2015, your Initial Enrollment Period would run from January 1, 2015 through July 31, 2015. If you don’t enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period, you may not have access to health care for months after you’re released; and you may get charged penalties if you try to enroll in Medicare later.<span class="emphasisitalic">How:</span> Send a signed and dated letter to the Social Security Administration. The letter should include your full name, Social Security Number, a clear statement that you want to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, and the date that your coverage should be effective. Make sure you sign the letter. Keep a copy of your letter and a copy of the envelope—and, if possible, send the letter by certified mail with return receipt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1482" id="footnote-ref-1482">[1482]</a></sup> </ol><h3><a id="_Toc290125912"></a><a id="_Toc448153326"></a>I had Medicare when I entered prison or jail.

If you already use a specific phone company, it may already participate in the LifeLine program (you can call the company and ask), or you may select a <em>new</em> telephone company that serves your area by searching online at: <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search"><strong>https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search</strong></a>.</h4><ol class="text">Remember, different phone companies provide different service plans, so you might want to shop around!</ol><h4 class="step">The telephone company will give you a Lifeline application form, with an Enrollment Code and/or a Personal Identification Number (PIN) in a pink envelope.

You may also apply online at <a href="https://www.californialifeline.com/en/login"><strong>https://www.californialifeline.com/en/login</strong></a></h4><ol class="text">Next, the telephone company will confirm your identity and whether you meet the one phone per household requirement, and then process your application.If you have any additional questions about your application, status, or due dates, please call the California LifeLine Administrator's hotline at 1-866-272-0349.What documents do I need to be found eligible?</ol><p class="text">First, you will need documents that prove who you are (your identity) to the phone company. You may need to show your Social Security card, birth certificate, and/or unexpired Driver License. For a complete list of acceptable forms of ID, see <a href="http://www.californialifeline.com">www.californialifeline.com</a>, or call 1-877-858-7463.

One way to prove this is to show that you receive public benefits from a qualifying state or federal assistance program. You may need to show a copy of your benefits program agreement or benefit card.<sup><a href="#footnote-1717" id="footnote-ref-1717">[1717]</a></sup>Finally, if you want to prove your eligibility based on your income, you must provide an official document proving your income—for example, an income statement from an employer, a prior year's tax return, a Social Security income statement, a Veterans Administration income statement, and/or a document proving you receive unemployment or some other public benefits.

Your benefits will start as soon as you activate your phone.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153380"></a>Once enrolled, what rules must I follow to remain eligible?</h3><p class="text">Aside from meeting the <em>program-based</em> or <em>income-based</em> guidelines, you cannot apply for more than one Lifeline phone per household, as previously discussed.If you do not follow this rule, you will lose your Lifeline phone and benefits, and you may be prosecuted by the federal government. This also means that you cannot be claimed as a dependent on anybody else's income tax return, and that you may not transfer your Lifeline discount to anyone else.<sup><a href="#footnote-1720" id="footnote-ref-1720">[1720]</a></sup>Also, you must recertify yourself as eligible once each year.

The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p><p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS </strong></p><p class="toc1">I.<strong>	</strong>INTRODUCTION: Looking for Work	600</p><p class="toc2">Preparing to enter the job market	600</p><p class="toc4">What can I expect as a job applicant with a criminal record?	600How will my criminal record affect my job prospects?	600What documents do I need before I apply for any job?	601How can I prepare for employers’ questions about my criminal record?	601</p><p class="toc2">How to present your best self	604</p><p class="toc4">How do I present my best self to an employer?	604</p><p class="toc3">Beef up your resume	604</p><p class="toc4">How can I build up my resume?	604</p><p class="toc3">Clean up your record	605</p><p class="toc4">Can I clean up my record?	605</p><p class="toc3">Target your job search	605</p><p class="toc4">How do I target my job search and find the best fit?	605Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record?	606</p><p class="toc3">Ace the job application	608</p><p class="toc4">How can i have a successful job application?	608</p><p class="toc3">Interview well	609</p><p class="toc4">How can I succeed in an interview?	609Bonding Insurance: What is it &amp;

Although it may be a tough process, finding a job is possible if you give it time and effort! It is important to get organized and learn about your options. This section will help you understand the unique rights that you have as a job applicant with a criminal record and how to exercise those rights during your job search. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153387"></a>How will my criminal record affect my job prospects?</h3><p class="text">Unfortunately, if you have a criminal record, it is harder to get hired, paid, and promoted fairly. But you are not alone—one in four adults in the U.S. has a criminal record,<sup><a href="#footnote-1721" id="footnote-ref-1721">[1721]</a></sup> and having a record does not mean you are unqualified for the job. If you take steps to understand your rights, responsibilities, and limitations, you can arm yourself with the knowledge necessary to secure the right job.Employers often conduct background checks on job applicants and current employees. In order to be prepared, you must be highly proactive about:</p><ol class="text">Learning strategies for how to present your skills, credentials, and personal background (for more information, see PG. 604); Understanding and cleaning up your criminal record (some record-cleaning can only happen later-on in reentry—for more information, see PG. 613); andKnowing and protecting your rights (for more information, see PG. 664).</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153388"></a>What documents do I need before I apply for any job?</h3><p class="text">You should get: (1) official ID and (2) copies of your criminal records to review.</p><div class="textstrongemphasis">OFFICIAL FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION:</div><p class="text">Before you apply for any job, you should begin the process of applying for basic government-issued IDs. (<em>To learn more about different forms of official ID, see the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21.) </em>In most cases, you will need at least:</p><ol class="text">A government-issued ID (such as a Driver License/ State ID, PG. 46, or Passport, PG. 64), ANDEITHER your Social Security Number (SSN) (PG. 40) OR your Birth Certificate (PG. 31).</ol><p class="text">You will need these ID documents when you apply for a job and complete the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9, which all employees in the United States must fill out. Form I-9 proves you are legally allowed to work in the country. Your employer should give you this form to fill out. See Appendix A, PG. 673, for more information about Form I-9.Please note that the employer cannot keep your documents, but may make a photocopy of them for your employment file.<sup><a href="#footnote-1722" id="footnote-ref-1722">[1722]</a></sup></p><div class="textstrongemphasis">COPIES OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS:</div><p class="text">You should get copies of your criminal records so that you know what employers are likely to find out if/when they run a background check. This will help you prepare to answer questions about your history and to address any concerns an employer may have. It’s also good to get a copy of your <em>official</em> criminal record (called a “RAP Sheet”) just for you, to make sure that all the information is accurate, and to correct errors if you find them. See UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029, for information about how to get a copy of your RAP sheet. See PG. 613, below, to learn more about background checks and what information your employer can see.<sup><a href="#footnote-1723" id="footnote-ref-1723">[1723]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153389"></a>How can I prepare for employers’ questions about my criminal record?</h3><h5 class="numberboldblack">Know everything about your official criminal record.</h5><p class="text">Knowing absolutely everything about your criminal record means that you know not only what is in your record, but also what is NOT in your record. You should be aware of all arrests, convictions, dismissals, and sentences that are currently part of your record, but you should also know about any information that has been dismissed, expunged, sealed, removed, or corrected. When you know what your record should look like, you will have a better understanding of how it will affect your job search, and you can make informed decisions about what steps you should take to improve your chances of getting hired.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1724" id="footnote-ref-1724">[1724]</a></sup></sup> </p><h5 class="numberboldblack">Know what employers might find out about you.</h5><h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR YOU &amp; YOUR RECORD</h4><p class="sidebox">Some of the information you will find on yourself will be things that employers CANNOT SEE, ASK ABOUT, or CONSIDER when you apply for a job. But it is good to know what information is out there, just to be aware of what employers might find and to know how to respond if illegal information shows up in a background check. For complete details on what criminal record information an employer can and cannot see, ask about, or consider, see PG. 615. For a brief summary of this information, read the Know Your Rights Box on PG. 603! </p><p class="text">To know what information an employer might find out about you, you will need to do research on yourself. Doing research on yourself is how you will see what information exists out there about you—not just what is in your official criminal record, but also anything public, especially on the Internet (for example, on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram). If you know what employers are going to see, you can be prepared to answer their questions about your history and address any of their concerns. You can also correct any mistakes, and ensure that agencies aren’t illegally providing information that they shouldn’t be reporting.Here are some suggestions for how to conduct research on yourself:</p><ol class="text"><em>Look online –</em> The best place to start is online. (If you don’t feel comfortable using a computer or the Internet, ask a trusted person—like a case manager, counselor, or friend—to help you.) Search for your name on <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> to see what shows up. If there is negative or untrue information, you (or a trusted person) can send an email to the person who posted the information or the website owner and politely ask them to remove it. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that they will do so, and it could require a lawsuit to get the information down. If the person running the website won’t remove the information, you may want to get the advice of a lawyer (see list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180).<em>Call your references</em> – When you apply for a job, the new employer and/or background check company may contact your past employer(s), people you list as references, and/or other people who know you (like a landlord, neighbor, or teacher) to find out about your work history or other information. An important way to research yourself is to call some of these people (or have a trusted person call for you) to find out what they will say about you. This way you know beforehand if someone is likely to say something negative about you, and you can be sure NOT to list them as a reference on the job application. For more information on listing references, see PG. 607. <em>Get copies of your criminal records</em> – To learn how to get copies of your official and unofficial criminal records, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</ol><h5 class="numberboldblack"> <a id="EM_WhatEmployersCanConsiderInCrimRecord"></a>Know what employers CAN &amp; CAN’T consider about your criminal record.</h5><p class="text">Knowing your employment rights means knowing what employers can and can’t do when it comes to reviewing and using your criminal history when deciding whether to hire you. It also means knowing how to prevent employers from violating your rights by not hiring you, and what actions you can take if your rights are violated. See PG. 637 to learn more about these rights and how to protect them. In the meantime, the here is a summary of what employers CAN and CAN’T consider about your criminal record.<sup><a href="#footnote-1725" id="footnote-ref-1725">[1725]</a></sup></p><h5 class="numberboldblack">Present yourself in the best way possible.</h5><p class="text">Presenting yourself in the best way possible means doing what you can to reduce any negative impressions that your criminal record may cause. This might include addressing your past during job interviews and talking about your rehabilitation efforts and all the changes you have gone through; obtaining proof of rehabilitation, where possible (see Appendix C, PG. 679); making thoughtful decisions about what jobs you apply for (see PG. 605); and cleaning up your record, where it is possible (see PG. 605).<sup><a href="#footnote-1726" id="footnote-ref-1726">[1726]</a></sup> </p><h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_KYR_EmployersAndCriminalRecord"></a>Let’s Review:<br />KNOW YOUR RIGHTSA Summary of What Employers CAN &amp; CAN’T Find Out About Your Criminal Record</h4><p class="headingbold11">Employers CAN:</p><ul class="textbox">Run a background check on you and CAN consider certain criminal history information when deciding whether to hire you.See and ask about: convictions and unresolved (pending) arrests, charges, or cases.

Your volunteer work can help to calm an employer’s concerns about your past, and strong references can go a very long way in helping to secure a future paying position.<strong> </strong></p><ol class="text">Ace the job applicationInterview wellUnderstand and explain the benefits to the employer</ol><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153392"></a>Beef up your resume</h2><h3><a id="_Toc448153393"></a>How can I build up my resume?</h3><p class="text"><strong><em>1. Explore volunteer opportunities. </em></strong>Volunteering is a great way to learn new skills, gain solid references, find out about local job opportunities, and show potential employers that you are dedicated and responsible. Although it is usually unpaid, it strengthens your application and offers experiences you can talk about in your job search.<strong><em>2. Go back to school. </em></strong>Going back to school to get your GED or advanced college or professional degree shows that you are responsible, focused and driven—all qualities that employers look for when hiring. As a practical matter, going back to school can offer you training to expand your skillset and qualify you for more jobs. <strong><em>3. Participate in a reentry program. </em></strong>Employers will be impressed if you are proactive and take steps to grow and learn from challenging past situations. Reentry programs in your local area may be able to help you in your job search, and support you in your transition. To find out about reentry programs or other employment opportunities, we recommend that you attend local reentry fairs and/or talk to people (in prison or jail or outside) who might know about these programs. Ask your counselor or case manager, parole or probation officer, mentor or sponsor, or others for recommendations.</p><h4 class="sidebox">TALK TO YOUR TRUSTED PERSON</h4><p class="sidebox">Talk to your trusted person or someone at a workforce development program to see what school, work, and volunteer opportunities are available in your area, and for other ideas about how to build your resume and gain new skills.</p><p class="text"><strong><em>4. Participate in workforce development (job readiness) programs. </em></strong>Many organizations have workforce development or job readiness programs for people with criminal records or other employment barriers. These programs help you to search for jobs, improve your job skills, and prepare for job applications and interviews. They provide services like job counseling, job training, resume writing, interview coaching, and sometimes job placement and referrals. Even if there are no reentry-focused job readiness programs in your area, look for programs with similar services. Sometimes the only workforce development program near you will be an America’s Job Center, which is run by the government. If the America’s Job Center is your only option, then you should definitely take advantage of the case managers and other programs there. However, if there are other workforce programs available in your area, we recommend that you use those first, since they can provide more individual attention and help. For a list of workforce development programs around the state, see Appendix B, PG. 677, or call 2-1-1 to ask about programs in your area.</p><h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_HH_EDD_OneStopCenter"></a>HELPFUL HINTWhat are America’s Job Centers of California?</h4><p class="textbox">America’s Job Centers of California (once called One-Stop Career Centers) are job readiness centers run by the state through the California Employment Development Department (EDD), a state agency that assists workers and employers. America’s Job Centers provide FREE services and resources to people looking for work, including: job counseling to figure out what jobs are right for you; free access to phones, fax machines, computers, and Internet; job search and résumé writing workshops; community resources and referrals for training; and job fairs.To find an America’s Job Center near you, go to <a href="http://www.americasjobcenter.ca.gov/">http://www.americasjobcenter.ca.gov/</a>.

Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, freedom and flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibilities at work. Think about your skills, interests, and previous work experience or vocational training. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, read the section on “Alternatives to Traditional Employment,” starting on PG. 660 for more information and helpful resources on starting your own business.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153395"></a>Can I clean up my record? </h3><p class="text">Maybe. Your record is not necessarily permanent for the purpose of getting a job. You may be able to clear—or more likely lessen the impact of (in other words, “clean up”)—your criminal record, making you more attractive to potential employers. For more information about the different ways to clean up your record, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029. Different organizations may offer “clean slate” services in your area, such as:</p><ol class="text">Public Defenders Offices“Clean Slate” or “Second Chance Clinic” programsCivil Legal Aid Programs</ol><p class="text">For more information about finding “clean slate” services and programs in your area, see the list of legal aid providers on PG 1180.

Consider the type of job you’re applying for.</em></div><p class="text">Employers will be more concerned if the job position you are applying for requires you to do work that directly relates to your past convictions. For example, if you’ve been convicted of theft, this may concern an employer who is looking to hire someone to become a manager or cashier at a store. If you can proactively point out that the circumstances of your crime—including the seriousness of the offense and the length of time since it occurred—won’t affect your ability to do the job, an employer is more likely to feel you will be an honest and truthful worker. Also, there may be some types of jobs or occupational licenses that you can’t hold by law, based on your conviction offense. See PG. 652 for more information about legal restrictions for certain types of jobs.</p><div class="textstrongemphasis"><em>2. Consider the type of employer you’re applying to. </em></div><p class="text">Consider the type, size, and management style of the company to which you are applying. Most applications ask whether or not you have been convicted of a crime, but some only ask about felonies. Some experts suggest that applying to a small business could be more successful than a larger corporation, because this allows you the opportunity to speak directly with the owner and explain what happened.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153398"></a>Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record?</h3><p class="text">It’s possible. Before applying for work, you should know that a few types of jobs have legal restrictions that disqualify people with certain past convictions from working in that position. Also, certain types of jobs require you to have a professional or occupational license from the state, and such licenses have their own legal restrictions and can be difficult to get depending on what’s in your record. For more information on legal restrictions and professional licenses—and how you can become re-eligible to work in some cases—see “Jobs &amp; Professions Your Record Might Exclude You From,” starting on PG. 652.<em>Examples of jobs with legal restrictions for certain types of convictions:</em></p><ol class="text">Airport security screeners;Federal law enforcement officers;Bank employees;Childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies;Port workers.</ol><p class="text"><em>Examples of jobs that require a professional or occupational license:</em></p><ol class="text">Barber;Beautician / Cosmetologist;Pharmacist;Nurse;Cemetery / funeral home worker;Real estate agent.</ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Most jobs do NOT have legal restrictions. The information here isn’t intended to discourage you, but to help you understand your options and find the job that’s right for you. Also, even if an employer cannot hire you for one type of job based on your record, they may have other types of jobs available that you ARE eligible for and could do instead.</p><a id="EM_JobApplication"></a><h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTConsider All Your Job Options </h4><p class="textbox">As you’re thinking about jobs or looking for work, it can be helpful to think about other work options—alternatives to traditional employment—like starting your own business, joining a worker-run cooperative business, or going through a temp agency. You may decide that one of these alternatives is more exciting, more convenient for your schedule and needs, or just a good way to get your foot in the door with an employer.Here are some other ways of working and earning an income that are different from traditional employment:</p><ul class="textbox">Consider self-employment or become an independent contractorStart your own businessJoin a worker-run cooperative businessApply through a temp agencyTake short-term jobs or temporary positions to get your foot in the door.</ul><p class="textbox">For more information on each of these options, read section on Alternatives to Traditional Employment, starting on PG. 660 below.</p><a id="_Toc448153399"></a><h2 class="subheading2">Ace the job application</h2><h4 class="sidebox">A NOTE ABOUT BAD REFERENCES</h4><p class="sidebox">Under state law, former employers and other references ARE allowed to say negative things about you as part of a job reference.<em>So you should always ask your reference if they are willing to be listed, and you can ask what they will say about you before you list them.</em></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153400"></a>How can i have a successful job application?</h3><p class="text">In the past, applying for a job meant filling out a paper application and handing (or mailing) it to the employer. Now, any information that you give about yourself may become part of your job application that the employer considers. This includes information you share with the employer or other employees at the company, with a temp agency, at a job fair, at a workforce development center, or with other people or organizations that are involved in your job search process. It can include paperwork you fill out or sign, a questionnaire that you complete, information that you type in online, documents you hand in, or answers/information that you say in person.</p><h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTS</h4><ol class="text"><em>Listing Previous Work Experience</em></ol><p class="textbox">If an application asks about your previous work experience, MAKE SURE you accurately write the dates of your previous employment and how much you were paid! The new employer will probably contact your former employers to check your references and ask about this information. If you list incorrect information about the dates you were employed or your wages at your past job (even by mistake!), the new employer may think you’re intentionally lying and may reject your application for that reason. If you can’t remember the exact dates you worked or your wages, write down that you are guessing or estimating this information, and that you are NOT certain. This will show the employer that you’re trying to be honest and are not intentionally giving wrong information.</p><ol class="text"><em>Listing personal and professional references</em></ol><p class="textbox">When you apply for a job, you will probably have to give a list of references—people who know you and can talk about whether you’re a good worker. Most likely this will be an old employer, but it could also be a teacher from a vocational training or certification program, or even someone from your church or other community organization that you’re involved in. The new employer will contact these people to ask about your previous work history, personality, whether you were a good employee, and other information to help decide if they should hire you.Be careful about whom you list as a reference and what they will say about you! BEFORE you list someone as a reference, it is best to call the person (or have a trusted person call for you) to ask what they will say about you. If it turns out they say something negative, you’ll know not to list them after all. Keep in mind that even if you don’t list someone as a reference, an employer or background check company may still contact them as part of their own background check process.</p><ol class="text"><em>Ask your trusted person!</em></ol><p class="textbox">If you’re filling out a paper or online application, ask your trusted person, or someone from a local reentry or workforce development program, to look over your completed application before you send it to the employer.</p><h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153401"></a>Interview well</h2><h3><a id="_Toc448153402"></a>How can I succeed in an interview?</h3><p class="text">Here is a list of the essential steps to prepare for and succeed in an interview with a potential employer.

If your employer requires fidelity bonding insurance, there are two options: (1) private fidelity bonding insurance, and (2) the Federal Bonding Program.<strong><em>(1) Private Bonding Insurance—</em></strong>Many private insurance companies sell fidelity bonding insurance that employers can buy. The insurance will reimburse employers for losses due to things like forgery, theft of money or valuables, or fraud by a company employee. An employer can buy insurance coverage for ALL employees, or for only a few, specific employees.<sup><a href="#footnote-1727" id="footnote-ref-1727">[1727]</a></sup> However, if you already have a criminal conviction record, your employer may not be able to get private bonding insurance for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1728" id="footnote-ref-1728">[1728]</a></sup> In this case, the employer may be able to get bonding insurance through a special federal government program (see immediately below). <strong><em>(2) Federal Bonding Program—</em></strong>If you already have a criminal conviction record, your employer may not be able to get private bonding insurance for you. If you are applying for a job with an employer who requires employees to be covered by fidelity bonding insurance, the federal government has a special program to provide FREE fidelity bonding insurance for 6 months to cover individuals who are eligible for the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1729" id="footnote-ref-1729">[1729]</a></sup> In California, the California Employment Development Department (EDD)—the same state agency that runs America’s Job Centers of California—runs the Federal Bonding Program. For more information and instructions on how to apply for the Federal Bonding Program, see Appendix E, PG. 682.</p><h5 class="question">Am I eligible for the Federal Bonding Program?</h5><p class="text">If you meet the following requirements, you may be eligible for the Federal Bonding Program:</p><ol class="text">You have a firm job offer (or are already employed) at a job that is likely to be long-term or permanent. The job requires you to be bonded, and you cannot get private bonding insurance due to your arrest or conviction record, history of drug or alcohol abuse, poor credit or employment history, dishonorable discharge from the military, or other “risk” factors.The employer is ready to hire you (or keep you on the job) once you have insurance, so the only thing stopping you from working there is the lack of insurance.You are 18 or older and legally eligible to work in the U.S.</ol><p class="text">For a complete list of eligibility requirements, see Appendix E, PG. 682. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Your employer can only get free insurance coverage for the first 6 months that you work there; after that they will have to purchase insurance directly. If you switch to another job that also requires bonding, you will have to reapply to the EDD, and they will decide on a case-by-case basis whether you can get new insurance coverage at the new employer. If you left your previous job on good terms, you will have a better chance of getting bonding insurance for your next job, but it is not guaranteed.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1730" id="footnote-ref-1730">[1730]</a></sup></strong> For this reason, it’s recommended that you only use the bonding program for jobs that are likely to be long-term or permanent—NOT for temporary positions.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1731" id="footnote-ref-1731">[1731]</a></sup></strong></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153404"></a>Work Opportunity Tax Credits: What are they &amp; how can they encourage employers to hire me?</h3><p class="text">Suggest that your employer look into the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal tax credit historically available to employers for hiring job applicants who face significant barriers to employment, including people with felony convictions who are hired within 1 year after their conviction or release from prison, veterans, and recipients of certain public benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1732" id="footnote-ref-1732">[1732]</a></sup> (For this reason, be sure to answer truthfully if an employer or job application asks whether you receive public benefits!) The WOTC ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, depending on your hours and pay during your first year as an employee, and on the maximum allowed credit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1733" id="footnote-ref-1733">[1733]</a></sup> For more information about the WOTC in California, contact the WOTC Coordinator at (916) 227-5163, or visit the Employment Development Department’s (EDD) website about the WOTC at: <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm</a>. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Although the legal authority for the WOTC expired on December 31, 2013, tell your employer that he/she should continue to submit WOTC applications to the EDD. In the past, when the WOTC expired, Congress eventually reauthorized the tax credit and applied it retroactively; so it’s recommended that employers continue to submit applications while reauthorization is pending.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1734" id="footnote-ref-1734">[1734]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p><a id="EM_KeyTerms"></a><a id="_Toc448153405"></a><h1 class="subheading">Key terms in the employment chapter</h1><h4 class="sidebox">Get a Copy of Your RAP Sheet</h4><p class="sidebox">You can request a copy of your RAP sheet from the California Department of Justice (DOJ) by filling out an application, getting fingerprinted, and sending everything to the DOJ. It can take a couple weeks for the DOJ to process your request and send you an official RAP sheet. For more information on getting a copy of your RAP sheet, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029.If you don’t want to wait for your RAP sheet, you can also get a copy of your court records directly from the courthouse where you were convicted. If you go to the court in person, you can often get a copy of your records the very same day. Some courts will also let you request your records online, without having to go in person (although you will have to wait longer for the court to mail you the paper copies). To get your court records, you will need to have (or look up) your case number, and you will probably have to pay a fee for photocopying (usually around 50 cents/page). </p><p class="text">Before we discuss the laws that will affect you as you reenter the job market, let’s review a few key terms. (For more detailed definitions and explanations of these terms, see UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029).<strong>Criminal Record:</strong><span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>This is the general term we use for all of the information about your criminal history. Your “criminal record” includes arrests, charges against you, convictions, pleas, acquittals, dismissals, sentences, and any other time your contact with law enforcement was documented.<strong> RAP Sheet:</strong><span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>A RAP sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) is the government’s official version of your criminal record. It lists every contact you’ve had with the criminal justice system, including arrests, convictions, acquittals, dismissals, and sentences.<sup><a href="#footnote-1735" id="footnote-ref-1735">[1735]</a></sup> If you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime in California, you could have 3 different RAP sheets:</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">County RAP sheet</span>—all of your criminal justice contact in a single county (so if you have arrests or convictions in more than one county, you will have a separate RAP sheet for each county); <span class="emphasisitalic">California DOJ RAP sheet</span>—all of your contact with the criminal justice system across the state of California;<sup><a href="#footnote-1736" id="footnote-ref-1736">[1736]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">FBI RAP sheet</span>—all of your contact with the criminal justice system from anywhere in the U.S. (so if you have arrests or convictions in more than one state, all of these should show up on your FBI RAP sheet).<sup><a href="#footnote-1737" id="footnote-ref-1737">[1737]</a></sup></ol><p class="text"><strong>Background Check:</strong> This is the process of looking up information about someone’s past activities—their criminal records, finances and credit, or other personal information—through public records, Internet searches, or interviewing people you know. When you apply for a job, the employer will most likely pay an outside company to run a background check on you. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You have legal rights when someone runs a background check on you! The law limits what information can be included in your background check and what information employers, landlords, and others can use, and it allows you to challenge mistakes and violations. </p><p class="text"><strong>Consumer Report</strong>—This is the technical, legal name of the document that that is produced when an employer (or anyone else) runs a background check on you (produced by private companies called “Consumer Reporting Agencies”—see next definition). Since “consumer report” is the technical term, but not used by most, this Chapter uses the layperson term “background check reports.”<strong>Reporting Agency</strong>—This is a company that investigates and produces background check reports.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1738" id="footnote-ref-1738">[1738]</a></sup></sup> They’re also called Consumer Reporting Agencies (federal law) and Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies (state law), but this Chapter uses the layperson term “background check companies.”</p><h2><a id="EM_BackgroundCheckRights"></a><a id="_Toc448153406"></a>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS on Employment BACKGROUND CHECKS</h2><p class="textbox">This section explains the laws and your rights when an employer runs a background check on you for a job.

This includes arrests where the charges against you were never brought, charges were dismissed, and cases where you were found not guilty. THERE ARE 3 EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE YOU SHOULD KNOW:<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1748" id="footnote-ref-1748">[1748]</a></sup>First, private and public employers can still ask about recent arrests that are pending or unresolved (for example, if you were arrested, posted bail money, and are awaiting trial, the arrest is still considered pending, and employers can learn out about those). PLEASE NOTE: If you live in a city or county that has “banned the box,” the rule for when employers can ask about pending arrests is different. See PG. 615 for more information about when an employer can ask.Second, law enforcement employers can ask about and consider all arrests.Third, health care facilities and pharmacy employers can ask about and consider CERTAIN arrests (for drug and/or sexual offenses) if you are applying for a job with regular access to drugs or medications (for drug arrests), or to patients (for sexual offense arrests).<em>Arrests that led to the completion of a court diversion program.</em> A court diversion program (such as a drug rehabilitation program) helps a person charged with certain crimes avoid criminal charges—and therefore avoid a criminal record.

This CANNOT come up in a background check.<strong> </strong></p><p class="importantbox">REMEMBER: In general, if an employer asks you if you were ever arrested, you SHOULD NOT answer that question, and you DO NOT have to.

This law applies statewide to ALL state and local government employers, but does NOT apply to <em>federal government jobs</em>, <em>jobs with law enforcement, or positions that require a criminal background check by law</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1752" id="footnote-ref-1752">[1752]</a></sup> </p><ol class="text"><em>Please Note:</em> The current interpretation of California's "Ban the Box" law is that it does <em>not</em> apply to community colleges in their function as state employers, meaning that they are legally allowed to ask you <em>certain questions </em>about your criminal record in the initial application—but nothing from the list of “never-ask” criminal background questions starting on PG. 615).</ol><p class="answer">Some cities and counties in California (such as San Francisco, Richmond, and Compton) have passed their own local “Ban the Box” laws that sometimes apply to certain private employers. Los Angeles County is currently considering passing its own local “Ban the Box” law in 2016, as well. See Appendix F, PG. 684, for more information about local “Ban the Box” laws in California (such as the one in San Francisco called the “Fair Chance Ordinance”).</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153414"></a>When can a private employer in California ask about my criminal record?</h3><p class="text">It depends on your city and county. For many years, across the entire state, a private employer could ask certain questions about your criminal record at any time, and most private employers can still ask these questions AT ANY TIME. Recently, however, San Francisco passed a “Ban the Box” law that applies to private employers. This means that in SF, employers must wait to ask about records until AFTER they have determined the person would be qualified, just like public employers must around the state. For now, San Francisco is the ONLY county in which “Ban the Box” legislation applies to private employers, but other cities and counties are considering similar legislation. See Appendix G, PG. 686, for a full explanation of the San Francisco law, called the Fair Chance Ordinance.In addition, the cities of Richmond and Compton have implemented “Ban the Box” laws that apply to government contractors—meaning private employers that have contracts with the local city government. If you are applying to a job with a private contractor in one of those cities, you should find out if “Ban the Box” would apply to you.

Did the employer say anything about your record, or about (not) hiring people with criminal records? Any of these can help show that the employer did run a background check on you, and may have rejected your application based on information in your background check.If you feel comfortable, you can try talking to the employer directly. You can explain that you are trying to improve your application for the future, and then ask why the employer did not select your application and what you can do to improve your chances in the future.In some cases, the employer may say something that reveals he/she made a decision based on your record or other information in your background check—for example, a negative comment about your being trustworthy, creating a risk to others, or about people with criminal records, in general. If this happens, make sure that you write down afterward exactly what the employer said!In other cases, the employer may actually give you a helpful explanation that really can help you to improve your job applications in the future. This may show that the employer really did have some other reason for not hiring you, or at the very least can give you help you to be more successful for future jobs.Finally, the employer may not give you any explanation for their decision, or may simply say that other people were more qualified or applied before you.

For this reason, it’s important to always check the box to request a copy of the report when you give permission to an employer to run a background check on you.If you didn’t check the box before, you can still get a copy of the report in 2 ways:</p><ol class="text">If the employer decides take an adverse (negative) action against you—such as rejecting your job application—they must give you a copy of the background check report before taking the action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1792" id="footnote-ref-1792">[1792]</a></sup>The background check company is required to give you a copy of the same report sent to the employer, if you ask for it within (at least) 2 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-1793" id="footnote-ref-1793">[1793]</a></sup></ol><p class="text"><strong>STEP 2: </strong>If there are errors or inaccurate information on the background check report, it’s recommended that you point this out to the employer right away. If possible, you may also want to show the employer any proof of the correct information—for example, court papers showing that your conviction has been expunged, or that charges against you were dismissed. You also have the right to make the background check company correct the information, and send the employer a notice and statement of the correction. For more information on correcting information with the background check company and notifying the employer of the correction, see PG. 631 below.<strong>STEP 3:</strong> If the employer asks you about things that should NOT have been in your background check report—such as convictions that are more than 7 years old—it’s recommended you answer the question directly and honestly, but briefly:</p><ol class="text">You can take responsibility for your actions. State the facts, but express regret for what happened. Don’t get defensive. Be honest, but don’t go into details. You don’t need to go into details. Keep your answer short. Be honest, but only talk about necessary information based on the questions you are asked.You can the employer how you have changed. Emphasize that the incident happened long ago and that you are a different person now. Explain what you learned while you were in prison/jail, and what you are doing differently now. Paint a picture of the person you are now. You can emphasize your qualifications. Describe the things that will make you a good employee—such as previous work experience, job training programs, or classes that you’ve done—and any letters of recommendation that you have. Show the employer why you are qualified for the position and will be a benefit to the company.You can describe your hopes and dreams. Show the employer than you are in control of your life and have short-term and long-term goals. Highlight any services that you’re getting to help you move on and achieve your goals. Emphasize that you would be very appreciative of the opportunity to work for them, and you will be the hardest worker they will ever have.<sup><a href="#footnote-1794" id="footnote-ref-1794">[1794]</a></sup> </ol><p class="text"><strong>STEP 4: </strong>If the employer asks you (or makes comments) about incorrect or improper information in your background check report, you may want to write down anything the employer says and anything you say to the employer, so that you have a record to protect your rights later.</p><h4 class="textbox">know your rightsSummary of your rights if an employer runs a background check through a private background check company:</h4><ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report.

The employer can look at your public records directly, as well as interview your friends, family members, and former employers or co-workers. This “in-house” type of background check is a less common practice, but it is important for you to understand that if an employer chooses this route, there are different legal protections than when a private company runs the background check. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153426"></a>How does an in-house background check work?</h3><p class="text">An in-house background check is very similar to a third-party background check by an outside Background check company, except the employer alone is responsible for conducting the research, without any outside assistance.Any employer may conduct an in-house background search in the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-1795" id="footnote-ref-1795">[1795]</a></sup></p><ol class="text">Looking at public records, such as criminal convictions and civil judgments. You have a right to see any public records that the employer looked at; see PG. 627 below for more information.Talking to friends, neighbors, former employers, or colleagues about your character, reputation, or living situation. The questions should be related to job skills, ability to work with others, attendance, attitude, and ability to follow instructions and receive criticism.Verifying school records—your attendance and any degrees you earned. However, employers cannot see your transcripts (courses and grades) or other school records (e.g., disciplinary records) unless you give written consent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1796" id="footnote-ref-1796">[1796]</a></sup>Online searches—like searching for your name on Google, looking at your Facebook page, checking other social networking sites (Twitter, MySpace, etc.), and checking websites that post mug shots.<sup><a href="#footnote-1797" id="footnote-ref-1797">[1797]</a></sup> Note: An employer cannot ask you for your social networking username or password or make you show them your online profile.<sup><a href="#footnote-1798" id="footnote-ref-1798">[1798]</a></sup></ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153427"></a>What rules govern California employers who run in-house checks? </h3><p class="text">The law is more relaxed about in-house background checks than it is about outside background check companies’ background checks. This means that you have fewer rights when it comes to being notified, giving your permission, and challenging the results of in-house background checks. However, if an employer is running his/her own in-house background check on you, they still must follow certain rules. Here is what the employer is and isn’t legally required to do:</p><ol class="text">The employer may request your permission, but it’s not required. Look carefully at the job application form—the employer might ask to run an in-house background check right on the application form itself.The employer must give you a copy of public records used in the report—unless you check the box to waive (give up) this right. Be careful—the job application or other forms MAY have a box that you can check to waive (give up) your right to see the public records,<sup><a href="#footnote-1799" id="footnote-ref-1799">[1799]</a></sup> and it’s recommended that you do not check that box!</ol><p class="importantbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: You can ALWAYS get a copy of PUBLIC RECORDS used by the employer. You have a legal right to get a copy of the public records used by the employer, and it’s recommended that you never give up (“waive”) that right!<strong> </strong>It’s recommended that you always indicate that you DO want to see the public records report, and make sure you DON’T check a box waiving your right. What to look out for: </p><ul class="importantbox">The box to waive your rights will probably say something like this: “I further understand that the Company may obtain Public Records about me as part of an internal background investigation and that I may waive my right to receive a copy of such Public Records by checking the box to the right.”<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1800" id="footnote-ref-1800">[1800]</a></sup></strong> It’s recommended that you DON’T CHECK THIS BOX!This can be confusing because it is the opposite of what happens when the employer hires a private background check company to do the background check (in which case <em>it is recommended </em>that you check the box to request a copy of the <em>background check report</em>).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1801" id="footnote-ref-1801">[1801]</a></sup></strong> </ul><ol class="text">If you don’t waive your right to view the public records gathered about you, the employer must give you a copy of the public records within 7 days after it receives them.<sup><a href="#footnote-1802" id="footnote-ref-1802">[1802]</a></sup> EXCEPTION: In California, if your existing or future employer wants to run an in-house background check because it suspects you of misconduct or wrongdoing, the employer is not required to reveal its findings until after the investigation is over. However, upon completion of the investigation, the employer must give you a copy of the public records unless you waived (gave up) your rights (so again, its recommended that you don’t give up your right to a copy of those public records!).<sup><a href="#footnote-1803" id="footnote-ref-1803">[1803]</a></sup> If the employer takes any adverse (negative) action against you—such as deciding not to hire you—because of information in the public records, the employer must give you a copy of the public records even if you checked the box that waived your right to see the records.<sup><a href="#footnote-1804" id="footnote-ref-1804">[1804]</a></sup><br />The employer is not required to give you information it gets from NON-PUBLIC sources, such as checking your references with past employers, verifying your education records, or talking to people who know you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1805" id="footnote-ref-1805">[1805]</a></sup> </ol><h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTImportant things to know about listing references and previous jobs</h4><p class="textbox">When you apply for a job, the new employer will often contact your former employers and other people you list as references, in order to find out if you were a good employee and to decide if they should hire you. Keep in mind that a former employer CAN say negative things about you as part of a job reference even suspected criminal activity, regardless of whether you were convicted of anything—so long as they reasonably believe the information is true and they are not simply acting out of meanness towards you.Also, the new employer is NOT required to tell you what these people said about you, and they can say positive or negative things. It’s recommended that you check in with your references BEFORE listing them, so that you know what they will say about you. (You can also ask someone you trust—a case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or friend—to call for you.) Finally, the new employer will also check the dates when you worked at your previous jobs and how much you earned—so make sure you know the EXACT dates and amount you earned, or it could seem like you are being dishonest in a new job application.

Specifically, the employer is required to ask you whether you want copies of these public records. If you checked “yes” when asked whether you want a copy (which it is recommended that you do), by law the employer must send you the public records in the mail and give you the opportunity to examine them thoroughly. If you find incorrect or misleading information, you can inform your employer about the false information, so he or she does not rely on it as accurate. Then you can attempt to get the errors fixed.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153430"></a>If an employer relied on inaccurate public records, what can I do? </h3><p class="text">If an employer ran his/her own background check and relied on inaccurate public records, you can:</p><ol class="text">Contact your employer as soon as possible, to prevent any confusion.Send a written letter or e-mail (“written notice”) to the employer, pointing out the incorrect or incomplete records, and request that the employer re-investigate the records.Provide the employer with proof, including copies of any official documents to show why the information is incorrect, outdated, or incomplete. (For example: you could give the employer court papers showing that your convictions have been dismissed or “expunged” in some way.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1806" id="footnote-ref-1806">[1806]</a></sup>You can fix the errors in your public records by contacting the agency that produced the incorrect record. For example, if you need to fix incorrect information about a tax lien, contact the IRS; if you need to fix the record of a legal matter (civil or criminal case), contact the clerk at the courthouse that processed your legal case. </ol><p class="text">It is important to remember that you only have the legal right to know about public records that an employer uses.

In general, the law says that employers should only consider your criminal history if it directly relates to your ability to do the job, and cannot use your criminal record to discriminate based on your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. However, there is often a gap between what the law says on paper—about your rights as a job applicant or employee, and about the employer’s duties to treat you fairly—and how employers act in real life. It can also be difficult to <em>prove</em> that an employer has illegally discriminated against you, which can make it difficult to enforce your rights.

There are some laws that protect applicants from this type of employment discrimination. While employers can legally consider convictions that might impact your ability to do the duties of the job safely and adequately, there are civil rights laws that make it illegal for employers to treat you differently from other applicants or employees based on your race, sex, religion, national origin, and other protected characteristics (called “protected classes”).While it is sometimes legal for an employer to not hire or fire you because of your criminal record, an employer’s hiring policy is more likely to be illegal if they have a <strong>complete ban (called a “blanket ban”)</strong> on job applicants with records. Under law, the correct and legal practice is for the employer to consider <strong>the individual circumstances of the person applying for the job</strong> and <strong>the job itself</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1847" id="footnote-ref-1847">[1847]</a></sup> In most cases, it is illegal for an employer to have a complete or “blanket” ban on applicants with criminal records because these kinds of bans cause greater harm to Black and Latino applicants (“protected classes”) under a federal civil rights law known as “Title VII” (this law is explained in more detail in Appendix J, PG. 695)<sup><a href="#footnote-1848" id="footnote-ref-1848">[1848]</a></sup> Because Blacks and Latinos are incarcerated at dramatically higher rates than people of other races in the United States,<sup><a href="#footnote-1849" id="footnote-ref-1849">[1849]</a></sup> excluding applicants with criminal records is likely to have a greater impact on these protected classes. Under law then, a <strong>“blanket ban”</strong> is only legal if the employer can show that the ban is <strong>“job related”</strong> and <strong>“consistent with business necessity”</strong>—meaning that your conviction affects your ability to do specific duties of the job, and the ban is necessary for the good of the business.<sup><a href="#footnote-1850" id="footnote-ref-1850">[1850]</a></sup> If an employer chooses not to hire individuals based solely on their records, the employer must be able to show that that this is necessary to ensure safe and efficient job performance<sup> </sup>for the position in question.<sup><a href="#footnote-1851" id="footnote-ref-1851">[1851]</a></sup> In doing so, and employer must show that they evaluated the applicant’s ability to perform the duties of the job and whether any past conviction(s) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm, based on the specific requirements and responsibilities of the position.<sup><a href="#footnote-1852" id="footnote-ref-1852">[1852]</a></sup> Of course, these laws still give the employer a lot of discretion and room to discriminate, but they require the employer to do individualized analysis of each job applicant.</p><h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT: What does a complete ban look like? </h4><p class="textbox">Sometimes the employer’s job posting, employment application, written policy, or some other part of the application process will show that the employer does not hire or employ people with criminal records. The policy may apply to all convictions, certain types of convictions (e.g., all felonies, or all theft offenses), and/or for convictions that occurred during a certain period of time (e.g., within the past 7 years). Or the policy may not be written down anywhere, but the employer says that they do not hire people with (certain) criminal records, or the employer’s hiring practices over time show that they always reject applicants with (certain) conviction records. These are all examples of complete bans—and are likely illegal because of their effect on minority, protected groups.</p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you see something, you can say something!This section explains the civil rights laws that protect people with criminal records against discrimination by employers. However, there is often a gap between what the law says employers SHOULD do, and what employers ACTUALLY do. The courts are still figuring out how civil rights laws protect people with criminal records in different situations, because many of the cases on this subject are new. For this reason, it’s important that you talk to a lawyer and/or contact the appropriate government-run civil rights protection agency if you think an employer has violated your rights. You won’t just be protecting your own rights—you’ll be standing up for the rights of all people with criminal records to be free from employment discrimination!</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153446"></a>What laws protect applicants from discrimination based on their criminal record?</h3><p class="text">The laws that give applicants with records some protection are (1) the federal civil rights law called “Title VII,” (2) the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) Enforcement Guidance on Title VII,<sup><a href="#footnote-1853" id="footnote-ref-1853">[1853]</a></sup> and (3) California state laws that are very similar to these federal laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-1854" id="footnote-ref-1854">[1854]</a></sup> Learn more about these laws in the Appendix J, PG. 695 and Appendix K, PG. 696.Under these civil rights laws, an employer CANNOT have a <a id="EM_BlanketBan"></a><strong>“blanket ban”</strong> policy that permanently excludes anyone and everyone with a criminal record. Instead, the employer’s hiring policy should only exclude convictions that are “job related for the position” and “consistent with business necessity.” This means that the employer should look at a number of factors when considering the convictions, such as:</p><ol class="text"><strong>The nature and seriousness of the conviction, ANDHow much time has passed since the conviction, conduct, or completion of the sentence, ANDThe nature of the job you’re seeking—including the specific duties and responsibilities of the job.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1855" id="footnote-ref-1855">[1855]</a></sup></ol><p class="text">For a more detailed description of how employers should look at these factors, see the rules below.</p><h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_HH_ProtectedClass"></a>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS:What is a protected class?</h4><p class="textbox">“Protected classes” are groups of people that have historically experienced discrimination, and therefore are specifically protected by civil rights and anti-discrimination laws—for example, African Americans, women, immigrants, LGBTQI individuals, and people with disabilities. The specific characteristic that makes someone part of a protected class—for example, their race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identity, and/or disability status. Under the law, it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on a protected characteristic. However, it is generally NOT illegal to discriminate against someone for some other reason that is NOT protected (for example, the color of their shirt).IMPORTANT: Having a criminal record is NOT considered a protected class under the law. However, discriminating against people with criminal records can still be illegal in many situations because it has a much greater effect on Blacks and Latinos. Also, it is illegal for an employer to treat people with similar records in a different manner, based on any protected characteristics. For more information about different kinds of discrimination based on criminal record, see PG. 643 below.What groups are “protected classes” under the law?

These limits depend on the size of the employer:</p><ul class="sidebox">For employers with 15-100 employees, the limit is $50,000.For employers with 101-200 employees, the limit is $100,000.For employers with 201-500 employees, the limit is $200,000.For employers with more than 500 employees, the limit is $300,000.</ul><p class="sidebox">42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3)</p><p class="text">The types of remedies that might be available to you will depend upon what the employer did (the “discriminatory action”) and how it affected you. For example, if an employer refused to hire you for an illegally discriminatory reason, the remedy may include hiring you for the job or giving you any back pay or benefits that you would have received if you had been hired. If you filed a lawsuit in court, you may also get back any money you spent on attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and court costs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1866" id="footnote-ref-1866">[1866]</a></sup>You also may be awarded “compensatory” or “punitive damages.” For intentional cases of discrimination based on a person's race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, disability, or genetic information, compensatory and punitive damages may be awarded. Note: punitive and compensatory damages are rare, and should never be expected.</p><ol class="text">Compensatory damages repay victims for out-of-pocket expenses caused by the discrimination (such as costs of continuing with a job search) and compensate them for any emotional harm suffered because of the discrimination.Punitive damages may be awarded to punish an employer who has committed an especially hateful or careless act of discrimination.</ol><p class="text">In addition, the employer may be required to stop any discriminatory practices immediately and take steps to make sure not to discriminate again in the future. For example, if the employer had a blanket policy of not hiring anyone with a criminal record, they would have to change this policy and remove any language on the job application that says people with convictions will not be hired. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153456"></a>What is the difference between an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint and a Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) complaint?</h3><p class="text">The EEOC is the federal civil rights agency that enforces federal civil rights law. The DFEH is the state civil rights agency that enforces California civil rights law.Federal and state civil rights laws are very similar. This means that in most cases, you can file a discrimination complaint with either the EEOC or the DFEH. Once you file a complaint with one agency, that agency will investigate your complaint and will ALSO send a copy of your complaint to the other agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-1867" id="footnote-ref-1867">[1867]</a></sup> This is called “dual filing,” but it is NOT something that you need to worry or about. Once you file a complaint with either the EEOC or DFEH, the agencies will take care of filing it with the other agency on its own, and you will not need to do anything else. However, there are certain situations where it is better to file with one agency than the other. <em>THIS CHART EXPLAINS SOME OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO FILE WITH ONE AGENCY (USUALLY THE DFEH) OVER THE OTHER AGENCY:</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1868" id="footnote-ref-1868">[1868]</a></sup></p><table><tr><td><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">SITUATION</span></p></td><td><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">EXPLANATION</span></p></td><td><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">BETTER AGENCY</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="normal1">How many employees work for the employer?</p></td><td><p class="normal1">EEOC only accepts complaints if the employer has 15 or more employees.<sup><a href="#footnote-1869" id="footnote-ref-1869">[1869]</a></sup>DFEH accepts complaints if the employer has 5 or more employees.<sup><a href="#footnote-1870" id="footnote-ref-1870">[1870]</a></sup></p></td><td><p class="normal1">If the employer has 15 or more employees, you can file with either EEOC or DFEH.If employer has fewer than 15 (but at least 5) employees, you should file with the DFEH.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="normal1">How long ago did the discrimination occur?</p></td><td><p class="normal1">You have 300 days (approximately 10 months) to file a complaint with EEOC.<sup><a href="#footnote-1871" id="footnote-ref-1871">[1871]</a></sup>You have 1 year to file a complaint with DFEH.<sup><a href="#footnote-1872" id="footnote-ref-1872">[1872]</a></sup></p></td><td><p class="normal1">If it has been less than 300 days since the discrimination occurred, you can file with either EEOC or DFEH.If it has been more than 300 days (but less than 1 year) since the discrimination occurred, you should file with the DFEH.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="normal1">What type of discrimination occurred?</p></td><td><p class="normal1">In most cases, EEOC and DFEH cover the same types of discrimination.

Some EEOC offices may also have walk-in times when you can file a complaint without an appointment. Check with the local office to find out if this is available. (For a list of local EEOC offices and contact information, see Appendix L, PG. 698.)When you go to the EEOC office, bring any information or papers that are related to your situation. For example, you might bring a copy of the job posting or application, any letters or documents you received from the employer, notes that you took about discriminatory statements made by the employer, or a list of other people who know about what happened. You can also bring anyone you want to come with you, such as a friend, translator, or anyone else to provide assistance or support.</p><h4 class="sidebox">What if the EEOC dismisses my complaint right away? </h4><p class="sidebox">If your complaint was not filed within the time limit, or if the EEOC decides that your situation is not covered by Title VII, the EEOC will dismiss your complaint (close your case) right away. The EEOC may also dismiss your complaint right away if it decides that it probably will not be able to prove discrimination. If your charge is dismissed, you will be notified.<span class="emphasisitalic">Important:</span> Even if the EEOC dismisses your complaint, you may still be able to file a complaint with the DFEH for the same discrimination. </p><p class="text">At the EEOC office, you will meet with an EEOC representative and complete a questionnaire to provide information about the job discrimination you experienced. The representative will ask you for details about your experience, the employer, and when and where the discrimination occurred, and will decide whether Title VII covers your situation. If so, the EEOC representative will explain the process for filing a formal complaint, called a "Charge of Discrimination," and will help you to write up and file the complaint if you want to go forward. (If Title VII does not cover your situation, the EEOC will give you information about where you can go for help, but you will not be able to file an EEOC complaint.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1875" id="footnote-ref-1875">[1875]</a></sup></p><h4>By Mail:</h4><p class="text">You can file a complaint by writing a letter to the EEOC that includes the following information:</p><ol class="text">Your name, address, and telephone number;The name, address and telephone number of the employer whom you want to file your charge against; How many employees work there (if you know this information);A description of the actions that you believe were discriminatory (for example, you were fired, demoted, harassed, or not hired);Why you believe you were discriminated against (for example, the employer hired other people with a similar criminal history, or did not require background checks for other applicants, or gave other applicants a chance to explain their conviction record; or the employer made biased comments);When the events took place; andYour signature (Important: The EEOC cannot investigate your complaint unless you sign the letter!).<sup><a href="#footnote-1876" id="footnote-ref-1876">[1876]</a></sup>You can also include additional information or documents, such as copies of the job posting or application or names and contact information of other people who know what happened or have information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1877" id="footnote-ref-1877">[1877]</a></sup> (Important: If you are sending documents, make sure you make a copy first—keep the original for yourself and send the copy to the EEOC.)</ol><p class="text">You can mail your letter or deliver it in person to the nearest EEOC office.

Then your complaint will be given to an EEOC investigator for investigation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1880" id="footnote-ref-1880">[1880]</a></sup></p><h4 class="step">Investigation. </h4><p class="text">How the EEOC investigates a complaint depends on the specific facts of your case and the kinds of information that will be helpful. In some cases, an EEOC representative may visit the employer, interview other employees or witnesses, and gather documents. The EEOC may also interview you again, or ask you for more documents or information. It’s very important to cooperate and keep in touch with the EEOC! </p><h4 class="step">Decision. </h4><p class="text">After the investigation is completed, the EEOC will issue a decision to let you and the employer know the results. The decision will say either:</p><ol class="text">NO CAUSE—meaning the EEOC did NOT find any evidence that the employer illegally discriminated against you; orREASONABLE CAUSE—meaning the EEOC thinks the employer DID illegally discriminate against you.</ol><h4 class="step">Your Options After the EEOC Decision. </h4><p class="text">Depending on what the EEOC decision says, these are your options:</p><ol class="text">NO CAUSE decision—The EEOC will send you a Right-to-Sue notice, which allows you to file a lawsuit in court against the employer on your own. You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) after receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late. REASONABLE CAUSE decision—The EEOC will try to reach a voluntary settlement (called “conciliation”) with the employer. Conciliation usually means that the employer agrees to pay you to cover the harm from the discrimination. If the EEOC can’t reach a settlement with the employer, the EEOC may decide to file a lawsuit against the employer on your behalf. If the EEOC decides not to file a lawsuit, it will give you a Right-to-Sue notice, which allows you to file a lawsuit against the employer on your own. You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) of receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late.<sup><a href="#footnote-1881" id="footnote-ref-1881">[1881]</a></sup></ol><p class="text">For more information about each of these steps, see Appendix O, PG. 701.</p><a id="_Toc448153460"></a><h3>How do I file a complaint with the DFEH?</h3><h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4><p class="sidebox">Even though you can’t go straight to court, you can still talk to a legal aid or employment attorney, or non-profit employment advocacy organization to get advice about your situation.

You can submit an initial application and find out ahead of time whether you will be able to get a license, before you go through any training or pay any fees.<span class="emphasisitalic">Note</span>: You will still have to complete all of the training and examination requirements, in order to get your actual license.</p><p class="text">When you apply for a professional license, the licensing board can see your entire record—including convictions that have been “expunged.” (Note: Regular employers generally CANNOT see expunged convictions—but licensing boards are different.) However, the board cannot deny your licenses based ONLY on the fact that you have a conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1898" id="footnote-ref-1898">[1898]</a></sup>Beyond criminal history information, licensing boards MUST also consider <em>mitigating and rehabilitative evidence</em>. <em>Mitigating evidence</em> is information that would make the board judge a conviction less harshly, and could be information like youth, drug addiction, duress, or other factors that were going on at the time of the offense. <em>Rehabiliative evidence</em> is proof of your efforts to change and improve yourself, demonstrating that you are no longer at risk of the conduct or circumstances that led to your past system involvement. You can submit this evidence at the time of your application, and on appeal.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153472"></a>Can a licensing board deny me a license based on my record?</h3><p class="text">The licensing board can deny your application for a license based on a criminal conviction, but ONLY if your conviction is <strong>“substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the business or profession.”</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1899" id="footnote-ref-1899">[1899]</a></sup> This legal standard means that the type of conduct you were convicted for—for example, theft, selling drugs, violence, or fraud—creates a high risk of harm, or otherwise prevents you from safely completing the specific tasks and responsibilities of the job that you want a license for. For example, a conviction for drug distribution might be considered “substantially related” to a pharmacist license, since pharmacists have access to lots of drugs and are responsibility for safely providing drugs to other people.<sup><a href="#footnote-1900" id="footnote-ref-1900">[1900]</a></sup><strong><em>PLEASE NOTE:</em></strong><em> </em>Some crimes, such as those involving physical violence or fraud, dishonesty and deceit, are <em>presumed</em> to be “substantially related” to any profession regulated by the California Business &amp; Profession Code (including medical, law, construction, and real estate licenses).<sup><a href="#footnote-1901" id="footnote-ref-1901">[1901]</a></sup>In addition to actual convictions, a licensing board is also allowed to consider <strong>“any act involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit” that you have done “with the intent to substantially benefit” yourself or someone else, or “substantially injure another.” </strong>However, as with convictions, the act must also be “substantially related” to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the job.<sup><a href="#footnote-1902" id="footnote-ref-1902">[1902]</a></sup> </p><h3 class="subheading3">Mitigating &amp; Rehabilitative Evidence for Licensing Boards:</h3><p class="text">Even if the licensing board determines that your conviction is “substantially related” to the qualifications of your chosen profession, California law <em>requires</em> that the board also consider any <strong>evidence of rehabilitation or other positive factors</strong> that you present. Each licensing board <strong>must</strong> create its own criteria to evaluate your rehabilitation efforts.<sup><a href="#footnote-1903" id="footnote-ref-1903">[1903]</a></sup> <strong>Although each board is different, most focus on the following rehabilitative factors:<sup><a href="#footnote-1904" id="footnote-ref-1904">[1904]</a></sup> </strong>The amount of time that has passed since your conviction; whether you successfully completed parole or probation; whether you have shown remorse; your change in attitude; alcohol or drug counseling;your pursuit of education or vocational training;the stability of your family life; and your community involvement.<strong>In addition:</strong></p><ol class="text">If the state of California has given you a <strong>Certificate of Rehabilitation</strong> (see more on PG. 1078), then a licensing board CANNOT deny you a professional license based solely on your conviction.For professions governed by the California Business &amp; Professions Code, a licensing board also CANNOT deny you for (1) having a misdemeanor if you have met all of the board’s rehabilitative critera, or (2) for a felony that has been dismissed (“expunged”).<sup><a href="#footnote-1905" id="footnote-ref-1905">[1905]</a></sup> (Many of the individual board’s rehabilitative criteria can be found in the California Code of Regulations.)</ol><h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSIf you prepared for your license while incarcerated…</h4><p class="textbox">Many people are able to learn new job skills or complete professional license requirements while incarcerated. In the past, licensing boards were allowed to delay or deny your license application just because you had completed the licensing requirements while incarcerated. But now, a new California law makes it <strong>illegal</strong> for a licensing board to delay or deny your license based solely on the fact that you completed some or all of the licensure requirements while incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-1906" id="footnote-ref-1906">[1906]</a></sup> If you otherwise qualify for the license, it no longer matters that you were incarcerated when you prepared for it.<span class="emphasisheavy">IMPORTANT:</span> The new law does NOT change any other rules about whether you can get a license. A licensing board CAN still deny you a license based on your conviction, if they determine that the conviction is “substantially related” to the qualifications and duties of the job. Also, the law does NOT change any rules about <em>when</em> you can apply and whether you can apply while you’re still incarcerated. </p><a id="_Toc448153473"></a><h3>Can I apply for a license while I’m still incarcerated?</h3><h4 class="sidebox">Special program for getting your cosmetology license while incarcerated</h4><p class="sidebox">If you are incarcerated at Valley State Prison, California Women’s Institute, or Central California Women’s Facility (Chowchilla), there is a special program that can help you to get your cosmetology license while you’re incarcerated. You can complete your training school AND take the licensing examination in these facilities—meaning it is possible to already have your license in hand by the time you’re released.IMPORTANT: This program does NOT stop the licensing board from considering your criminal conviction, and does NOT change any of the other qualifications to get your license. In other words, the licensing board can still deny you a license if the board decides that your conviction is substantially related to the duties and responsibilities of a cosmetologist. </p><p class="text">It depends.<strong> </strong>Each licensing board has different rules and requirements.

Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, freedom and flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibility within the workplace. It also gives you more legal and business responsibilities, such as managing money and product, paying taxes, marketing your business and supervising employees.There are many resources available for people who want to start a business—good places to start are your local library, the Internet, or classes at a local community college or adult school. Also, many non-profit organizations and government agencies now offer assistance to people who want to start their own business. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, you’ll find a list of organizations and other resources for starting your own business in Appendix R, PG. 707.</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153481"></a>Become an independent contractor</h1><p class="text">Being an independent contractor is a form of self-employment somewhere between being an employee and running your own business. Employers usually hire independent contractors to do specific tasks or short-term jobs—like painting a house, installing plumbing, or doing landscaping work. The job usually ends automatically once the task is finished, although the employer can always hire the independent contractor again for another task. The BIG difference between independent contractors and employees is that, under the law, independent contractors are considered to be self-employed. This means that independent contractors have more control over the work they choose to do. They also have legal responsibilities—like filing self-employment taxes and reporting certain business information to the government—and fewer legal rights in the workplace. On the other hand, employees have more legal rights and protections in the workplace, but the employer gets to control the work they do.</p><p class="importantbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: <em>Am I an independent contractor or employees? </em>In some cases, an employer may call you an independent contractor, even though you are ACTUALLY an employee. The difference between an employee and an independent contractor is important, because you have more rights (and the employer has more responsibilities) if you are an employee; and you have fewer rights (and the employer has fewer responsibilities) if you are an independent contractor.Sometimes an employer will get this wrong by accident, but other times an employer may misclassify you on purpose in order to avoid fulfilling their duties under law. According to the law, whether you are an employee or an independent contractor depends on the specific details of your work situation—NOT on what the employer calls you. For this reason, it’s important that you know the difference so that you don’t get taken advantage of! For more information on the difference between independent contractors and employees, and your rights and responsibilities in each situation, see the Appendix S, PG. 709.</p><h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSWhat can I do if I think an employer has wrongly classified me as an independent contractor OR violated my rights as an employee?</h4><p class="textbox">The California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) is the state agency responsible for enforcing your rights in the workplace. If you think an employer has violated your rights as an employee, wrongly classified you as an independent contractor, and/or for more information, you can contact your local DLSE office and speak with Deputy Labor Commissioner.

In other words, the workers are both the employees AND the employer. Usually, workers run the day-to-day operations of the business—such as making business decisions, assigning tasks to each person, etc., as well as the business’s finances. Although each person has a different level of responsibility, all workers are considered to be equal members and have equal power within the business.Any business can be a worker-owned and controlled cooperative. Worker co-ops have been successful in many different industries. Some examples are:</p><ol class="text">Service—housecleaning, day labor, restaurants, taxis, childcareFarming and food production—urban or community farms, community-supported agriculture programs, bakeries, restaurantsRetail—grocery stores, bookstores, bike shopsHealth care—nursing, home health care, clinics, bodyworkSkilled trades—printing, plumbing, woodworking, contractingManufacturing and engineering—machine parts, fabricatingTechnology—web hosting, networking, voice and data systemsEducation—charter schools, teacher/student/parent-run schoolsMedia and the arts—designers, galleries, performers, publishers</ol><p class="text">For more information about worker cooperatives and how to join or start a cooperative near you, here are some helpful resources:</p><ol class="text">U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives—Democracy at Work Institute: <a href="http://institute.usworker.coop/">http://institute.usworker.coop/</a>Sustainable Economies Law Center: <a href="http://www.theselc.org/cooperatives">http://www.theselc.org/cooperatives</a>Examples of existing worker cooperatives: <a href="http://institute.usworker.coop/examples-worker-cooperatives">http://institute.usworker.coop/examples-worker-cooperatives</a></ol><a id="_Toc448153483"></a><h1 class="subheading">Apply to work through a temp agency</h1><h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4><p class="sidebox">Talk to someone from a local reentry or workforce development program for advice about finding a good temp agency and what to expect. </p><p class="text">Temp agencies (also called staffing agencies) help match people who are looking for work with employers who want to hire them. Temp agencies can often help you to find a short-term job or part-time job quickly, which, in some cases, can get your foot in the door for a permanent position in the future. In addition, some temp agencies specifically focus on helping people with criminal records get jobs, and they work with employers who are open to hiring applicants with criminal records. Another benefit of going through to a temp agency is that once you apply to the agency, they can place you in jobs with many different employers who want to hire. Applying to a temp agency is similar to applying for a job directly with the employer—it will likely include an interview, checking your references, and possibly even doing a background check. The temp agency may also have you take an assessment test to evaluate your work strengths and skills. It still can be easier to apply through a temp agency rather than an employer, because most agencies always want to increase their pool of employees to choose from, and employers often prefer to hire temp workers because it’s cheaper.If you’re interested in applying to a temp agency, here are some things to keep in mind: </p><ol class="text">Not all temp agencies are the same! Just like employers, some temp agencies are better to work for than others. Ask around to find a temp agency that treats employees well and has a good record of placing people in jobs. Some things to ask about are: how long people usually have to wait before getting placed with an employer; how long most jobs last; what employers the temp agency works with; whether the agency places many people with criminal records; and how the agency treats people.Different temp agencies may focus on different types of jobs or different industries. Each temp agency is different, so the application requirements and process may be different from one agency to another. If there are several different temp agencies available in your area, do your homework to find out which one is right for you. When you apply through a temp agency, you will have to sign a contract with the agency that makes you an employee. Any offers of work that you get, either temporary or permanent, must go through the agency. The contract may even prohibit you from looking for work on the side, outside of the agency. If you want to look for other work on your own, you may need to ask the agency to release you from your contract. Before you sign up with a temp agency, it is recommended that you read all the fine print and ask questions about anything you don’t fully understand!The temp agency is responsible for paying the employees who they send to work for an employer. The employer will pay the temp agency—NOT the employee—for the work, and then the agency takes a cut of the money and gives the rest to the employee. For example, if the employer pays the temp agency $20/hour for each employee, the agency may keep $5/hour of pay and then pay the employee $15/hour.Beware of any temp agency that charges you a fee for job placement! Most agencies collect their fees from the employer—NOT from the job applicant or employee.</ol><p class="text">For more information about applying for jobs through a temp agency, here are some resources:</p><ol class="text">How Temp Agencies Work—<a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/business/getting-a-job/temp-agencies.htm">http://money.howstuffworks.com/business/getting-a-job/temp-agencies.htm</a> Working for Temp Agencies—Pros &amp; Cons of Temping—<a href="http://www.moneycrashers.com/working-temp-agencies-temping/">http://www.moneycrashers.com/working-temp-agencies-temping/</a>How Do Temp Agencies Work? 9 Tips You Can’t Afford to Miss—<a href="http://www.jobunlocker.com/blog/how-do-temp-agencies-work-9-tips-you-cant-afford-to-miss/">http://www.jobunlocker.com/blog/how-do-temp-agencies-work-9-tips-you-cant-afford-to-miss/</a></ol><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153484"></a>Take short-term jobs or temporary positions to get your foot in the door</h1><p class="text">If an employer seems uncertain about hiring you, ask if they would give you the opportunity to prove yourself by starting work in a short-term, part-time, or temporary position, or for a test period. This gives you a chance to show the employer that you are a hard worker, and that you can work safely and responsibly. It can also help get your foot in the door for a long-term job afterward. If you do well during the testing period, you can ask the employer to consider hiring you for a permanent or full-time job, or at least to keep you in mind if a permanent job opens up in the future.If you’re participating in a workforce development program or have enrolled at an America’s Job Center, you can also ask whether they have any special programs that let you get paid for doing on-the-job training or getting work experience with an employer. These programs are great because they help you to develop your job skills, get training, and practice working for an employer—and get paid at the same time! In addition, these programs can sometimes turn into longer-term employment afterward, because an employer may be more willing to hire you once you prove yourself in training.<sup><a href="#footnote-1921" id="footnote-ref-1921">[1921]</a></sup> </p><h2><a id="ED_ProtectYourRights_Disability"></a><a id="_Toc448153485"></a>HOW TO PROTECT YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY</h2><a id="_Toc448153486"></a><h1 class="subheading">Disability &amp; reasonable accommodations in employment</h1><h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN? </h4><ul class="learn-bullets">What is considered a disability under the lawHow your disability might affect your job searchWhat a “reasonable accommodation” is, and what kinds of accommodations you can requestHow to request a “reasonable accommodation,” and what you will need to showWhen an employer is NOT required to provide a “reasonable accommodation” for your disabilityWhat to do if an employer refuses to provide a “reasonable accommodation” How to learn more about your employment rights and your disability</ul><p class="text">This section will explain the laws that protect workers (including job applicants and employees) with disabilities against employment discrimination.

At least 2 federal courts have agreed that employers can be required to provide reasonably accommodations for employees whose workplace violations were caused by prior substance abuse, after the employees had later completed rehab programs. See more examples of reasonable accommodations during the job search, and when you apply, on PG. 667.If you have suffered from one of the conditions listed above, it is possible that your criminal conviction(s) may have been the result of your disability—in other words, you committed the offense because of your mental illness or past drug or alcohol addiction. </p><a id="EM_ReasonableAccommodations_Example"></a><a id="_Toc448153490"></a><h3>What kinds of accommodations can I request?</h3><h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4><p class="sidebox">You can also have someone else talk to the employer for you, to ask for the accommodation you need. In this case, you may want to ask your case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or another trusted person who is helping you with your job search, to speak with the employer on your behalf.</p><p class="text">You can request any accommodation that is reasonable and necessary so that you can be considered for the job like any other applicant or perform the job like any other employee. Each situation is different, so the type of accommodation you request will depend on your particular circumstances and the type of work or employer involved. These are just a few examples of accommodations you may request:</p><ol class="text">Making an exception to a hiring or employment policy that restricts applicants/employees with certain types of convictions;Disregarding a conviction caused by your disability;Considering your conviction under an easier standard;Giving you an opportunity to explain your conviction and provide additional (medical) evidence of your disability and rehabilitation;Giving you time off to attend treatment programs;Disregarding workplace violations caused by your disability.</ol><p class="text">The employer is not necessarily required to provide the exact accommodation that you ask for—but MUST provide an accommodation that has the same effect.<sup><a href="#footnote-1930" id="footnote-ref-1930">[1930]</a></sup> For example, the employer might be allowed to rearrange your work schedule—rather than give you time off—so that you can attend treatment programs.</p><p class="importantbox">EXCEPTIONS: There are 3 situations where an employer is NOT required to provide a reasonable accommodation for your disability: 1) where the accommodation will cause the employer “Undue Hardship,” 2) where the reasonable accommodation would present a “Direct Threat” to the safety of others or property, or 3) where the employer shows that you CANNOT safely perform essential job functions. For more information about these exceptions, see Appendix U, PG. 713</p><p class="text">After you request a reasonable accommodation, the employer has to genuinely consider your request, and talk to you about what types of accommodations could help your situation. The employer can also ask you for more information about your disability to help with the decision. An employer CANNOT simply ignore your request OR wait an unreasonable amount of time to respond, hoping that you give up.<sup><a href="#footnote-1931" id="footnote-ref-1931">[1931]</a></sup>If an employer decides NOT to hire you based on you disability, the employer MUST give you a chance to get a medical opinion about your condition from an independent doctor.

This meansExplaining to the employer that you have a disability and what the disability is; ANDProviding any documents you have regarding your disability and treatment, including:Letters from doctors or service providers (a) saying that you experienced drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, and/or some other disability at the time of the offense, and (b) describing how your disability affected you;Letters from doctors or service providers showing that you successful completed a rehabilitation program or are participating in effective ongoing treatment of your mental illness or other disability;Letters from doctors or service providers that show you are no longer using substances and/or you are receiving appropriate treatment to control the symptoms of your mental illness or other disability.</ol><p class="textbox">REMEMBER: It may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was caused by your drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, or other disability. It is important that you submit as much evidence as possible! It’s best if you can have a doctor submit a letter confirming that you have a disability and how it affects you.</p><ol class="text">The accommodation that you’re asking for is “reasonable” and “necessary.” This means showing that—The change is necessary for you to apply for or work at the job on an equal basis with other applicants or employees—for example, if the employer does not make an accommodation, your application would be rejected due to your conviction history;It’s not too expensive or burdensome for the employer to make the change;It doesn’t fundamentally change the employer’s business operations;There is a relationship between your disability and the change you are requesting—in other words, you are only asking for an exception for the specific convictions that were caused by your disability, NOT other, unrelated convictions that you might have.<sup> </sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1933" id="footnote-ref-1933">[1933]</a></sup></ol><p class="text">For more information about requesting a reasonable accommodation, see Appendix U, PG. 713.

However, you will still have to file a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH first, before you are allowed to file a lawsuit in court against the employer. For this reason, it’s important that you contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately, and then you can also talk to an attorney.</p><p class="textbox">BUT REMEMBER: Just because you committed a criminal offense when you were suffering from a mental illness or a past drug addiction does not mean you automatically have the right to a reasonable accommodation on your job application today. It can be very difficult to prove that your disability caused your criminal offense, AND that the disability is the type that qualifies you for a reasonable accommodation. Although these reasonable accommodation requests can be difficult, it can be worth asking for them!Remember, just like with other discrimination complaints, you only have 300 days to file a complaint with the EEOC, or 1 year to file a complaint with the DFEH! For more information about finding a legal aid or employment attorney or non-profit organization, see PG. 651 above. For more information about filing a lawsuit, see PG. 669 below.</p><p class="text">If you believe that an employer denied your request for a reasonable accommodation due to your disability and/or your past drug use, you can file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (federal employment protection agency) or with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (the state employment protection agency).<sup><a href="#footnote-1934" id="footnote-ref-1934">[1934]</a></sup> The complaint process is the SAME for disability discrimination (an employer’s refusal to provide reasonable accommodations) as for other types of illegal discrimination based on your criminal record (e.g., discrimination based on your race, religion, sex, national origin, etc.). See PG. 646 for more information on filing a discrimination complaint with the EEOC or the DFEH and what to expect. Even if you want to want to file a lawsuit against the employer, you will still have to file a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH first.

Take responsibility for your actions. State the facts, but express regret for what happened. Don’t get defensive. Don’t go into details. Keep your answers short. Be honest, but only talk about necessary information based on the questions you are asked.Tell the employer how you have changed. Emphasize that the incident happened long ago and that you are a different person now. Explain what you learned while you were in prison/jail, and what you are doing differently now. Highlight any services that you’re getting to help you move on. Paint a picture of the person you are now. Emphasize your qualifications. Describe the things that will make you a good employee—such as previous work experience, job training programs, or classes that you’ve taken. Show the employer why you are qualified for the position and will be a benefit to the company.Describe your hopes and dreams. Show the employer than you are in control of your life and have short-term and long-term goals. Highlight any programs or services that you’re participating in to help you move on and achieve your goals. Emphasize that you would be very appreciative of the opportunity to work for them, and you will be the hardest worker they will ever have.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1941" id="footnote-ref-1941">[1941]</a></sup></sup> DON’T LIE!

Be sure you have all of these answers prepared and practice them beforehand. IMPORTANT: What if the employer asks an illegal question or asks about something that should not have been included in your background check? See PG. 615 for more information about what you can do in this situation.</p><h4 class="step">Ask your own questions.</h4><p class="text">Often, employers will give you a chance to ask them questions at the end of an interview, so it’s best to have several questions prepared beforehand. Here are some sample questions you can ask that demonstrate your interest in the position and the company—the answers will make you look better!</p><ol class="text">What is most important for you (my boss) to be happy with me if I get this job?What would you like me to accomplish in the first couple of weeks on the job?Why did the person who had this job before leave?<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1942" id="footnote-ref-1942">[1942]</a></sup></sup> Any other questions showing that you’ve done your homework to research and learn about the company.DON’T just ask about wages, hours, or benefits!</ol><h4 class="step">Practice beforehand!</h4><p class="text">If possible, you should try to do a practice (“mock”) interview before the real thing with your case manager, social worker, counselor, or family or friends. Have the other person pretend they’re the employer and ask you interview questions, so that you can practice giving your answers. Remember, even if you have your answers prepared on paper or in your head, things will sound different when you try to say them out loud!</p><h4 class="step">Be polite and confident during the interview.</h4><p class="text">Here are some things to keep in mind when it’s time for the interview:</p><ol class="text">Dress up! Show the employer that you take yourself—and the job—seriously by presenting your most professional self. Dress like you were going to court, to church, or to some other important event.Be polite! Make sure to thank the employer for giving you the chance to interview for the job, and shake the interviewer’s hand. Do this BEFORE and AFTER the interview.Be positive and confident! Smile, make eye contact with the interviewer, and show that you are confident in your abilities to be a good employee. Go in with the mindset that you are the best applicant for the job and you will get hired.Take notes! Bring a pencil and paper so that you can write down any important information or questions during the interview. Always start by writing down the interviewer’s name so that you can follow up afterward!</ol><h4 class="step">Follow-up after the interview.</h4><p class="text">After the interview, it’s important to follow up—this will help to make sure the employer doesn’t forget about you and shows you’re still interested in the job.</p><ol class="text">Send a thank you note. A thank-you note will help you stand out from other job applicants. It shows how professional and polite you are, and it gives you another opportunity to sell yourself or re-answer a question that you didn’t handle very well during the interview. Address the note to the person who interviewed you (this is why it’s important to write down their name during the interview).If you don’t get the job, you might consider calling the hiring manager to ask for feedback. You could say something along the lines of: “I know you decided to hire someone else, but I just wanted to find out why I didn’t get the job. I’d appreciate knowing the reason, because your feedback will help me in my job search.” You may get feedback that could actually influence the employer to reconsider your application. If not, you’ll at least receive some useful information that will help with future interviews.<sup><a href="#footnote-1943" id="footnote-ref-1943">[1943]</a></sup> </ol><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_E_FederalBondingProgram"></a>Appendix E</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppE"></a>Benefits for Employers: <br />Federal Bonding Program</div><p class="text">This section explains all the eligibility requirements of the Federal Bonding Program and how to apply for the program.<span class="emphasisitalic">WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL BONDING PROGRAM? </span>In order to be eligible for the federal bonding program, you must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Have a firm job offer (or be already employed) at a job that is likely to be long-term or permanent.

As of July 1, 2014, state and local agencies can’t ask about your criminal history by any method—verbally (e.g., during an interview), in writing, or on a job application—until after it has decided that you meet the minimum qualifications for the job.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1951" id="footnote-ref-1951">[1951]</a></sup></sup> WHO DOES THE STATEWIDE “BAN THE BOX” LAW APPLY TO?

However, LOCAL laws might provide more protection for applicants. See more below. WHAT EXTRA PROTECTIONS EXIST IN CERTAIN COUNTIES AND CITIES? Certain cities and counties throughout California have passed their own local “Ban the Box” laws. Some of these local laws give more protection to job applicants with criminal records than the state law does.

In general, OLSE will NOT force an employer to hire someone, even if the employer violated the law by rejecting you for the job. However, OLSE has been very successful at resolving violations informally, simply by talking with the employer and applicant. For example, OLSE might ask the employer to reconsider your application, give you the opportunity to apply for another job, or let you submit a new application without prejudice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1962" id="footnote-ref-1962">[1962]</a></sup></p><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_H_BanTheBox_Richmond"></a>Appendix H</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppH"></a>City of Richmond, CA:<br />“Ban the Box” Ordinance</div><p class="text">If you are applying to a job with a company located or doing business in the City of Richmond, read this section!</p><h4><em>What is the City of Richmond’s local “ban the box” ordinance?</em></h4><p class="text">It is a law (a city ordinance) that prevents certain types of employers—all contractors and subcontractors getting money from the City of Richmond, with at 10 or more full-time employees—from asking about criminal convictions in the initial job application.<sup><a href="#footnote-1963" id="footnote-ref-1963">[1963]</a></sup></p><h4><em>What does the ordinance require/prohibit? </em></h4><p class="text">The Richmond “Ban the Box” law prohibits these types of employers (city-paid contractors and subcontractors) from asking any questions regarding prior criminal convictions on any printed or online employment application forms.

This includes federal, state, and local governments; private and public colleges and universities; employment agencies; and labor organizations (unions).<sup><a href="#footnote-1967" id="footnote-ref-1967">[1967]</a></sup></p><h4>WHAT IS CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF TITLE VII?</h4><p class="text">Title VII violations can occur in two situations: where there is disparate treatment (unequal treatment) OR where there is disparate impact (unequal impact).<span class="emphasisitalic">Disparate Treatment Discrimination (Unequal Treatment):</span> An employer might be engaging in <em>disparate treatment discrimination</em> if they treat you and your criminal history differently than they treat other applicants with similar criminal records, because of your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. For example, if an employer rejects a Black applicant based on his/her criminal record, but then hires a White applicant with similar qualifications and a similar criminal record, the employer is likely violating Title VII by illegally treating one person’s criminal history more negatively because of his/her race. Similarly, an employer may be violating Title VII if they only do background checks for Black or Latino applicants, but do not run background checks on White applicants for the same position.<span class="emphasisitalic">Disparate Impact Discrimination (Unequal Impact):</span>An employer might be engaging in <em>disparate impact discrimination</em> if they have a policy of not hiring people with certain kinds of criminal histories, and that policy is more harmful to people of a certain race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. For example, employers who have a “blanket ban” policy that excludes all applicants with criminal records would cause greater harm to Black and Latino applicants, who are incarcerated at dramatically higher rates than people of other races in the United States. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1968" id="footnote-ref-1968">[1968]</a></sup></sup> However, an employer may legally exclude certain job applicants based on their criminal history if the employer shows that doing so is necessary for the specific position and business.</p><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_K_EEOC"></a>Appendix K</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppK"></a>Civil Rights Law that Governs Employers’ Hiring Decisions:<br />EEOC Enforcement Guidance </div><p class="text">This section will explain the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the EEOC Enforcement Guidance. The EEOC is the federal government agency responsible for enforcing the civil rights of job applicants and employees. The EEOC Enforcement Guidance is a report that explains how and when employers can consider your criminal record when deciding whether to hire or fire you. </p><h4>WHAT IS THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION (EEOC)? </h4><p class="text">The EEOC is a government agency that enforces Title VII and other civil rights laws that prohibit illegal discrimination against job applicants and employees. These laws protect you against unfair treatment based on your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1969" id="footnote-ref-1969">[1969]</a></sup> California law requires employers to fully follow all federal laws regarding how employers can consider your criminal history when hiring. This means that all employers must follow the EEOC guidelines, or else they have broken both federal and state law.<sup><a href="#footnote-1970" id="footnote-ref-1970">[1970]</a></sup></p><h4>WHAT IS EEOC ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE? </h4><p class="text">The EEOC investigates claims of discrimination by employers, and also issues special guidelines and “enforcement guidance” reports for employers to help them follow Title VII and other civil rights laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-1971" id="footnote-ref-1971">[1971]</a></sup> The EEOC’s Enforcement Guidance is a report that describes how and when employers can use your criminal record to make employment decisions. The Enforcement Guidance says that—before making any negative decision based on your record, such as rejecting your job application—an employer must consider the nature of your conviction, the type of job you’ve applied for, and how much time has passed since the conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1972" id="footnote-ref-1972">[1972]</a></sup> The employer should also consider your individual situation and give you a chance to explain yourself, including the circumstances of your conviction and why you would still be a good employee.<sup><a href="#footnote-1973" id="footnote-ref-1973">[1973]</a></sup> However, the Enforcement Guidance does NOT have the same power as an actual law—it is basically a set of recommended rules for how employers <em>should</em> act and how courts <em>should</em> enforce the law. Courts should consider the Enforcement Guidance and may be persuaded to follow the EEOC’s recommendations, but they are not required to follow these rules.

When you file your complaint, the EEOC will give you a copy of the complaint, along with your charge number (which is the number used to identify your case).</p><h4 class="step">Notice to the Employer &amp; Mediation. </h4><p class="text">Within 10 days, the EEOC will also send a notice and a copy of the charge to the employer. The EEOC may ask both you and the employer to agree to participate in mediation, which is an informal way of trying to resolve the problem instead of filing a lawsuit.<strong> What happens in mediation?</strong> Mediation is an informal way for people to resolve problems with the help of a neutral person (a mediator) who is trained to help people discuss their differences. If you and the employer agree to<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/mediation.cfm"> </a>mediation, the mediator will try to help you both reach a voluntary resolution (settlement agreement). The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or make a decision about your complaint. Instead, the mediator helps you and the employer work out your own solution to the problem. Everything that happens in mediation is confidential and free. Mediation can also be a faster way of resolving the dispute, since it usually takes less than 3 months to settle a complaint through mediation. If you and the employer cannot reach an agreement, the EEOC will continue to investigate your case just like any other.<sup><a href="#footnote-1974" id="footnote-ref-1974">[1974]</a></sup></p><h4 class="step">Employer’s Response. </h4><p class="text">If your case is not sent to mediation, or if mediation doesn’t resolve the problem, the EEOC will ask the employer to respond (submit a written answer) to your complaint, and answer any questions that the EEOC has about your complaint. Then your complaint will be given to an EEOC investigator for investigation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1975" id="footnote-ref-1975">[1975]</a></sup></p><h4 class="step">Investigation. </h4><p class="text">How the EEOC investigates a complaint depends on the specific facts of your case and the kinds of information that will be helpful. In some cases, an EEOC representative may visit the employer, interview other employees or witnesses, gather documents, and/or take other steps to find out whether the employer committed illegal discrimination. The EEOC may also interview you again, or ask you for other documents or information—so it’s very important to cooperate and keep in touch! <strong>How long will the investigation take?</strong> How long the investigation takes depends on a lot of different things, including the amount of information that the EEOC needs to get and evaluate. It may take up to 6 months or longer to investigate a charge.<sup><a href="#footnote-1976" id="footnote-ref-1976">[1976]</a></sup> <strong>What if the employer refuses to cooperate with the investigation?</strong> If an employer refuses to cooperate with an EEOC investigation, the EEOC can issue a subpoena (legal order) that requires the employer to turn over documents and information and/or answer legal questions, and allows the EEOC to enter the employer’s facilities.</p><h4 class="step">Decision. </h4><p class="text">After the investigation is completed, the EEOC will issue a decision, and let you and the employer know the results. The decision will say either:</p><ol class="text">NO CAUSE—meaning the EEOC did NOT find any evidence that the employer illegally discriminated against you; orREASONABLE CAUSE—meaning the EEOC thinks the employer DID illegally discriminate against you.</ol><h4 class="step">Your Options After the EEOC Decision. </h4><p class="text">Depending on what the EEOC decision says, these are your options:</p><ol class="text">NO CAUSE decision—If the EEOC does NOT find that the employer illegally discriminated against you, it will send you a Right-to-Sue notice. This notice allows you to file a lawsuit in court against the employer on your own. (However, it may be difficult to win in court without the EEOC’s support.) You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) of receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late. REASONABLE CAUSE decision—If the EEOC finds that the employer DID illegally discriminate against you, it will first try to reach a voluntary settlement (called “conciliation”) with the employer. Conciliation usually means that the employer agrees to pay you to cover the harm from the discrimination.If the EEOC can’t reach a settlement with the employer, the EEOC’s lawyers may decide to file a lawsuit against the employer on your behalf. If the EEOC decides not to file a lawsuit, it will give you a Right-to-Sue notice, which allows you to file a lawsuit against the employer on your own. You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) of receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late.<sup><a href="#footnote-1977" id="footnote-ref-1977">[1977]</a></sup></ol><p class="widetableintroitalcaps">This chart summarizes what happens at the end of an EEOC investigation:</p><table><tr><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">EEOC Decision</p></td><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">What it means</p></td><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">What happens next</p></td><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">What your options are</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">No cause</p></td><td><p class="textbox">EEOC does NOT think that the employer illegally discriminated against you</p></td><td><p class="textbox">EEOC gives you Right-to-Sue notice</p></td><td><p class="textbox">You can file a lawsuit against the employer, but you only have 90 days</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="tableheadingmedium">Reasonable cause</p></td><td><p class="textbox">EEOC thinks the employer DID illegally discriminate against you</p></td><td><p class="textbox">1) EEOC tries to settle with employer. 2) If they can’t settle:&gt; EEOC files lawsuit against employer; OR&gt; EEOC gives you Right-to-Sue notice</p></td><td><p class="textbox">If EEOC does NOT settle and does NOT file a lawsuit, you can file a lawsuit against the employer.

The investigator will decide whether state and federal civil rights laws cover your situation. If the DFEH accepts your complaint, the investigator will type up an official complaint for you to sign. If the DFEH does NOT accept your complaint, it does not mean that you weren’t treated unfairly—only that your situation is not covered by the civil rights laws that the DFEH enforces. </p><h5 class="question">Can I go straight to court and file a lawsuit on my own?</h5><p class="address">Under California law (just like Title VII), you must first file a complaint with DFEH before you can go to court (this is called “exhausting your administrative remedies”).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1980" id="footnote-ref-1980">[1980]</a></sup></strong> However, once you file your complaint, you can ask the DFEH for a Right-to-Sue notice right away, which allows you to file a lawsuit in court on your own.

If you do not file a Notice of Defense (or file it late, past the 15 days allowed), you will give up your right to a hearing (called a “default”). The licensing board can take whatever action it pleases, which is usually the harshest, i.e. denial of your license, and you can’t challenge it. (Note: a licensing board has discretion to allow/honor late notices and to grant a hearing after a default, but chances are slim.) Typically a generic notice of default “postcard” is included with the statement. This is the easiest way to preserve your right. The notice of defense need only contain your address and signature to be sufficient.<sup><a href="#footnote-1988" id="footnote-ref-1988">[1988]</a></sup><strong>Written Request for a Hearing:</strong> If the board does not file a formal statement of issues, but instead sends you an informal notice of denial, you have 60 days to file a written request for a hearing with the board. </ol><h4 class="step">Stipulated Settlement.</h4><p class="text">In many cases, you can resolve your case before by agreeing to a voluntary settlement (called a “stipulated settlement”) with the licensing board. A stipulated settlement is sort of like a plea bargain—you admit to doing something wrong, and you agree to accept a certain amount of punishment from the board. Often this means that you will get your license on a conditional basis for a certain amount of time (a “probation” period). You will have to meet certain requirements—such as participating in counseling or other behavioral programs, taking specific classes or exams, having your work monitored by a supervisor, getting drug tested, completing community service, and/or temporary suspension—during the probation period.<sup><a href="#footnote-1989" id="footnote-ref-1989">[1989]</a></sup> If you complete all the requirements, you can get your full license back. If you do NOT complete the requirements, the board can revoke your license.<sup><a href="#footnote-1990" id="footnote-ref-1990">[1990]</a></sup>A stipulated settlement can be complicated, so it is recommended to have a lawyer represent you. You may be able to negotiate certain parts of the settlement agreement—such as what wrongdoing you will admit to; what conditions you will have to complete during the probation period; and how much you will have to pay in recovery costs to get your license. If you reach this point, you should think about what issues are most important to you—for example, whether you want the shortest possible probation, or to pay the smallest amount, or to avoid admitting certain wrongdoing.<sup><a href="#footnote-1991" id="footnote-ref-1991">[1991]</a></sup></p><h4 class="step">The Formal Hearing.</h4><p class="text">If you don’t reach a stipulated settlement with the licensing board, you will have a formal administrative hearing. An administrative hearing is somewhat like a trial. There will be a judge and a court reporter. The board will be represented either by in-house counsel (its own attorney) or the California Attorney General (like a prosecutor for the entire state). You are allowed to have an attorney also, but you are not entitled to one, so you will have to pay for your attorney yourself. Both sides will present evidence, put on witnesses (if necessary), and make arguments. <sup><a href="#footnote-1992" id="footnote-ref-1992">[1992]</a></sup></p><h4 class="step">The Decision. </h4><p class="text">After the case is presented, the administrative law judge (ALJ) will issue an advisory decision within about 30 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-1993" id="footnote-ref-1993">[1993]</a></sup> </p><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_R_SelfEmployment"></a>Appendix R</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppR"></a>Alternatives to Traditional Employment: Self-Employment &amp;<br />Starting Your Own Business</div><p class="text">Many non-profit organizations and government agencies now offer assistance to individuals who want to start their own business.

Sometimes the funding is through grants—money that you do NOT have to repay, but generally must use in a certain way related to the business. More often, the funding is through loans—money that you DO have to repay (usually with interest) in the future.Unfortunately, it can be difficult to get loans depending on your conviction record. One place to start is the U.S. Small Business Administration, which is planning to change its policy to allow people on probation or parole to be eligible for microloans of up to $50,000.<sup><a href="#footnote-1994" id="footnote-ref-1994">[1994]</a></sup> However, you may still be denied if you’ve been convicted of a felony “crime of moral turpitude” (i.e., involving violence or dishonesty).<sup><a href="#footnote-1995" id="footnote-ref-1995">[1995]</a></sup> For this reason, it may be helpful to contact one of the entrepreneurship programs listed to see if they have suggestions or resources to find funding.</p><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_S_IndependentContractor"></a>Appendix S</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppS"></a>Alternatives to Traditional Employment: Becoming an Independent Contractor</div><p class="text">If you’re considering working as an independent contractor, or if you want to know more about the difference between an independent contractor and a traditional employee, you should read this section to understand your rights and responsibilities! </p><h4>EMPLOYEES VS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS—WHAT’s the DIFFERENCE?</h4><p class="text">In some cases, an employer may claim that they are hiring you as an independent contractor—NOT as a regular employee. Employers like to do this this because it means they have fewer responsibilities, and you have fewer rights, if you are an independent contractor—and often they will misclassify you in order to avoid following the law! For this reason, it’s important that you know the difference so that you don’t get exploited!In general, you are an employee (NOT an independent contractor) if the following are true:</p><ol class="text">The employer decides what tasks and assignments you do and directs your work; The employer controls how, where, and when you do your work; The employer supervises your work, and you’re required to follow their instructions; The employer trains you in how to do your work;The employer provides you with any necessary equipment, tools, and other materials;The work you do is a regular and necessary part of the employer’s business—not just a side activity;The employer sets your hours and pays you a set wage or salary;The employer has the right to fire you—and you have the right to quit—at any time.<sup><a href="#footnote-1996" id="footnote-ref-1996">[1996]</a></sup></ol><p class="text">In addition, the law generally presumes that you are an employee—and NOT an independent contractor—unless specific factors show otherwise.<sup><a href="#footnote-1997" id="footnote-ref-1997">[1997]</a></sup> </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Whether you are an employee or an independent contractor depends on the specific details of your work situation and your relationship with the employer—NOT on what the employer calls you!</p><h4>WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AS AN EMPLOYEE (VS.

This section will explain each of these exceptions. </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">(1) UNDUE HARDSHIP</div><p class="text">An employer does NOT have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer. There is no single definition of “undue hardship”—it is a case-by-case question that depends on the type of accommodation you’re requesting and the employer’s particular situation—e.g., what type of business it is, how many employees, the employer’s financial situation, etc. In general, however, an undue hardship means that the accommodation you want would be too expensive or difficult for the employer make, or would have a significant impact on the employer’s business, or would be too disruptive to the business or to the work of other employees.However, an employer CANNOT claim undue hardship based on employees' (or customers') fears or prejudices about your disability (e.g., fears or prejudices about people with past addictions or mental health issues). Also, an employer CANNOT claim that other employees would be upset about giving you an accommodation. Finally, an employer CANNOT claim that making an accommodation—for example, hiring someone with a criminal conviction—would cause their insurance premiums to go up.<sup><a href="#footnote-1998" id="footnote-ref-1998">[1998]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">Important:</span> Even if an employer can show that the particular accommodation you asked for would cause undue hardship, the employer may still have to provide a different accommodation if there is some other type of accommodation that would also be effective and would NOT cause a hardship.<sup><a href="#footnote-1999" id="footnote-ref-1999">[1999]</a></sup> </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">(2) DIRECT THREAT</div><p class="text">The law does not require that an employer give you reasonable accommodations for your disability if you would pose a significant danger to the health or safety of yourself or others AND there is NO possible reasonable accommodation that would remove or reduce the risk of harm.<sup><a href="#footnote-2000" id="footnote-ref-2000">[2000]</a></sup> There are some protections for you if an employer is arguing that you would be a direct threat to other employees, customers or property:</p><ol class="text">First, an employer must first make an individualized assessment of you and whether you can safely perform the essential functions of the job.<sup><a href="#footnote-2001" id="footnote-ref-2001">[2001]</a></sup>Second, an employer can only reject you if you pose a significant risk of harm to others and there is a high likelihood that you will harm someone due to your condition.<sup><a href="#footnote-2002" id="footnote-ref-2002">[2002]</a></sup>Third, in deciding whether your conditions creates a significant risk of harm, the employer must consider your individual situation and history of substance/alcohol abuse—for example, whether you have a history of harmful behavior due to your addiction—and CANNOT simply go on assumptions or statistics about people who suffer from substance/alcohol addiction and their likelihood of relapse.<sup><a href="#footnote-2003" id="footnote-ref-2003">[2003]</a></sup>Fourth, the employer’s evaluation must rely on the most current medical knowledge and the best available objective evidence—NOT simply stereotypes, fears, or assumptions about people with mental illness, addiction, or other disabilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-2004" id="footnote-ref-2004">[2004]</a></sup></ol><div class="headingboldunderl11">(3) CANNOT SAFELY PERFORM ESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS. </div><p class="text">Finally, an employer is NOT required to provide reasonable accommodations if they can show that you are unable to safely perform essential job functions—in other words, you are not qualified for the job—even with a reasonable accommodation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2005" id="footnote-ref-2005">[2005]</a></sup> However, an employer can only make this argument based on the specific requirements of the job position you are seeking (not general requirements for other types of jobs), and if there are NO reasonable accommodations that could enable you to do the work.<sup><a href="#footnote-2006" id="footnote-ref-2006">[2006]</a></sup></p><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_U_Disabilities_ReasonableAccommod"></a>Appendix U</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppU"></a>Employment Rights for People with Disabilities: Requesting a Reasonable Accommodation for Your Disability</div><p class="text">If an employer’s hiring/employment policy causes your job application to be rejected (or causes other adverse action against you) based on a conviction that was caused by your disability, you have the right to request a “reasonable accommodation” so that you can be considered for the job just like other applicants.To request an accommodation, the law only requires you to tell the employer that you need an accommodation for a reason related to a medical condition. You do NOT have to put your request in writing, and you do NOT have to use any special legal language—you can explain your request in normal words. You can request an accommodation at any time during the job application process or after you begin working.<sup><a href="#footnote-2007" id="footnote-ref-2007">[2007]</a></sup></p><h4 class="sidebox"><span class="emphasisitalic">HELPFUL HINT:</span> </h4><p class="sidebox">You can also have someone else talk to the employer for you, to ask for the accommodation you need. In this case, you may want to ask your case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or another trusted person who is helping you with your job search, to speak with the employer on your behalf.</p><p class="text">HOWEVER, because it is generally believed that employers are less likely to be sympathetic and less willing to change policies regarding criminal convictions (even where the conviction was caused by your disability), it is recommended that you give the employer a WRITTEN LETTER requesting the reasonable accommodation. (Be sure to make a photocopy for yourself before sending the letter). This will make it more difficult for the employer to ignore your request, and you will have documentation in case the employer denies it.It’s recommended that your letter clearly include ALL of the following:</p><ol class="text">Explain that you have a disability, and what that disability is.Include any documentation of your disability and treatment.Clearly state the accommodation you are requesting (for example, that you are asking the employer to make an exception to the hiring policy that would exclude you due to a criminal conviction that was caused by your disability, or you are asking for time off to attend treatment).Explain the reason that you are requesting the accommodation:Here, you could say that an exception from criminal history policy is NECESSARY to give you an equal opportunity to participate in the job.Explain the connection (meaning the relationship or “nexus”) between the requested accommodation and your disability. Explain how your criminal conduct was the result of the mental illness and/or past substance abuse (for example, state that you were convicted of drug possession because you were addicted to drugs, but you have successfully completed rehab).It is helpful and more persuasive if you have a doctor or service provider submit a letter explaining why your disability requires a reasonable accommodation. </ol><p class="text">For a sample letter requesting reasonable accommodation for a disability, see Appendix U, PG. 714.</p><div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_U_Disabilities_SampleAccomReqLet"></a><a id="EM_App_V_Disabilities_SampleAccomReqLet"></a>Appendix V</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppV"></a>Employment Rights for People with Disabilities: Sample Letter Requesting Reasonable Accommodation </div><p class="text">Here is a sample letter to request a reasonable accommodation for your disability.

The money you owe can make it very hard to get back on your feet, which can leave you feeling frustrated and discouraged. Unfortunately, this Chapter includes a lot of BAD NEWS about court-ordered debt because most of the laws that control court-ordered debt are NOT in your favor. However, reentry advocates—and even some politicians— who realize that this kind of debt harms not only formerly incarcerated people who are trying to start over, but also the communities they are returning to, are working to change these laws. In the meantime, this Chapter will give you some important information to help you better understand your rights, responsibilities, and opportunities when it comes to managing money that you owe due to your past court involvement (referred to in the rest of the Chapter as “court-ordered debt”).</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153497"></a>What is court-ordered debt and why do I need to know about it? </h3><p class="text">Court-ordered debt is money that you may owe because of some involvement you had with the criminal justice system—whether you were convicted, acquitted, your charges were dismissed, or you were only ever arrested. You may owe this money to the <em>court</em> itself, to the <em>county</em> or other <em>government agency</em>, to a <em>victim</em> of your crime, or even to a <em>collection agency</em>. If you were convicted of a crime, you most likely owe court-related costs, or owed them at one point. But <em>even if you were never convicted</em> of anything, the court can still make you pay other fees, such as jail booking fees, public defender fees, and fees associated with minor offenses called infractions. It is important that you know about and understand any court-ordered debt you owe, because this debt can make it difficult for you to move forward with your life in many different ways. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153498"></a>I’ve never received anything telling me that I owe money; so I must not have any court-ordered debt, right? </h3><p class="text">Absolutely not! People move; paperwork gets lost in the mail; and addresses get written down incorrectly all the time. Just because you haven’t heard anything, doesn’t mean that you’re in the clear. Remember, if you have had any involvement with the criminal justice system, <em>especially if you have a conviction</em>, you were most likely ordered to pay money of some kind at some point. If you don’t take steps to find out about and take care of your debt, there could be serious consequences. Even if you are 100% positive that you have paid off your debt entirely, mistakes can be made. Your payments may not have been properly recorded, or your name could be attached to someone else’s debt! It is better to check and be safe than to assume and be sorry. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153499"></a>What are the different types of court ordered debt? </h3><p class="text">There are three main types of court-ordered debt: (1) restitution; (2) fines and penalties; and (3) administrative fees. (You may also have debt from unpaid traffic fines and tickets. These are discussed later in this Chapter, on PG. 732).

The chart above tries to explain the four basic types of court-ordered debt, but the names you see on your actual court paperwork and “sentencing order” may be different. For example, sometimes the same word (for example, “fee” or “assessment”) is used to mean <em>different things </em>by <em>different courts in different counties</em>. If you have any questions about your court-ordered debts and what they mean, ask your public defender or the lawyer who represented you in your case.Because each type of court-ordered debt has a different purpose, you will probably owe many different types of debt (restitution, fines, and fees) even if you have only one conviction. If you have more than one conviction, you will likely owe separate sets of court-ordered debt for each conviction. </p><h2><a id="_Toc448153500"></a>A Basic Overview of Court-Ordered DebT RESTITUTION</h2><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153501"></a>Restitution</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153502"></a>What is restitution?</h3><p class="text">Restitution is money that you are ordered to pay to <em>victims</em> and to the <em>state</em> if you are convicted of a crime. Restitution is intended to repay the victims for the harm they suffered, and to repay your debt to society. Judges are <em>required</em> to order restitution if you are convicted of a crime, regardless of whether you can afford to pay. Restitution is the most serious type of court-ordered debt and the hardest to get rid of.<sup><a href="#footnote-2014" id="footnote-ref-2014">[2014]</a></sup> </p><h4 class="textbox"><strong>TYPES OF RESTITUTION:</strong></h4><p class="textbox">To make things even more complicated, there are different types of restitution—each with a different purpose. The three main types of restitution are: <em>(1) VICTIM RESTITUTION</em> (also called <em>Direct Orders of Restitution</em>): Victim restitution goes to the <em>victim(s)</em> of your crime to <em>repay any harm </em>caused <em>or losses</em> suffered because of your actions. If your crime involved injury to a <em>person</em>, <em>property damage,</em> or <em>economic loss</em>, you will have to pay victim restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2015" id="footnote-ref-2015">[2015]</a></sup> Usually the court orders victim restitution at the time of <em>sentencing</em>, however, the court can order it <em>at any time</em> afterward, if needed.<sup><a href="#footnote-2016" id="footnote-ref-2016">[2016]</a></sup> This means that even if the judge did NOT order victim restitution when you were sentenced, he or she can still order it later—and you will still have to pay it! <em>(2) RESTITUTION FINES</em>: Restitution fines go to <em>the state</em> to <em>repay your debt to society</em>. <em>Everyone </em>who is convicted of a crime MUST pay a restitution fine, so if you have a conviction—regardless of whether it was a misdemeanor or a felony—you have to pay a restitution fine.<sup><a href="#footnote-2017" id="footnote-ref-2017">[2017]</a></sup>In some situations, even if you were never convicted, you may still have to pay a restitution fine. For example, if your case was dismissed because you successfully completed a diversion program (i.e. drug treatment or anger management) or you received a deferred entry of judgment (DEJ), you will still be ordered to pay a restitution fine.<sup><a href="#footnote-2018" id="footnote-ref-2018">[2018]</a></sup> Also, if some of your charges were dismissed as part of a plea bargain, you still may have to pay restitution on the dismissed charges!<sup><a href="#footnote-2019" id="footnote-ref-2019">[2019]</a></sup><em>(3) REVOCATION RESTITUTION FINES</em>: If you are sentenced to <em>any type of supervision</em> (parole, mandatory supervision, Post Release Community Supervision, or probation), the court will impose a revocation restitution fine. However, this fine is suspended unless you violate the conditions of your supervision and your supervision is revoked. This means you do not have to pay this fine unless your supervision is<em> revoked</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2020" id="footnote-ref-2020">[2020]</a></sup></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT VICTIM RESTITUTION: Victim restitution never goes away. It is not discharged in bankruptcy,<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2021" id="footnote-ref-2021">[2021]</a></sup></strong> and you will continue to owe any unpaid victim restitution even after you have completed your sentence and term of supervision. The court will ALMOST NEVER waive or excuse your restitution, or let you do community service instead of paying. Unless the court finds “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to let you out of your restitution obligation, the only way to get rid of victim restitution is to pay it off. Unfortunately, the fact that you can’t afford to pay it off is not an “extraordinary and compelling reason!”<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2022" id="footnote-ref-2022">[2022]</a></sup></strong></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153503"></a>Is it possible to owe more than one type of restitution? </h3><p class="text">Yes. In fact, it is likely that you owe more than one type of restitution. Almost everyone with a conviction will owe victim restitution. Most people will owe BOTH victim restitution AND restitution fines.<sup><a href="#footnote-2023" id="footnote-ref-2023">[2023]</a></sup> Anyone whose supervision was permanently revoked may owe all three types of restitution. Also, if you have convictions from more than one case, the court can order all three types of restitution in each case.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2024" id="footnote-ref-2024">[2024]</a></sup></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153504"></a>Who is considered a “victim” to recover victim restitution?</h3><p class="text">The law defines “victim” VERY broadly. Even if no one was physically hurt during the crime, the court can order you to pay for property damage or economic losses caused by the crime. You could be ordered to pay restitution to ANY of the following:</p><ol class="text">A specific person (or people) who suffered physical or emotional harm, had property taken or damaged, or had to pay out-of-pocket expenses as a result of the crime;The family of the person harmed;The Victim Compensation &amp; Government Claims Board (Restitution Fund);A business that was damaged or had money losses due the crime; and/orA government agency that was damaged or had money losses, suffered vandalism damage, or had to clean or repair graffiti caused by the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-2025" id="footnote-ref-2025">[2025]</a></sup> </ol><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153505"></a>Court fines and penalties</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153506"></a><a id="COD_CourtFinesPenalties_defined"></a>What are court fines and penalties? </h3><p class="text">Court fines and penalties are money you must pay as part of your <em>punishment</em> for your conviction, in addition to the rest of your sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2026" id="footnote-ref-2026">[2026]</a> </sup>The amount you have to pay will depend on the <em>specific offense(s)</em> you were convicted of, and the total amount you owe for <em>other fines</em>. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You may be charged multiple sets of fines and penalties for the same conviction, because the state and county can each fine you separately for the offense.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2027" id="footnote-ref-2027">[2027]</a></sup></strong></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153507"></a>What should I know about court fines and penalties?</h3><ol class="text">Some fines and penalties can be ordered as <em>conditions of your probation</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2028" id="footnote-ref-2028">[2028]</a></sup> (See PG. 729 for fines and penalties that are conditions of your probation.)Some fines and penalties are determined based on your <em>ability to pay</em>, which means the court must find that you can <em>afford to pay the fine</em> BEFORE imposing them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2029" id="footnote-ref-2029">[2029]</a></sup> Others are imposed regardless of your ability to pay.<sup><a href="#footnote-2030" id="footnote-ref-2030">[2030]</a></sup></ol><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153508"></a>Court administrative fees</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153509"></a><a id="COD_CourtAdminFees_defined"></a>What are court administrative fees? </h3><p class="text">Administrative fees are money you pay to the courts, county, and other agencies to cover the day-to-day costs of running the courts and criminal justice system. Administrative fees are used to pay for things like court security, probation supervision, public defender fees, jail time, and debt collection.<sup><a href="#footnote-2031" id="footnote-ref-2031">[2031]</a></sup> Some fees are imposed by the court; other fees are imposed by the county or by other agencies.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153510"></a>What should I know about court administrative fees? </h3><ol class="text">Administrative fees generally CANNOT be conditions of probation, because they are NOT intended as punishment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2032" id="footnote-ref-2032">[2032]</a></sup> One exception to this rule is the Criminal Justice Administration Fee (sometimes referred to as the jail booking fee), which CAN be a condition of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2033" id="footnote-ref-2033">[2033]</a></sup>Most administrative fees are imposed only if you are able to pay them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2034" id="footnote-ref-2034">[2034]</a></sup> Often, these fees can be waived.<sup><a href="#footnote-2035" id="footnote-ref-2035">[2035]</a></sup></ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153511"></a>What happens to my court-ordered debt while I’m incarcerated?</h3><p class="text">Your debts CAN increase while you’re inside—but WHETHER they do and by HOW MUCH will depend on different things, such as: how old the debt is, whether it has been sent to collections, the amount of victim restitution you owe, and whether you’ve been making restitution payments. Some reasons your debt may increase while you’re incarcerated are:</p><h4 class="sidebox">What is “DELINQUENT DEBT”?</h4><p class="sidebox">If you have missed one or more payments, your debt is “overdue” or “delinquent.” Usually, you will get a letter notifying you that your debt has become delinquent, and you will have a limited time to make a payment or reestablish an installment plan before extra punishments and fines are imposed.</p><h4 class="sidebox">What are “COLLECTION AGENCIES”?</h4><p class="sidebox">When courts (or anyone else) can’t get a person to pay their debt on time, they often will hire a “collection agency” to try to get back the money owed. Collection agencies track down the person who owes (the “debtor”), and tries to get them to pay. If they are successful in collecting the debt, the collection agency receives a percentage of the payment. </p><ol class="text">You can be charged interest and administrative fees on your restitution debts.<sup><a href="#footnote-2036" id="footnote-ref-2036">[2036]</a></sup> NOTE: If you are paying restitution through your facility while incarcerated, you may be charged administrative fees for any payments you make.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2037" id="footnote-ref-2037">[2037]</a></sup> If CDCR or a county agency is automatically taking restitution payments directly from your prison or jail account, you may not even realize you’re being charged extra. (See PG. 744 for more information about paying restitution while you’re incarcerated.)If your debt is <em>delinquent</em>, you may be charged a $300 penalty (called a “civil assessment”) for late payments or non-payment. NOTE: If you were unable to pay the debt <em>because</em> you were incarcerated, you may be able to ask the court to forgive (“vacate”) the penalty.<sup><a href="#footnote-2038" id="footnote-ref-2038">[2038]</a></sup> (See PG. 746 for information on vacating civil assessment charges.)If your debt has been sent to “collections” (see explanation in side box) you may be charged an extra administrative fee to cover the costs of transferring your debt to the collection agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2039" id="footnote-ref-2039">[2039]</a></sup>You may be charged for failures to appear in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2040" id="footnote-ref-2040">[2040]</a></sup>You may be charged a fee if your driver license was suspended due to unpaid court debts.<sup><a href="#footnote-2041" id="footnote-ref-2041">[2041]</a></sup></ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153512"></a>Will my debts be sent to “collections”? </h3><p class="text">Maybe. The more <em>delinquent</em> your debt is, the more likely that it will be, or already has been, sent to collections. Each court, county, and agency handles unpaid debts differently. The court may start by trying to collect the debt itself. Once the debt becomes overdue, courts often send unpaid debts to the county collection agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2042" id="footnote-ref-2042">[2042]</a></sup> If the debt remains unpaid, the court or county collection agency may then send your debt to a private collection agency or to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), which acts as a collections agency for the state and for CDCR.<sup><a href="#footnote-2043" id="footnote-ref-2043">[2043]</a></sup> For more information on tracking down your debt, see PG. 742. For more information on what to do if your court-ordered debt HAS BEEN sent to collections, see PG. 741.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153513"></a>How can my court-ordered debt affect me while I am on a term of supervision?</h3><p class="text">If you are under any type of supervision—parole, mandatory supervision, Post-Release Community Supervision, or probation—it is very important to know which debts are conditions of that supervision, and to pay them first, if possible. In general, making restitution payments will ALWAYS be a condition of your supervision.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2044" id="footnote-ref-2044">[2044]</a></sup> Other fines and fees can also be ordered as conditions of supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-2045" id="footnote-ref-2045">[2045]</a></sup> You can find out exactly which payments the court considers conditions of your probation by asking your parole or probation officer for a copy of your supervision order. You (or your attorney) can also go to the court and ask the clerk for a copy of the records (the “minutes”) from your sentencing. If you don’t pay the debts that are conditions of your supervision: (1) the court can <em>extend</em> the term of your supervision to the maximum time allowed,<sup><a href="#footnote-2046" id="footnote-ref-2046">[2046]</a></sup> or (2) the court may order you to do community service to satisfy your remaining fines and fees, or (3) the court may determine that you have violated your supervision and re-incarcerate you. If you are on probation and you complete your probation term, but you haven’t paid off all the restitution and fines that are conditions of your probation, the court may find that you <em>did NOT successfully complete probation</em>. This can make it harder to get your conviction dismissed later under California’s expungement statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-2047" id="footnote-ref-2047">[2047]</a></sup> However, due to a recent court decision, you cannot be denied mandatory expungement because you still owe victim restitution. See PG. 1062 for more information on mandatory and expungement and victim restitution. Here are other ways that owing unpaid restitution and other fines can affect you while you are on supervision:</p><ol class="text">It can be harder to transfer to another county, and you will NOT be allowed to transfer out of state.<sup><a href="#footnote-2048" id="footnote-ref-2048">[2048]</a></sup> If you want to get discharged early, it is very important to make reasonable restitution payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2049" id="footnote-ref-2049">[2049]</a></sup>Even if you successfully complete your supervision and are discharged, you will continue to owe any unpaid restitution (and all other debts that the court does not discharge).<sup><a href="#footnote-2050" id="footnote-ref-2050">[2050]</a></sup> </ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT!—If you are UNDER ANY KIND OF SUPERVISION: <em>It is very important to know which debts are conditions of that supervision—and to pay them first, if possible.</em> In general, making <em>restitution</em> payments will ALWAYS be a condition of your supervision.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2051" id="footnote-ref-2051">[2051]</a></sup></strong> <em>Other fines and fees</em> can also be ordered as conditions of supervision.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2052" id="footnote-ref-2052">[2052]</a></sup></strong> You can find out exactly which payments the court considers conditions of your probation by asking your parole or probation officer for a copy of your supervision order.

Different types of debts have different consequences if you don’t pay them off. The consequences are also affected by the amount of debt you owe, how old the debt is, and which agency is trying to collect from you (for example, whether your debt is still with the court, with county collections, with a private collection agency, or with the Franchise Tax Board). In the previous section we explained what can happen if you don’t pay debts that are conditions of your supervision. This section will explain some of the <em>other</em> consequences you may face if you don’t pay off your court-ordered debts (whether you are on supervision or not).</p><h4><a id="COD_DebtCollection_ifnopayment"></a>Debt Collection:</h4><p class="text">If you owe unpaid restitution, fines, or court fees, the people or agencies that you owe (i.e. the victim, the victim’s family, the Victim Compensation Board, the Franchise Tax Board, private collection agencies) can try to collect the unpaid debt in the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-2066" id="footnote-ref-2066">[2066]</a></sup></p><ol class="text"><a id="COD_WageGarnishment"></a><em>Wage garnishment—</em>If you are employed, a portion of your wages (up to 25%) can be automatically taken out (withheld) from your paycheck to pay your court-ordered debt. Money can continue to be taken from your paycheck until you have paid off the full amount you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2067" id="footnote-ref-2067">[2067]</a></sup> (For more information about what to do if your wages are being garnished by the Franchise Tax Board, see PG. 745.)<em>Property lien—</em>If you own property (like a car or a house) a <em>lien</em> can be put on your property. A lien gives the person (or agency) that you owe the right to <em>claim your property</em> to satisfy the debt you owe them. If you have a lien on your property, you may not be able to sell that property until you have paid off the amount you owe. If you DO sell the property, you will have to give over the money from the sale to the person you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2068" id="footnote-ref-2068">[2068]</a></sup><em>Lien on your bank account—</em>If you have a bank account, a lien can be put on the account.

Some other ways that you may be negatively impacted by unpaid court-ordered debt are:</p><ol class="text">Your <em>driver license</em> can be suspended due to unpaid court debts AND you can be charged extra fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2070" id="footnote-ref-2070">[2070]</a></sup> (Your driver license can also be suspended for other types of unpaid debt, such as child support or unpaid loans. See PG. 57 of the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER for more information about driver license suspensions.)It can be harder to get a <em>professional or occupational license</em>, which is required for many types of jobs. For example, you need an occupational license to work as a barber, beautician, nurse, or contractor. (For more information on professional/occupational licenses, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, PG. 654.)The Franchise Tax Board can seize any <em>state tax refunds,</em> <em>lottery winnings, or other income</em> to pay off your restitution and fine obligations.<sup><a href="#footnote-2071" id="footnote-ref-2071">[2071]</a></sup> If you are <em>ordered to appear</em> in court because you have not paid your court-ordered debt, and you do not go to court, you could be <em>arrested</em> and charged with a <em>misdemeanor</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2072" id="footnote-ref-2072">[2072]</a></sup> <em>Important</em>: If you have not made payments, you won’t be arrested simply for not paying. However, if a judge has ordered you to come to court and explain why you are not paying, you can be arrested for not going to court. If you receive an “order to appear,” you MUST go to court on the day and time listed in the order. Even if you don’t have any money to make the payments, it is very important that you attend this court hearing. Unpaid restitution and/or other fines can make it harder, to get your conviction dismissed under California’s “expungement” statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-2073" id="footnote-ref-2073">[2073]</a></sup> But, you cannot be denied a mandatory dismissal of your conviction just because you have unpaid victim restitution.

Your credit score is a number—usually between 300 and 850. <em>The higher the number, the better your score.</em> Your credit score is based on things like current debts you owe (including court-ordered debts), whether you've paid off previous debts in a timely manner, your income, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-2074" id="footnote-ref-2074">[2074]</a></sup> Creditors, landlords, and some employers may look at your credit score when deciding whether to give you a loan, rent an apartment to you, or hire you for a job. (<em>Note</em>: In California, only certain people can legally see your credit score. For more information about what employers and landlords can see about you, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER (PG. 595) and HOUSING CHAPTER (PG. 351).If you want to know what your credit score is, you will probably have to pay to get it from a commercial credit reporting agency. However, you are entitled to a FREE COPY of your credit report, which will let you see the information that is used to calculate your credit score. You can request your free credit report by mail by submitting an Annual Credit Report Request Form.<sup><a href="#footnote-2075" id="footnote-ref-2075">[2075]</a></sup> A sample form is included in Appendix A, PG. 756.

Some counties have special traffic courts that deal exclusively with traffic-related issues. In others, the “traffic court” may just be a separate counter or department within the main courthouse. Traffic courts deal only with traffic infractions.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153518"></a><a id="COD_TrafficTickets_whatare"></a>What are traffic fines and tickets?</h3><p class="text"><strong><em>Traffic fines</em></strong> are penalties you are ordered to pay for driving-related or vehicle-related violations. Traffic tickets are the actual paper citations you get when you commit violations. There are three types of traffic tickets: </p><ol class="text"><strong><em>PARKING TICKETS—</em></strong>Parking tickets are for violations while your vehicle is parked (for example, if you park your car where or when you’re not allowed to, or don’t pay the parking meter).<sup><a href="#footnote-2082" id="footnote-ref-2082">[2082]</a></sup><strong><em>INFRACTION TICKETS</em>—</strong>Infraction tickets are for minor driving violations (such as running a stop sign or failing to use a turn signal), or often for mechanical problems with your car equipment (such as a broken tail-light), or for administrative violations related to your registration, insurance, or Drive License (for example, if one of these has expired).<sup><a href="#footnote-2083" id="footnote-ref-2083">[2083]</a></sup><strong><em>MISDEMEANOR TICKETS</em>—</strong>Misdemeanor tickets are issued for more serious driving violations (like a DUI or driving on a suspended license—these are types of misdemeanor criminal convictions).</ol><p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">NOTE: ANOTHER NAME FOR TRAFFIC FINES IS “BAIL”—</span>Traffic fines are also called “<em>bail.</em>” The traffic court may use this term when talking about your traffic fines and payments. Traffic “bail” is not the same thing as bail in a criminal case, but is sometimes used in a similar way. As of June 8, 2015, if you are required to appear in court for an <em>infraction</em> ticket, you no longer need to “post bail” (pay some or all of your traffic fine) beforehand, except in a few situations.<sup><a href="#footnote-2084" id="footnote-ref-2084">[2084]</a></sup> If you are required to appear in court for a <em>misdemeanor</em> ticket, you may need to “post bail” (pay some or all of your traffic fine) BEFORE your court date. You will then get this money back if the court dismisses your ticket or finds you not guilty of the traffic violation. This Chapter will use the term “fines” instead of “bail” to describe the money you owe for a traffic ticket. </p><h4 class="sidebox">What are “Fix-it” Tickets (Correctable Violations)?</h4><p class="sidebox">A correctible violation (“fix-it”) ticket is a ticket for a problem with your car that you must fix (for example, a broken tail light, expired registration. After you fix the problem, and show the court proof, your ticket will be dismissed. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153519"></a>How do I know which type of ticket I have?</h3><p><em>If you park or leave your car somewhere and there is a ticket on the windshield when you get back</em>, this is probably a <em>parking ticket (although some agencies will issue “fix-it” tickets for parked cars with visible mechanical issues or expired registration tags)</em>. Parking tickets are the least serious type of ticket and do NOT involve the courts.</p><p><em>If you get pulled over and get a ticket while driving</em>, it is an <em>infraction</em> or a <em>misdemeanor</em> <em>ticket</em>. Usually you get these tickets from a law enforcement officer who pulls you over on the road for a violation you committed while driving.</p><ol class="text">An <em>infraction ticket</em> will instruct you to either <em>pay a fine</em>, or <em>appear in court</em> on a particular date and time if you want to challenge the ticket or can’t pay the fine. For a <em>misdemeanor ticket</em>, you MUST <em>appear in court</em> on the date and time shown or a warrant will be issued for your arrest. (That’s why the ticket is also called a “Notice to Appear”). </ol><p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">NOTE:</span> For some <em>misdemeanor violations</em> (for example, a DUI), the police may <em>arrest</em> you on the spot and take you into custody. You may need to <em>pay bail</em> and/or sign a <em>promise to appear in court</em> before the police let you go. Afterward, you MUST <em>appear in court</em> on the date and time assigned to you in the promise to appear.</p><p><em>Tickets related to your car equipment, registration, insurance, or Driver License</em> are usually <em>infraction tickets</em>. Sometimes you can get the ticket dismissed if you correct the problem that you were cited for (also called a “fix-it” ticket or “correctable violation”). </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: When you sign any ticket, you are making a promise to do something—pay the fine, appear in court, and/or correct the problem as required by the ticket. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153520"></a>What could happen if I get a new ticket? </h3><p class="text">It depends on the type of ticket you get.<span class="emphasisitalic">Parking tickets:</span><em> </em>If you get a parking ticket, you just have to pay a fine. The ticket will have information about how much the fine is, what agency you owe it to (usually to the local city government or parking authority), and how to pay (by mail, in person, by phone, or online). If you disagree with the ticket, you can contact the parking agency and ask how to challenge it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2085" id="footnote-ref-2085">[2085]</a></sup> I<em>f you don’t pay the parking ticket on time</em>, the fines will increase. <em>Eventually</em>, if you haven’t paid the fine, you will not be able to renew your car registration. Parking tickets will NOT affect your ability to get a state ID or driver license because parking tickets attach to a <em>vehicle</em>, NOT a person.<sup><a href="#footnote-2086" id="footnote-ref-2086">[2086]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Infraction tickets:</span><em> </em>If you get an infraction ticket, read the ticket carefully to see what to do. You may just need to <em>pay a fine</em> or you may have to fix whatever problem the ticket was issued for and then bring proof to the issuing agency. However, you may be required to <em>appear in court</em> on a particular date and time. You must act BEFORE the deadline on your ticket. <em>Remember, by signing the ticket, you have promised to pay the fine, correct the problem, or appear in court</em>.You may have to:</p><ol class="text"><em>Pay the fine</em>, which means you plead guilty to the violation and the court will close the case.

This means that instead of going to court to fight your case, you and the police officer give the judge statements and evidence in writing.<sup><a href="#footnote-2091" id="footnote-ref-2091">[2091]</a></sup><em>If you got a “fix-it” ticket</em>,<strong> </strong>you can have your case dismissed by fixing the problem, showing proof that you have made the correction, and paying a fee. To get a proof of correction, you must get an “authorized person” to sign the “Certificate of Correction” line on your ticket. An “authorized person” is:A DMV or court clerk—for driver license and car registration violations;A police officer—for equipment violations;A court clerk—for proof of car insurance.<sup><a href="#footnote-2092" id="footnote-ref-2092">[2092]</a></sup> </ol><p class="text"><strong>If you are on probation, parole, or community supervision:</strong> In most cases, an infraction ticket won’t be considered a violation of your probation or parole because infractions are not criminal offenses. However, in some cases, an infraction ticket <em>could</em> be a violation of your supervision, depending on your underlying conviction, the specific conditions of your supervision, and the nature of the infraction. For example, if you are on probation for a DUI offense and have conditions related to alcohol and driving, a ticket for having an open container in your vehicle might be considered a violation of your supervision. If you have any questions or concerns about your terms of supervision, you should talk to your probation or parole officer (or better yet, a lawyer).

However, these 3 general <em>types</em> of debt are the same in the federal system:</p><ol class="text"><em>Restitution</em>: <em>Repays any victims</em> (people, organizations, government agencies, etc.) that suffered harm, property damage, or monetary losses caused by your actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2120" id="footnote-ref-2120">[2120]</a></sup> This is like <em>victim restitution</em> in state court.<em>Fines</em>: Serve as additional <em>punishment</em> for your offense and are part of your criminal sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2121" id="footnote-ref-2121">[2121]</a></sup> The amount of the fine will depend on the crime for which you were convicted.<sup><a href="#footnote-2122" id="footnote-ref-2122">[2122]</a></sup> These are like <em>fines and penalties</em> in state court<em>.Special Assessments</em>: Fees assigned for each separate offense you were convicted of. The amount of the Assessment depends on the seriousness of the offense. <em>ALL of your federal Special Assessment debt will be forgiven 5 years after your conviction, after which you will no longer owe this debt</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2123" id="footnote-ref-2123">[2123]</a></sup> </ol><p class="importantbox">WARNING: Just like for state court debt, you may also owe additional interest or other penalties on your federal court-ordered debt (for example, if you don’t make required payments on time).</p><h2><a id="_Toc448153526"></a><a id="COD_TakingControl_Intro"></a>TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR COURT-ORDERED DEBT</h2><h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4><ul class="learn-bullets">How to take control of your court-ordered debt, including:How find out how much you owe; How to get your debt reduced or forgiven; andStrategies for managing and paying off your debt.</ul><p class="text">Taking control of your court-ordered debt is done by knowing the type of debt you owe, the amount of debt you owe, and creating plan as to how to repay this debt while understanding whether this debt has impact on your terms of probation and/or employment.

Below three different debt types are discussed as well as debts you may owe if you received traffic tickets as part of your case or if you had tickets prior to being incarcerated. </p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153528"></a>Restitution</h1><p class="text"><em>If you are incarcerated</em>, you should be able to get a copy of your restitution balance sheet from your facility (either a CDCR facility or county jail). Ask your Correctional Counselor if you have any questions about your restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2124" id="footnote-ref-2124">[2124]</a></sup> <em>If you have just been released</em>, your facility (or the agency it has chosen) will either continue to collect your debt itself or refer your debt out to a private collection agency or the Franchise Tax Board.<sup><a href="#footnote-2125" id="footnote-ref-2125">[2125]</a></sup> You should get a demand notice from whichever agency will continue collecting your restitution debt within 90 days of your release, although there is no set time for this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2126" id="footnote-ref-2126">[2126]</a></sup> </p><h4 class="sidebox">REQUESTING copies of your ORIGINAL SENTENCING ORDERS</h4><p class="sidebox">If you want to see what amounts you were originally ordered to pay, you can request a copy of your sentencing order from the court that sentenced you. HOWEVER, these amounts are the <em>original</em> amounts ordered by the court, and will NOT reflect any payments that you’ve made OR include any interest or fees that have been added since. The order also will NOT show the debts you owe from ANY other cases.</p><p class="text"><em>If you are on parole, probation, or community supervision</em>, talk to your parole agent or probation officer.<sup><a href="#footnote-2127" id="footnote-ref-2127">[2127]</a></sup> They can give you a copy of your balance sheet, which has information about how much you currently owe. At any time, you can also find out how much you owe by contacting an Adult Restitution Agent at the CDCR Office of Victim &amp; Survivor Rights &amp; Services Restitution Unit at (877) 256-6877 (toll free). They will be able to tell you your restitution balance and can give you information about what to do while you wait for the collection agency to contact you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2128" id="footnote-ref-2128">[2128]</a></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153529"></a>I haven’t ever received notice that I owe any money for restitution, so I probably don’t, right? </h3><p class="text">Not necessarily. While you <em>should</em> receive notice of your debt, it is possible that you won’t. As we said in the beginning of this Chapter, any number of things may have prevented the notice of your debt from getting to you. Even if you have received a demand notice, it is possible that the notice you received only covered <em>some</em>, but NOT <em>all</em> of your debts. Remember, your various debts may have been sent to different agencies. For this reason, it is possible that you owe money even if you did NOT receive a notice and it is possible that you owe more money than the notice stated. It is always better to check in order to be safe!</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153530"></a>Court fines and penalties and court administrative fees</h1><p class="text">As discussed on PG. 725, court fines and penalties are debts you may get as punishment or consequences for the crime you were charged with. Court administrative fees are paid for the daily operation of the court. While these two debts are different, here these debts are discussed together because the court usually adds these fees together and requires you to pay them together and to one office. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153531"></a><a id="COD_CourtAdminFee_PtII_collections_howto"></a>How do I find out if I have any court fines and fees?</h3><h4 class="step"><a id="COD_CtFinesPenalAdmin_howmuchowe"></a>Contact the court where you were convicted</h4><p class="text">To find out how much you owe in court fines and fees, you should start by contacting the court in the county where you were convicted. You should try to provide your case number, however you may be able to locate your case using your name, birth date, and/or other personal information. If you have any court papers from your case, they will list your case number and the county you were convicted in. If you don’t have any of your court papers, you may need to get a copy of your RAP sheet to figure out what court(s) you have convictions from. </p><h4 class="step"><a id="COD_CtFinesPenalAdmin_finddebt"></a>Find out where your debt is now</h4><p class="text">When you contact the court, the clerk should be able to tell you what you were ordered to pay, whether your case has been sent to collections, and if so, which collection agency now has your debt. Remember, if you have convictions from multiple cases, even if they are all in the same county, you will need to ask about every case. If you have convictions from different counties, you will need to contact the court in each county.Make sure to ask the court for the contact information for each and every agency that will be collecting your debt. If some or all of your debt is still with the court, ask the clerk how to contact the court’s “collection” or “revenue” unit (the department that keeps track of court-ordered debts and payments). (For a list of California county court collection unit contact information, see Appendix G, PG. 774.) </p><h4 class="step"><a id="COD_CtFinesPenalAdmin_contactcollections"></a>Contact the collection agency in charge of your debt</h4><p class="text">Once you know which collection agency is collecting your debt, you can contact them directly to ask how much you owe and how to pay. Remember that your debts may be collected by several different collection agencies, so you may need to contact all the different agencies to find out how much you owe in total. You may get shuffled around to many different people, but this is important, so be patient!</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153532"></a>Traffic fines &amp; fees</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153533"></a>How do I find out how much I owe in traffic fines?</h3><h4><a id="COD_TrafficFines_FindOutFees_new"></a>For NEW tickets and fines:</h4><ol class="text"><a id="COD_TrafficFines_owe_new_parkingtickets"></a>A <span class="emphasisitalic">parking ticket</span> shows the amount you must pay on the ticket itself.

These extra fees and penalties are added <em>automatically</em>—regardless of whether it’s a new or old ticket, and even if you pay everything on time! Your fines may also increase if you have prior traffic violations or points on your driving record. Depending on what your original ticket was for, the additional fees and penalties can sometimes add up to several hundred dollars for an infraction ticket (and much more for a misdemeanor ticket).<sup><a href="#footnote-2133" id="footnote-ref-2133">[2133]</a></sup></p><h2><a id="_Toc448153534"></a>paying off or “satisfying” my court-ordered debt </h2><p class="text">How you pay your fines, fees, and restitution will vary, because each court and agency handles unpaid debts slightly differently.

See PG. 742 above (Steps 2-3 on how to find out how much you owe in court fines and administrative fees) for instructions on how to identify and contact the agency(ies) in charge of collecting your debt.Remember that your debts may be collected by several different collection agencies, so you may need to contact each of these different agencies about making payments. </p><h4 class="step">Discuss your payment options.</h4><p class="text">When you contact the collection agency or court that’s in charge of your debt, a representative can help you design a payment plan that works best for your situation. The goal is to create a plan that will prevent you from facing extra fees or other penalties (like a hold on your DMV record) that can result from late or insufficient payments. It is important to be open and honest about your current financial situation, including whether or not you have a job, pay child support, or owe any other debts or payments. Most of the time, the collection representative will take these things into account and work with you to create a plan that you can realistically stick to.Depending on your individual situation and the amount of money you owe, the collection agency may ask you to pay everything off right away. In other situations, they may allow you to set up a payment plan so that you make smaller payments over time. Remember that the agency or court might charge a fee to cover the costs of managing your payment plan, and might charge additional fees for each payment you make.<sup><a href="#footnote-2144" id="footnote-ref-2144">[2144]</a></sup> Collection agencies can also charge BIG penalty fees for any late payments (or even demand that you pay off the entire remaining amount due). <em>Make sure you ask about fees and penalties and/or read the fine print before you agree to a payment plan!</em><strong> </strong></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153542"></a>What might happen if I can’t pay my debt?</h3><p class="text">If you don’t keep up with your payments, your debt becomes delinquent (overdue).

If you successfully complete traffic school, your ticket will still go on your driving record, but it will be made <em>confidential</em> (hidden).<sup><a href="#footnote-2157" id="footnote-ref-2157">[2157]</a></sup> Also, you will still have to pay all of your traffic fines, AND you will also have to pay additional enrollment fees to the court and to the traffic school.<sup><a href="#footnote-2158" id="footnote-ref-2158">[2158]</a></sup> However, you will NOT get any points added to your driving record,<sup><a href="#footnote-2159" id="footnote-ref-2159">[2159]</a></sup> which means your insurance rates won’t go up and your license will not be in danger of suspension or revocation. So, even though traffic school can cost you MORE money in the SHORT term, it can SAVE you a lot of money and trouble in the LONG run.

(You can also do this at the time when the judge first orders you to pay the fines.) Either the judge or another county official will do an evaluation of your financial situation. Based on this evaluation, the judge will decide how much of your fines—if any—you will have to pay, and will set up a payment plan for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2187" id="footnote-ref-2187">[2187]</a></sup> Some counties have <em>amnesty programs</em> that can reduce the amount of debt you owe for overdue <em>infraction</em> and <em>misdemeanor tickets</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2188" id="footnote-ref-2188">[2188]</a></sup> Contact the local traffic court to find out whether the county has an amnesty program and whether you are eligible.</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153555"></a>What options do I have to reduce or forgive my court-ordered debt?</h3><p class="text">It depends on the type of court-ordered debt.</p><h4>RESTITUTION</h4><p class="text">As we have stated, restitution is mandatory and stays with you for life. However, a judge may order you to do community service instead of paying restitution if he or she finds “compelling and extraordinary reasons” for doing so. Again, your inability to pay is not a compelling or extraordinary reason.<sup><a href="#footnote-2189" id="footnote-ref-2189">[2189]</a></sup></p><h4>COURT FINES &amp; PENALTIES AND COURT ADMINISTRATIVE FEES:</h4><p class="text">It is often possible to get your fines and fees <em>reduced</em> or <em>forgiven</em> (“<em>vacated</em>”) by the court. However, it depends heavily on what <em>county</em> your debt is from, and which <em>judge</em> is considering your case. In general, judges are more likely to reduce or waive fines and fees if you can show that:</p><ol class="text"><em>You’re making an effort to pay your debts</em> (for example, you’re paying restitution, even though you can’t afford to pay the other fines and fees);<em>You’re taking steps toward rehabilitation</em> (for example, you’re in drug treatment or anger management counseling; you’re enrolled in school; you’ve reunited with your family); and<em>You’re following all other conditions of your supervision</em>.</ol><p class="text">Here are some ways that you may be able to reduce, forgive, or otherwise satisfy your fines and fees:</p><ol class="text">Some courts may allow you to do<em> community service</em> instead of paying your fines and fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2190" id="footnote-ref-2190">[2190]</a></sup> However, there is a lot of variation from county to county, and many counties may not offer community service at all. If the judge did not give you the option of community service at sentencing, you should contact the court or local public defender to ask if the county runs a community service program.The court may allow you to <em>voluntarily</em> choose to do <em>jail time</em> instead of paying your court-ordered fines. You can get your debt reduced by $30/day spent in custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-2191" id="footnote-ref-2191">[2191]</a></sup>You can go to the court directly and ask the judge to forgive (“vacate” or “dismiss”) or reduce your debts.If you get your conviction dismissed, the court can forgive any remaining fines and fees you owe, including restitution <em>fines</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2192" id="footnote-ref-2192">[2192]</a></sup> (but the court CANNOT forgive your victim restitution).<sup><a href="#footnote-2193" id="footnote-ref-2193">[2193]</a></sup></ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PAYING YOUR COURT-ORDERED DEBT:<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2194" id="footnote-ref-2194">[2194]</a></sup></strong></p><ul class="importantbox"><em>If you owe payments on more than one case</em>, make sure you specify <em>which case</em> AND <em>which fine or fee within that case</em> your payment is for—otherwise the payments may automatically go to your oldest case first.<strong> <sup><a href="#footnote-2195" id="footnote-ref-2195">[2195]</a></sup></strong> Remember, you want to pay off the debts that are <em>conditions of probation</em>, BEFORE paying off any other debts. <em>Try to make small, consistent payments to the court</em>. This shows that you are aware of your debts and are doing your best to pay them off. It may also keep the court from sending your case to collections.<em>If you sign up for a payment plan</em>, make sure to ask about the <em>interest rate</em>, any <em>additional fees</em>, and penalties for missed payments. Collection agencies often add extra fees and interest to your account, which could increase the total amount you have to pay.Keep a list of all payments you make, including the date and time, and who you gave the payment to (the court, county collection agency, FTB, or private collection agency). When you make a payment, always ask for a receipt for the current payment and a print-out of the amount you still owe.</ul><h4>TRAFFIC FINES &amp; FEES</h4><p class="text">Expenses from traffic fines and fees may seem unimportant if you do not have a car and/or you do not drive frequently. However, remember that these fees (like the other fees discussed in this Chapter) may have a significant impact on your parole or probation conditions and/or finding employment. Because of their impact, it can help to find out if you have any tickets and if you owe any fees, so you can make informed future decisions about how to resolve your debt. </p><h2><a id="COD_Conclusion_TOC"></a><a id="_Toc448153556"></a>CONCLUSION	</h2><p class="text">Many people struggle with different types of debt, but it can be particularly difficult if you are trying to rebuild your life after incarceration. If you have court-ordered debt, the bottom line is, you will likely have to figure out a way to pay it off at some point. Hopefully this Chapter gave you some useful information to help you not only minimize the debt itself, but also its impact on your life. </p><p class="appendixtocheading"><a id="COD_App_TOC"></a><a id="_Toc448153557"></a>Court-Ordered Debt Appendix</p><div class="appendixlist">Annual Credit Report Request Form – PG. 756Earnings Withholding Order (Judicial Council Form WG-002) – PG. 758Employee Instructions (Wage Garnishment) (Judicial Council Form WG-003) – PG. 761 Claim of Exemption (Judicial Council Form EJ-160) – PG. 764Exemptions from the Enforcement of Judgments (Judicial Council Form EJ-155) – PG. 766Fair Debt Collection Practices &amp; A Sample Letter to Debt Collection Agency – PG. 769California County Court Collection Unit Contact Information – PG. 774Sample Petition to Vacate Civil Assessment – PG. 779Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: To Get and Keep a Good Credit Score – PG. 781</div><div class="appendix"><a id="COD_App_A_CreditReportRequest"></a>Appendix A</div><div class="appendixtitle">Annual Credit Report Request Form</div><p class="text">See the form on the next page.</p><p><img src="110.x-emf" /></p><div class="appendix"><a id="COD_App_B_EarningsWithholdingOrder"></a>Appendix B</div><div class="appendixtitle">Earnings Withholding Order<br />(Judicial Council Form WG-002)</div><p class="text">See next page.</p><p><img src="111.x-emf" /></p><p><img src="112.x-emf" /></p><div class="appendix"><a id="COD_App_C_JudicialCouncilFormWG003"></a>Appendix C</div><div class="appendixtitle">Employee Instructions<br />(Wage Garnishment)<br />(Judicial Council Form WG-003)</div><p class="text">See next page.<strong><img src="113.x-emf" /></strong><img src="114.x-emf" /></p><div class="appendix"><a id="COD_App_D_ClaimofExemption_EJ160"></a>Appendix D</div><div class="appendixtitle">Claim of Exemption<br />(Judicial Council Form EJ-160)</div><p class="text">See next page.</p><p><strong><img src="115.x-emf" /></strong></p><div class="appendix"><a id="COD_App_E_JudicialCouncilFormEJ155"></a>Appendix E</div><div class="appendixtitle">Exemptions from the Enforcement of Judgments<br />(Judicial Council Form EJ-155)</div><p class="text">See next page.</p><div class="appendixtitle"><strong><img src="116.x-emf" /></strong></div><p><strong><img src="117.x-emf" /></strong></p><div class="appendix"><a id="COD_App_F_FairDebtCollectionPractices"></a>Appendix F</div><div class="appendixtitle">Fair Debt Collection Practices &amp;<br />A Sample Letter to Debt Collection Agency</div><p class="text">The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is a federal law that prohibits debt collectors from using abusive, unfair, dishonest, or misleading practices to collect money from you. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the federal government’s agency that enforces your rights under the FDCPA.<sup><a href="#footnote-2196" id="footnote-ref-2196">[2196]</a></sup>Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is someone who regularly collects debts owed to others. This includes collection agencies, lawyers who collect debts on a regular basis, and companies that buy overdue debts and then try to collect them.Here are some questions and answers about your rights under the Act.</p><h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR CONTACT ME ANY TIME OR ANY PLACE?</h4><p class="text">No. A debt collector may not contact you at inconvenient times or places, such as before 8 AM or after 9 PM, unless you agree to it. And collectors may not contact you at work if they’re told (orally or in writing) that you’re not allowed to get calls there.</p><h4>HOW CAN I STOP A DEBT COLLECTOR FROM CONTACTING ME?</h4><p class="text">If a collector contacts you about a debt, you may want to talk to them at least once to see if you can resolve the matter – even if you don’t think you owe the debt, can’t repay it immediately, or think that the collector is contacting you by mistake. If you decide after contacting the debt collector that you don’t want the collector to contact you again, tell the collector – in writing – to stop contacting you. Here’s how to do that:Write a letter to the debt collector and make a copy of the letter (see PG. 773 below for a sample letter). Send the original by certified mail, and pay for a “return receipt” so you’ll be able to prove that the collector received the letter. Once the collector receives your letter, they may not contact you again, with two exceptions: A collector can contact you to (1) tell you there will be no further contact, or (2) let you know that they or the creditor intend to take a specific action, like filing a lawsuit. Sending such a letter to a debt collector to whom you owe money will NOT get rid of the debt, but it should stop the contact. The creditor or the debt collector still can sue you in court to collect the debt.</p><h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR CONTACT ANYONE ELSE ABOUT MY DEBT?</h4><p class="text">If an attorney is representing you about the debt, the debt collector must contact the attorney, rather than you. If you don’t have an attorney, a collector may contact other people – but only to find out your address, your home phone number, and where you work. Collectors usually are prohibited from contacting third parties more than once. Other than to obtain this location information about you, a debt collector generally is not permitted to discuss your debt with anyone other than you, your spouse, or your attorney.</p><h4>WHAT DOES THE DEBT COLLECTOR HAVE TO TELL ME ABOUT THE DEBT?</h4><p class="text">Every collector must send you a written “validation notice” telling you how much money you owe within five days after they first contact you. This notice also must include the name of the creditor to whom you owe the money, and how to proceed if you don’t think you owe the money.</p><h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR KEEP CONTACTING ME IF I DON’T THINK I OWE ANY MONEY?</h4><p class="text">If you send the debt collector a letter stating that you don’t owe any or all of the money, or asking for verification (proof) of the debt, that collector must stop contacting you. You have to send that letter within 30 days after you receive the validation notice. But a collector can begin contacting you again if it sends you written proof of the debt, like a copy of a bill for the amount you owe.</p><h4>WHAT PRACTICES ARE OFF LIMITS FOR DEBT COLLECTORS?</h4><p class="text"><strong>Harassment:</strong> Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse you or any third parties they contact. For example, they may not:</p><ol class="text">use threats of violence or harm;publish a list of names of people who refuse to pay their debts (but they can give this information to the credit reporting companies);use obscene or profane language; orrepeatedly use the phone to annoy someone.</ol><p class="text"><strong>False statements:</strong> Debt collectors may not lie when they are trying to collect a debt. For example, they may not:</p><ol class="text">falsely claim that they are attorneys or government representatives;falsely claim that you have committed a crime;falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit reporting company;misrepresent the amount you owe;indicate that papers they send you are legal forms if they aren’t; orindicate that papers they send to you aren’t legal forms if they are.</ol><p class="text"><strong>&gt; Debt collectors also are prohibited from saying that</strong>:</p><ol class="text">you will be arrested if you don’t pay your debt;they’ll seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages unless they are permitted by law to take the action and intend to do so; orlegal action will be taken against you, if doing so would be illegal or if they don’t intend to take the action.</ol><p class="text"><strong>&gt; Debt collectors may not</strong>:</p><ol class="text">give false credit information about you to anyone, including a credit reporting company;send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency if it isn’t; oruse a false company name.</ol><p class="text"><strong>Unfair practices</strong>: Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, they may not:</p><ol class="text">try to collect any interest, fee, or other charge on top of the amount you owe unless the contract that created your debt – or your state law – allows the charge;deposit a post-dated check early;take or threaten to take your property unless it can be done legally; orcontact you by postcard.</ol><h4>CAN I CONTROL WHICH DEBTS MY PAYMENTS APPLY TO?</h4><p class="text">Yes. If a debt collector is trying to collect more than one debt from you, the collector must apply any payment you make to the debt you select. Equally important, a debt collector may not apply a payment to a debt you don’t think you owe.</p><h4>CAN A DEBT COLLECTOR GARNISH MY BANK ACCOUNT OR MY WAGES?</h4><p class="text">If you don’t pay a debt, a creditor or its debt collector generally can sue you to collect. If they win, the court will enter a judgment against you. The judgment states the amount of money you owe, and allows the creditor or collector to get a garnishment order against you, directing a third party, like your bank, to turn over funds from your account to pay the debt.Wage garnishment happens when your employer withholds part of your compensation to pay your debts. Your wages usually can be garnished only as the result of a court order. Don’t ignore a lawsuit summons. If you do, you lose the opportunity to fight a wage garnishment.</p><h4>CAN MY FEDERAL BENEFITS BE GARNISHED?</h4><p class="text">Many federal benefits are exempt from garnishment (meaning they cannot be taken to pay certain debts), including:</p><ol class="text">Social Security BenefitsSupplemental Security Income (SSI) BenefitsVeterans’ BenefitsCivil Service and Federal Retirement and Disability BenefitsMilitary Annuities and Survivors’ BenefitsFederal Emergency Management Agency Federal Disaster Assistance</ol><p class="text">BUT federal benefits may be garnished under certain circumstances, including to pay delinquent taxes, alimony, child support, or student loans.</p><h4>WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS IF I THINK A DEBT COLLECTOR HAS VIOLATED THE LAW?</h4><p class="text">You have the right to sue a collector in a state or federal court within one year from the date the law was violated. If you win, the judge can require the collector to pay you for any damages you can prove you suffered because of the illegal collection practices, like lost wages and medical bills. The judge can require the debt collector to pay you up to $1,000, even if you can’t prove that you suffered actual damages. You also can be reimbursed for your attorney’s fees and court costs. A group of people also may sue a debt collector as part of a class action lawsuit and recover money for damages up to $500,000, or one percent of the collector’s net worth, whichever amount is lower. Even if a debt collector violates the FDCPA in trying to collect a debt, the debt does not go away if you owe it.</p><h4>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF A DEBT COLLECTOR SUES ME?</h4><p class="text">If a debt collector files a lawsuit against you to collect a debt, respond to the lawsuit, either personally or through your lawyer, by the date specified in the court papers to preserve your rights.</p><h4>WHERE DO I REPORT A DEBT COLLECTOR FOR AN ALLEGED VIOLATION?</h4><p class="text">Report any problems you have with a debt collector to the California Attorney General’s office, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. California has its own debt collection laws that may give you more rights and protections than the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation. </p><p class="chaptertoc">FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN: TABLE OF CONTENTS</p><a id="_Ref288852325"></a><p class="toc1">I.<strong>	</strong>Introduction	792</p><p class="toc2">Key Terms in the Family &amp; Children Chapter	792The Impact of a Criminal Record on a Legal Case About Your Child or Grandchild	796</p><p class="toc4">What is a criminal record?	796How will my criminal record impact my ability to reconnect with my child or grandchild?	796Are there any convictions that will automatically ban me from reconnecting with my child or grandchild?	797</p><p class="toc1">II.<strong>	</strong>The Rights of Parents &amp; Grandparents	798</p><p class="toc2">Any Automatic Rights?	798</p><p class="toc4">Do I automatically have a right to care for my child or grandchild?	798</p><p class="toc1">III.<strong>	</strong>Basic Steps to Reconnect with Your Child or Grandchild	800</p><p class="toc4">I am in reentry, and I want to reconnect with my child or grandchild.

What are custody and visitation?</em> Here, we explain the definitions of some of the key terms that will appear again and again in this Chapter, so you can refer back.<span class="emphasisheavy">Adoption: </span>Adoption means giving complete parental rights and responsibilities to someone who is not the child’s biological (“by blood”) parent. Once the adoption is final, the adoptive parents are considered to be the child’s new legal parents, and the child’s birth parents no longer have any rights to the child. Adoption is permanent, meaning it generally can’t be changed afterward. An adoptive parent can be a stepparent or domestic partner of one of the child’s birth parents, a relative who has been caring for the child, or someone not related to the child by blood.<a id="FamilyChildren_Arrears"></a><span class="emphasisheavy">Arrears:</span> Arrears are unpaid, overdue child support payments (child support debt). In other words, arrears are money you owe from past child support payments that you did not make. Arrears are different from <em>current</em> child support payments that you have to make now, which cover the cost of caring for your child today. Often, there are different rules for arrears (child support debt) and current child support payments (child support you owe now), so it’s important to know the difference. In addition, the state will charge you interest (10%) on your arrears, so the debt amount you owe will continue to increase—even if you’re actively paying your <em>current</em> child support payments.<span class="emphasisheavy">“Best Interest of the Child”:</span> This is the legal standard in any legal case involving a child’s care (like child custody and visitation cases) that the judge will use. The judge will ask what is in the “best interest of the child,” looking at factors like: the parent or caregiver’s criminal records and Child Protective Services (CPD) record, the child’s health and safety, and whether the child will be raised in a stable and loving environment.</p><a id="FC_Terms_CasePlan"></a><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Case Plan:</span> A case plan is created by Child Protective Services (CPS) when it gets involved in a case regarding your child. The case plan sets out the steps you must take to get your child back. For example, a case plan could require you to attend parenting or counseling classes, participate in substance abuse treatment, and/or visit with your child. If CPS has removed your child from your home, your CPS social worker or the juvenile dependency court judge should give you a copy of your case plan, and as part of the case plan, the county must offer you certain programs and services that you need to complete your case plan for a limited amount of time upon reentry (see the term for “Family Reunification Services” for more information below). </p><h4 class="sidebox">WHO MIGHT BE A CAREIVER?</h4><p class="sidebox">The person caring for your child may be the child’s <em>other parent</em>, or may be a relative, family friend, foster parent, or someone else who has a relationship with your child. These are just some <em>examples</em> of people who might be caregivers – so your child’s situation may be different!</p><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Caregiver:</span> A caregiver is a person responsible for a child’s care and supervision from day to day. The caregiver may or may not be the child’s biological parent OR the child’s legal guardian. In some cases, a caregiver who is a close blood relative of the child will have more legal rights in a given situation than a non-relative (meaning unrelated) caregiver.<span class="emphasisheavy">Child Support Payment:</span> A judge may order the parent who does <em>not</em> have custody (see definition below) of the child to pay child support to the parent who does have custody of the child. This “child support payment” is to help cover the cost of caring for the child.<span class="emphasisheavy">Child Protective Services (CPS):</span> CPS is the part of the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) that responds to reports of child abuse or neglect. Every county in California has a CPS office.<a id="FamilyChildren_CourtOrder_definition"></a><span class="emphasisheavy">Court Order:</span> A “court order” is a decision by a judge in court, usually in writing. A court order requires someone to do OR not do something. A court order might say whether you currently have custody and/or visitation with your child; who else has custody and/or visitation with your child; and which court is involved in your family’s case. Court orders also require you to do things like attend a parenting class or prevent you from contacting someone. It is important to know about any court orders in your child’s case, because a court order may restrict how and when you can contact your child OR your child’s caregiver—and will help you understand what steps to take next.<span class="emphasisheavy">Custodial Parent:</span> The custodial parent is the parent who has <em>physical custody</em> of his or her child, meaning the child <em>lives with</em> this parent.<em> For comparison, see also definition for “non-custodial parent” below.</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Custody:</span> Custody is the legal rights and responsibilities to live with and care for your child. While you were in prison/jail, you were unable to have custody of your child. Once you’re released, if you want to communicate with, visit, or get custody of your child, you will need to find out who has custody of your child now.</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Physical Custody:</span> The legal right to have your child live with you.<span class="emphasisheavy">Legal Custody:</span> The legal right to make important decisions about your child’s health, education, and well-being.</ol><p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Declaration of Paternity:</span> A “Declaration of Paternity” is a legal document that says who is the “natural father” (the biological father) of a child. It must be signed by <em>both</em> of the child’s biological parents (father and mother).<span class="emphasisheavy">Dependency Court: </span>The court family cases are started in if a child’s parent(s) are suspected of abuse or neglect and Child Protective Services (CPS) has become involved in the child’s case.<span class="emphasisheavy">Family Law Facilitator (sometimes called the Self-Help Facilitator):</span> Every family court should have a “Family Law Facilitator,” which is someone who can help you with court forms, answer questions, provide general information about family law issues, and walk you through some of the steps of your case if you do not have a lawyer. However, the Family Law Facilitator <em>cannot</em> give any legal advice or answer questions about a specific case. To find your local Family Law Facilitator, see Appendix A, PG. 881, or go to <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-facilitators.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-facilitators.htm</a>.<span class="emphasisheavy">Family Reunification Services:</span> These are services that Child Protective Services (CPS) must provide you with, with certain exceptions, if it is involved in a legal case regarding you and your child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2199" id="footnote-ref-2199">[2199]</a></sup> Family reunification services are meant to help you complete your “case plan” (see definition above) and any other dependency court requirements to encourage reunification with your child.<span class="emphasisheavy">Foster Care:</span> Sometimes when a child is removed from his or her parents’ home, the judge will send the child to live in a “foster care” placement. “Foster care” describes the placement of a child living with one or two “foster parents”—people who the State has licensed, trained and approved to care for children in their home. However, foster parents have fewer rights than legal guardians or biological parents, so the judge and Child Protective Services (CPS) will continue to be legally responsible for making decisions about the child.<span class="emphasisheavy">Guardian (or “Legal Guardian”):</span> A guardian is an adult (not the child’s parent), such as a relative or family friend, who has legal and physical custody (see definitions under “custody” above) of the child. A guardianship does <em>not</em> terminate the parental rights of the child’s legal or biological parents; it only puts their parental rights on hold while the guardian has physical and legal custody.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2200" id="footnote-ref-2200">[2200]</a></sup></sup> Learn more about guardians on PG. 827.<a id="FamilyChildren_LienDefinition"></a><span class="emphasisheavy">Lien:</span> A lien is the right to take (and sell) property belonging to another person until that person pays off a debt s/he owes. For more information about liens, read the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717.<span class="emphasisheavy">Local Child Support Agency (LCSA): </span>LCSAs are county-run offices that collect and enforce child support payments by making sure that custodial parents and guardians receive the payments from non-custodial parents.<span class="emphasisheavy">Non-Custodial Parent:</span> The non-custodial parent is the parent who does <em>not</em> have physical custody of his or her child. <em>For comparison, see also definition for “custodial parent” above.</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Notice:</span> In any case involving you and your rights as a parent, you are legally required to receive “notice” of the case, which means you must be informed of the case. This “notice” could be a letter mailed to you, an announcement made by the judge in court, paperwork handed to you in person in court, at your home, or while you are incarcerated. Depending on your role in the case, you may have the right to get the “notice” papers handed to you IN PERSON—even while incarcerated. Often, a local law enforcement officer or Sheriff takes on the role of giving people “notice” papers inside prison or jail. <span class="emphasisheavy">Parent</span>: We use the term “parent” to describe the child’s legal or biological mother or father, with the understanding that the child’s parent(s) may or may not be caring for the child from day to day. <em>See also “caregiver” to understand how that person could be someone other than a child’s “parent.”</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Parental Rights:</span> Parents (see definition above) have a lot of legal rights with respect to their minor children, including the right to live with, care for, and make decisions for their children under the age of 18. These rights are called “parental rights.” In some situations, a parent’s rights can be temporarily put on hold and/or given to someone else (such as a legal guardian). In extreme situations, a parent’s rights may be taken away permanently (through the termination of parental rights and adoption of the child by another person or family). However, parents have the right to special legal protections before their legal rights can be changed or taken away without their permission.<span class="emphasisheavy">Petition/Petitioner:</span> A petition is a legal document that asks a judge to do or not do something. A petitioner is the person (or people) who asks the judge to do this, by filing the petition in court. <span class="emphasisheavy">Restraining Order (Protective Order):</span> A restraining order is a court order from a judge that can protect someone from being physically harmed, threatened, stalked, or harassed. The person who asks for and is protected by the restraining order is called the “protected person” (or protected party). The person whom the restraining order is against is called the “restrained person” (or restrained party). <em>There are several types of restraining orders:</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Domestic violence restraining order:</span> if someone is the victim of domestic violence, they can request a domestic violence restraining order.<span class="emphasisheavy">Personal conduct order:</span> This type of order prohibits (stops) the restrained person from doing specific acts towards the protected person. For example, the order may prohibit the restrained person from contacting, stalking, sexually assaulting, or destroying property of the protected person. <span class="emphasisheavy">Stay-away order</span>: This type of order requires the restrained person to stay a certain distance away from the protected person and/or from a specific place (such as the protected person’s house or workplace).<span class="emphasisheavy">Residence exclusion order</span>: This type of order requires the restrained person to move out from where the protected person lives, and to take only their own clothing or personal belongings until there is a court hearing. <span class="emphasisheavy">Reunification</span>: Reunification can mean 2 things: In the real world (i.e., outside of court), reunification can mean reuniting with your child and (re)developing a relationship with him/her. In court, reunification means getting back your legal right to care for your child, after s/he has been removed by CPS.<span class="emphasisheavy">Removal</span>: When CPS or a judge takes a child away from his/her parent’s custody. <span class="emphasisheavy">Visitation</span>: Visitation is the legal right to spend time with your child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2201" id="footnote-ref-2201">[2201]</a></sup></sup> When a judge makes a custody order, he/she must give visitation rights to the parent who does not have custody of the child, unless granting visitation is not in the child’s best interest.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2202" id="footnote-ref-2202">[2202]</a></sup></sup>Now that you’ve learned some of the basics, keep reading to learn more about the child custody, child visitation, the court system, guardianship, other legal issues related to families and partnerships, and child support.</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="FC_I_ImpactOfCR"></a><a id="_Toc317247460"></a><a id="_Toc448153560"></a><a id="_Toc312427079"></a><a id="_Toc314389679"></a><a id="_Toc302383745"></a><a id="_Toc304118840"></a>The Impact of a Criminal Record on a Legal Case About Your Child or Grandchild</h1><h3><a id="_Toc317247461"></a><a id="_Toc448153561"></a>What is a criminal record?</h3><p class="text">Before we jump deep into family law issues, we think it’s important to understand what a “criminal record” is. In the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029, we go into more detail about what a criminal record is and who can access it. Here is a quick summary.Your “criminal record” is the broad term used to describe <em>any contact</em> you have had with law enforcement, the courts, or another part of the criminal justice system that was written down (recorded). Your entire criminal record includes: arrests (whether or not they led to a conviction), any criminal charges filed against you, convictions (felonies or misdemeanors, even if they get “expunged”), pleas, acquittals (“not guilty” findings), dismissals, sentences, periods of incarceration in jail or prison, and any other contact with the criminal justice system. BUT—and this is an important but—not everyone can see this entire record because some criminal records are <em>protected under certain circumstances.</em> To learn more about criminal records, go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER on PG. 717.</p><a id="FC_Intro_howwillmyCRaffectabilityreconne"></a><a id="_Toc317247462"></a><a id="_Toc448153562"></a><h3>How will my criminal record impact my ability to reconnect with my child or grandchild?</h3><h4 class="sidebox">What are examples of legal cases involving children?</h4><p class="sidebox">Examples of legal cases involving children include cases about: custody, visitation, ending a marriage, adoption, guardianship, CPS/dependency cases, and fostering a child.

Examples of when courts get involved include cases of divorce or legal separation; cases about paternity/parentage; disagreements about custody, visitation, or child support; when one or both parents are no longer able to care for a child because they are sick, disabled, incarcerated, or passed away; or the court is supervising a child’s care due to allegations of abuse or neglect.In most cases, incarceration will affect your relationship with your family, and the courts may end up getting involved to decide who should have the legal right to make decisions about your child or grandchild, and who should be able to visit or care for your child or grandchild. While you are/were incarcerated, it’s possible that there were changes in your child’s care that had nothing to do with your actual conviction, but the courts got involved either because there was already an open case about the child, someone asked the court to get involved, OR the county’s Child Protective Services (CPS) deemed it necessary for the court to oversee the care of your child because of abuse or neglect allegations.If a court case is opened about the care of your child, it is important to know that everything in your criminal record will be available to the judge in that case. But the judge doesn’t look only at your criminal record; s/he looks at your record as one factor among MANY factors about whom is best suited to care for your child, and what is in the child’s “best interest.” To learn about the convictions that may ban you from reunifying with a child, see the chart on PG. 797.

Just because your situation <em>seems to fit into the description of cases that happen in one type of court…</em>does not mean the case will definitely be heard and decided by a judge in that court. Family law cases can be long, complicated, and difficult to navigate. Every case is different and every county handles cases dealing with family and children a little bit differently.

Individuals who want to become a child’s legal guardian, such as relatives or family friends, may file guardianship petitions in this court for temporary or permanent guardianship. This does <em>not</em> end the parent’s rights, but instead puts them on <em>pause.</em><span class="emphasisitalic">(3) Juvenile court</span> includes two divisions: <em>dependency</em> and <em>delinquency</em>.</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Dependency court</span> handles cases of child abuse and neglect, also called CPS cases. The government agency Child Protective Services (CPS) opens a case in dependency court if someone reports that a child may be at risk. (Note: CPS can have different names in each county of California; it is often called the Department of Child and Family Services). If a child is at risk at home, the dependency court may take over custody of the child. A child is sometimes called a “ward” of the dependency court.NOTE: <span class="emphasisitalic">Delinquency court</span> makes decisions in cases where a child (under the age of 18) is arrested and charged with a crime. This court may send the young person to juvenile hall as a punishment for breaking the law.

At the jurisdiction hearing the judge will decide whether the allegations in the petition are true. If the judge decides the allegations are true, the court will take authority over your child. This is called jurisdiction in the law; that is why the hearing is called the jurisdiction hearing. Disposition is the part of the case where the judge will decide what you should do to make things better for your family and your child. This is called the reunification plan.<strong>Hearings that seek to terminate their parental rights:</strong>Hearings that seek to terminate parental rights are formal meetings in front of a judge about ending the right a parent has to see and care for their child. If a parent's rights are terminated, that parent can no longer make legal, medical or general life decisions for the child. In the eyes of the law, the child is no longer that parent's child. Examples of the types of cases that could end a parent's right include: adoption, petition terminating the parental rights of alleged father, or a petition for emancipation.</ol><p class="text">Under state law, the judge should <em>automatically</em> make an order for you to be transported to these types of hearings. The court MUST send a copy of the “transport order” to the warden or sheriff of your facility at least 15 days before the date you need transportation. If you do not receive this order, or if you want to be transported to court for other dependency court hearings, you can write to the court to request such an order, or ask the attorney representing you to request one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2263" id="footnote-ref-2263">[2263]</a></sup></sup><a id="FamilyChildren_SupervisionReconnect"></a><a id="_Toc308433778"></a><a id="_Toc308701458"></a><a id="_Toc309293923"></a></p><h3><a id="_Toc312427111"></a><a id="_Toc314389721"></a><a id="_Toc317247493"></a><a id="_Toc448153593"></a>I am currently incarcerated.

However, we recommend trying to come to an informal agreement with the child’s caregiver for visits to your facility. Filing a lawsuit is a timely and costly process that can cause confrontation in your family. If you have an informal visiting schedule then you are more likely to have an amicable relationship with the child’s guardian. Once you have a successful visit or two, you can ask the caregiver for a <em>reasonable schedule for visits</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2264" id="footnote-ref-2264">[2264]</a></sup></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT!

If that is your situation, you can follow the steps for starting or joining a case in any of the three family-related courts (see PG 817 or how to start or join a case). Grandparents, because they do not have any automatic right to visitation, cannot ask the court for visitation with their grandchild while they are incarcerated, but may be able to set up an informal agreement with the child’s parent or caregiver to come visit them.</p><a id="_Toc314389707"></a><a id="_Toc317247494"></a><a id="FC_VII_FamiluCourt"></a><a id="_Toc448153594"></a><h2>Family Court<a id="_Toc317247495"></a></h2><h4 class="textbox">What will I learn about family court?</h4><ul class="learn-bullets">Why you would need to go to family court to reconnect with your child or grandchild.How a judge’s decisions in family court can affect your rights as a parent or grandparent.How a judge will decide if you can have custody or visitation with your child or grandchild, and how the rights of parents are different from the rights of grandparents in family court.Which convictions may bar you from reconnecting with your child or grandchild in family court.How you can show a judge in family court that custody or visitation with you is in the “best interest of the child.”How to show mitigating circumstances related to your criminal record.How to reconnect with your child or grandchild without going to family court.</ul><h3><a id="_Toc448153595"></a>What is family court?</h3><p class="text">Family court is the court system that handles cases involving married couples or domestic partners and their children, if they have any.

This means that you can be the child’s biological parent but not the “legal parent,” OR you can be the child’s legal parent even if you are <em>not</em> the biological parent. There are specific legal rules for deciding whom the child’s legal parents are—in other words, rules for establishing paternity/parentage (these legal rules are also called “presumptions”).When a child is born, the woman who gives birth to the child (the child’s biological or “natural mother”) is automatically the child’s legal parent. But the child does not another legal parent until paternity/parentage is established according to these legal rules. Even if someone is the child’s biological parent (and can prove it), if he was never married to the mother of the child, they are not considered the child’s legal parent and do not have any legal rights or responsibilities for the child UNLESS paternity/parentage is legally established according to these presumptions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2379" id="footnote-ref-2379">[2379]</a></sup> To learn more about how paternity/parentage is established, keep reading this section.For same-sex couples, if a couple conceives through assisted reproduction (i.e. with a sperm or egg donor) than the non-biological parent is treated by law as if they were the legal parent of the child as long as there is consent in writing signed by both parents.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2380" id="footnote-ref-2380">[2380]</a></sup></sup> The couple does not need to be married to meet this standard.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2381" id="footnote-ref-2381">[2381]</a></sup></sup> Non-biological parents can also establish parentage if they received the child into their home and openly held them out to be their natural child, or were married at the time the child was born, but to establish legal parentage this way you would need to go to court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2382" id="footnote-ref-2382">[2382]</a></sup></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153663"></a>Why does legal paternity/parentage matter? </h3><p class="text">Establishing paternity/parentage gives you and your child many rights, including a right to child support, access to your child’s medical records, public benefits for you and the child, and more. Once parentage is established, a family-related court (family court, probate court, or dependency court) can make orders for custody, visitation, child support, health insurance, name changes, and reimbursement of pregnancy and birth costs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2383" id="footnote-ref-2383">[2383]</a></sup></sup> Until parentage is established, the court can’t make orders about these issues.</p><h3><a id="_Toc312427145"></a><a id="_Toc314389766"></a><a id="_Toc317247565"></a><a id="_Toc448153664"></a>What does paternity have to do with my reentry?</h3><p class="text">There are two reasons why paternity/parentage can be important in reentry:</p><ol class="text">Only biological or adoptive parents have legal rights to care to for and making decisions about their child. You may have an informal agreement if you are not the biological parent, but you cannot go to court to ask a judge for (more) custody or visitation. However, if you are not the biological or adoptive parent of the child, you can seek custody or visitation by asking a judge in court to become a guardian or foster parent. For information on how to become a guardian, see PG. 830. For information on how to become a foster parent, see PG. 842. If you are the biological or adoptive parent, you may have child support obligations. For more on child support obligations, see PG. 860. </ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If a person is established as a legal parent of a child, that person MUST financially support the child. It is a crime for a legal parent to fail to support his or her child.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2384" id="footnote-ref-2384">[2384]</a></sup></strong> A legal parent also has the right to get custody or visitation rights related to the child.

After establishing paternity, a parent with a criminal record may be limited or completely denied some or all of the benefits of paternity at the time of the court hearing OR may have to establish a record of good behavior to do things like visit the child.

For help to find either your family law/self-help facilitator or LSCA, see Appendix A, PG. 881. </p><h3><a id="_Toc312427178"></a><a id="_Toc314389804"></a><a id="_Toc317247606"></a><a id="_Toc448153705"></a>Do my spousal support payments automatically begin when I am released from prison? </h3><p class="text">Because your spousal support payments do not automatically stop while you are incarcerated, then your release will not cause the payments to automatically begin.

In the same way that many taxes are taken out, an “earning assignment” or wage garnishment is removed directly from your paycheck and is considered payment for your court spousal order (and/or child support order).<sup><a href="#footnote-2460" id="footnote-ref-2460">[2460]</a></sup> </p><ol class="text">If you also have a child support earnings assignment in place, child support will be taken from your check first.

This may happen because you or your former spouse’s job changed, you or your former spouse does not need support any more, or you would like to make changes because the spouse that is paying cannot afford to pay the ordered amount. When deciding whether to change the order, a judge will look to determine if there is are “changes in circumstances.” </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Unless the judge signs a new court order, the existing spousal or partner support amount and order will not be changed. So, to protect yourself, even if you have a verbal agreement with your spouse/domestic partner to change the spousal or partner support amount, put it in writing and have a judge sign it. That way you have a current spousal or partner support order that reflects the current amount.</p><p class="text">IMMEDIATELY! It takes time for the courts to process paperwork and/or to schedule a hearing before a judge to change court orders and you do not want to get into trouble if your circumstances have changed and now it is difficult to pay.

If you cannot afford a lawyer, ask the court to appoint one for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2465" id="footnote-ref-2465">[2465]</a></sup>If you are able to show that you are not able to pay before the court, you will probably not be held in contempt (which can lead to jail time).

After mediation, the judge must sign this agreement in court to make it official. In some cases, the judge will make changes that he or she believes are in the “best interest of the child.”<sup><a href="#footnote-2480" id="footnote-ref-2480">[2480]</a></sup></p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Child custody mediation may not be appropriate in cases of domestic violence.

You may also meet with the mediator more than once.If the parents are able to agree, the mediator helps the parents write a custody and visitation plan. <em>If the custody and visitation plan is signed by the judge</em>, this plan becomes an official court order. But it’s not official until signed by the judge.In some counties in California, the mediator will make <em>recommendations</em>, as well, and may provide that written recommendation to the judge.</p><div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383782"></a><a id="_Toc304118877"></a><a id="_Toc311903203"></a>Who is the mediator in child custody mediation? </div><p class="text">A mediator is a person who has been professionally trained (usually has a graduate degree) to help resolve disagreements between two people figuring out parenting plans, and knows a lot about the California family court system.The mediator will not and <em>cannot</em> know you or the other parent/caregiver because he or she is supposed to listen to both of you <em>equally and fairly</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2483" id="footnote-ref-2483">[2483]</a></sup> The mediator helps you decide when the children will be with each parent, how future decisions about your children will be made and will help you consider the best way to protect your children’s safety and well-being.<sup><a href="#footnote-2484" id="footnote-ref-2484">[2484]</a></sup>The mediator may also have additional information about community services that may be helpful to you and your child(ren).</p><div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc304118878"></a><a id="_Toc311903204"></a><a id="_Toc302383783"></a>How do I find a mediator? </div><p class="text">You can find low-cost mediators on the following website: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-familycourtservices.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-familycourtservices.htm</a> (organized by county).</p><div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc304118879"></a><a id="_Toc311903205"></a>I do not speak English and/or English is not my first language.

In some local family courts, mediators make recommendations to the judge about child custody and visitation. In these courts, if you and the other parent cannot agree on a parenting plan through mediation, the mediator is asked to give the court a written recommendation. This recommendation will contain the mediator’s opinion about what parenting arrangement will be in your children’s best interest. Both you and the other parent (or caregiver) will also get a copy of the mediator’s recommendation.In other courts, mediation is confidential and the mediators do NOT make a recommendation to the court about child custody and visitation. If the parents agree on any issues, the mediator may provide the court with a written summary that summarizes the issues that the parents agree on.Usually, mediators interview both sides together, but if there has been domestic violence or there is a restraining order between the parents or other concerns about meeting together, the parents may ask to meet with the mediator separately. Sometimes, even when there is no domestic violence, the mediator may decide it is more appropriate and helpful to meet separately with each parent. The special rules about mediation allow the mediator to do this.</p><div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383784"></a><a id="_Toc304118881"></a><a id="_Toc311903207"></a>Is child custody mediation confidential?</div><p class="text">It depends on the court.The things you tell your mediator, either alone and/or with your child’s caregiver, may not be kept secret (confidential). Ask for information <em>in writing</em> as to whether your conversations will be kept secret or shared with others. You can also ask the Family Law Facilitator about confidentiality and mediation.</p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If a mediator suspects that there is child abuse or has concerns about the physical safety of the child(ren), he or she may need to report the case to the local child protective services (CPS) or the court.</p><div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383785"></a><a id="_Toc304118882"></a><a id="_Toc311903208"></a>will we be forced to make an agreement in the child custody mediation appointment? </div><p class="text">No. You will not be forced or required to make an agreement if you participate in child custody mediation.

If neither parent has a lawyer, the mediator or the parents will give the agreement to the judge to approve and sign. When the judge signs it, it becomes an official court order. However, if you do have a lawyer, ask your lawyer any questions you have and ask your lawyer to review your written agreement BEFORE you sign it.<strong>If you and the other parent/caregiver do NOT reach an agreement on your parenting/caregiving plan, the following may happen:</strong></p><ol class="text">There may be a court hearing or settlement conference with the judge to resolve issues.The judge may make decisions on a parenting plan for you.The judge may order a child custody evaluation by a mental health professional to get more information before making a decision.

If after reading the recommended sections of this Chapter, you would like to open a case in Family Court, the information below will help you understand how to begin or join a family court case.<strong>Types of Petitions (court forms) for starting a case in Family Court:</strong></p><ol class="text"><strong>Petition for divorce or legal separation (FL-100):</strong> If you were married and now want to be divorced from the other parent who has custody of your child, you will file for divorce in family court. For more information of divorce or legal separation, see PG. 911. <strong>Petition for Dissolution of civil partnership/legal separation (FL-103):</strong> If you were in a domestic partnership (a same-sex relationship registered with the State of California) and now want to legally terminate that partnership from the other parent who has custody of your child, you would file for dissolution of domestic partnership in family court. For more information of divorce or legal separation, see PG. 911. <strong>Petition for custody and support of minor children (FL-260):</strong> If you were unmarried and the parentage of your child has already been officially established, then you can file a petition for custody and support of minor children in family court. <sup><a href="#footnote-2486" id="footnote-ref-2486">[2486]</a></sup> <strong>Petition to establish parental relationship (FL-200):</strong> If you were unmarried and the parentage of your child has not already been established in family court, then you an file a petition to establish parental relationship. If you have any questions about starting a case and/or if you need help with deciding which form to pick and file, and/or what kind of case you should bring to family court, you can and should contact: a lawyer, the Family Law Facilitator who works at your county family court, (See Appendix A, PG. 881, to find your local Family Law Facilitator), and/or a legal aid provider.</ol><h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTSAssistance, Forms, &amp; Fees in Family Court</h4><ul class="textbox">Family court forms for requesting custody and visitation are available on the California Courts’ website at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1192.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1192.htm</a>.If you have general questions or need assistance filling out your court forms, ask the court Family Law Facilitator to help you. If you have questions about your specific case or circumstances, you should talk to a lawyer.Filing the court papers to request custody or visitation can be very expensive ($400-$500). If you cannot afford to pay this, you can request a fee waiver from the court clerk when you file your papers. Once you file the forms by mailing them to the family court or bringing them to the court in person, you must wait and make sure the family court accepts your forms, that the documents were acceptable. Once you receive notice that the family court accepted the forms, you can move to STEP 4. </ul><h4 class="step">File all of the necessary forms with the family court to join or start a new case. Depending on the court, you may have to file your court forms in personOnce you receive notice from the family court that your forms were acceptable, you must serve a copy of the forms you filed as well as a response form on the person you are bringing a court case against in family court, usually here it will be your child’s other parent. When a case in family court is first filed, it must be personally served on the other party or parties. This means that you cannot mail the forms, but have to find someone to hand deliver the forms to whomever you are suing. This is called “service of process.” Any adult over the age of 18 can do this for you. Form more information on service of process in family court, see . Once the family court accepts your forms and you serve the papers on the other party or parties in the case, the judge in family court will order one, two or all three of the following: <strong>Schedule a hearing you must attend and/or Require you and the other parent to attend a mediationAnd/or order a custody evaluation. </strong></h4><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT!: Completing STEP 5 means you are now involved in an active custody and/or visitation case involving your child. Family court cases, like all court cases, require a lot of paperwork, documents, and forms. Navigating all the court forms and processes can be, and often is, very confusing. We are trying to simplify this process for you by not bogging you down with details on each step mentioned above. As a result, we strongly recommend you get help from another person or organization that specializes in understanding the family court process. They can and will help with all the specifics on forms, documents, paperwork and processes.

Other examples might include: completing an anger management or domestic violence program and taking steps to fix any previous harm you caused; completing a drug rehabilitation program and staying sober for a year or more; and avoiding criminal activity or arrest for several years<strong> </strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2494" id="footnote-ref-2494">[2494]</a></sup> </p><p class="text">POSSIBILITY #2: If it has been several years since your reunification services ended:You must go to family court and file papers asking to change the juvenile dependency court order.

It is used when parents of a child who are not married want to establish themselves as the child’s legal parent. A properly signed Declaration of Paternity has the same effect as a court order from the judge. <sup><a href="#footnote-2539" id="footnote-ref-2539">[2539]</a></sup></p><div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383836"></a><a id="_Toc304118940"></a>Where can I get help in establishing parentage? </div><p class="text">Your Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) can bring an action to establish the paternity/ parentage of your child. As part of this action, they will ask the court for a child support order. This service is free and is available to both parents. To begin, call the LCSA and ask for an appointment to open a case for parentage and support. You can open a case during the pregnancy and a genetic test can be ordered (if the other person denies being the parent) after the child is born. Also, when one parent is on welfare for the children (for example, if they receive Cal-Works or Medi-Cal), the LCSA automatically gets involved and opens a case.<sup><a href="#footnote-2540" id="footnote-ref-2540">[2540]</a></sup>You may also want to contact your local department of child support services, registrar of births, family law facilitator or welfare office. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The local child support agency (LCSA) can be a helpful resource but they are not your lawyers and the information you provide will not be kept secret (confidential). The LSCA can also share certain information to other agencies, the other parent or your employer. If you need more advice or privacy, it would be best to contact a lawyer and/or your local legal aid office. <strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2541" id="footnote-ref-2541">[2541]</a></sup></strong></p><div class="appendix"><a id="FC_AppJ_DivorceLegalSeparation"></a>Appendix J</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="FC_TOC_AppJ"></a>Divorce or Legal Separation: Filing, Responding &amp; Completing </div><p class="text">Basic steps to file for a divorce or legal separation:</p><ol class="text">Fill our your court forms (see the next section): To file for divorce or legal separation, you have to fill out the same forms. If you want specific legal advice about how to fill out your court forms, talk to a lawyer. What you write on your court papers can be very important and can affect the outcome of the case. It is very important to be accurate and complete, and a lawyer can help you figure out how to fill out the forms so that they accurately reflect your position. This is especially important if you think you and your spouse or domestic partner are likely to have disagreements about the issues that the court forms ask you about.File your forms: Turn in your forms (the originals AND copies) to the court clerk. If there are no obvious errors, the clerk will take the original of each form and return the copies to you, stamped “Filed.”</ol><p class="text">You will have to pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford the fee, you can <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-feewaiver.htm">ask for a fee waiver</a>. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want the judge to make temporary orders for child or spousal support, bill payment, protection from domestic violence, or other issues, you must fill out and file other forms with the order form for a divorce or dissolution of marriage. Talk to your family law facilitator or self-help center to ask for help with temporary orders.</p><ol class="text">Serve your court papers: The law says your spouse or domestic partner must be told that you have started the legal process for a divorce, legal separation, or annulment. To do this, you must “serve” your spouse or domestic partner with copies of all your court papers. The judge CANNOT make any orders or judgments in your divorce or legal separation case until your spouse or domestic partner has been properly “served.”Fill out and serve your financial disclosure forms: You have filed your petition in your divorce or legal separation case. Now, you are ready to complete the financial disclosures needed to get divorced or legally separated. Keep in mind that you can provide your financial disclosures at the same time as your petition if you wish, but NO LATER than 60 days after filing your petition.The next steps all depend on whether or not your spouse or domestic partner has responded to your service. Please see the Judicial Council of California’s website here: for more information on what to do next, or speak to your court’s family law facilitator or an attorney.</ol><p class="text">Basic Steps to Responding to a Divorce or Legal Separation: </p><ol class="text">Either spouse in a marriage or partner in a registered domestic partnership can ask the court to end their legal relationship.If you have been served with a petition and summons for dissolution (divorce) or legal separation, your spouse or domestic partner is asking the court to end your relationship. In California, as long as 1 person wants to end the marriage or domestic partnership, the court can end it, even if the other spouse or domestic partner does not agree or want to get divorced or legally separated.You can either respond by contesting the divorce or dissolution or you can respond by not contesting it, meaning you agree and have no changes to make to the request. </ol><h3 class="subheading3">The Forms</h3><p class="text">There are a lot of California forms that must be completed if you are filing, responding, or completing a divorce or legal separation. You may also have special forms that must be completed depending on the county you live in. To find your county, please see Appendix A on PG. X to find your county. It is VERY important that all of you forms are completed and filed at the right time. To make sure you follow and complete all the steps, you can talk to a lawyer or a family law facilitator to help. Below is a list of forms that you will have to complete whether you are filing or responding to a divorce. </p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Petition</span> — <span class="emphasisitalic">Marriage/Domestic Partnership</span> (Form FL-100). On this form, you give the court some basic information about your marriage and/or domestic partnership, and you ask for the orders you want the court to make.<span class="emphasisitalic">Summons (Family Law)</span> (Form FL-110). This form contains important information for you and for your spouse or domestic partner about the divorce or separation process. It contains some standard restraining orders limiting what you can do with your property, money, and other assets or debts. It also prohibits you or your spouse or domestic partner from moving out of state with your children from your marriage or partnership, and from applying for a new or replacement passport for any of your children together, without the prior written consent of the other or a court order. And it lets you know that if you or someone in your household need affordable health insurance, you can apply for Covered California. READ this form carefully!!</ol><h3 class="subheading3">Declaration Paperwork</h3><p class="text">There may be things you must “declare” meaning you are to tell your spouse and/or the court what you have in order to get a divorce. Below are various forms you may also need to complete.</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Property Declaration (Family Law)</span> (Form FL-160). Use this form if you need more space to list your property and debts. <span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)</span> (Form FL-105/GC-120). Use this form if you have child under the age 18 with your spouse or domestic partner. <span class="emphasisitalic">Child Custody and Visitation Application Attachment</span> (Form FL-311). Use this form if you want to ask the court to make orders about custody and visitation at the time of your divorce. It is an optional form (you do not have to use it).</ol><h3 class="subheading3">Service Paperwork</h3><p class="text">An important part of filing for divorce is “service” which is also considered notification or how the other spouse and, or the local child support agency is told that you want a divorce. Below are forms that you may need:</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt (Family Law)</span> (Form FL-117). Use this form if you decide to do service by mail. This form shows the court that your spouse or domestic partner received your forms. If your spouse or domestic partner does not sign, date, and return this form, you will have to have him or her served again by personal service. Remember, you must have someone 18 years or older (NOT you) and not involved in the divorce (NOT a family, friend, or relative) do this for you. <span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service by Mail to the Local Child Support Agency</span><strong> (Form FL-335).</strong> This form is used when you must serve the LSCA because either you or your spouse receives money or help from the government for a child in your relationship or if you have a current custody case taking place with the LSCA. <span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service of Summons</span> (Form FL-115). This form must be completed whether you decide to have someone hand deliver divorce papers or mail them for you. It is very important your server fills out the Proof of Service correctly. If possible, have your family law facilitator or self-help center review it to make sure it was filled out properly.</ol><h3 class="subheading3">Financial Disclosure Forms</h3><p class="text">In California, you and your spouse must give each other written information on what property or money you have and what expenses you have. This must be done so the property between two people can be split up equally. It also gives you financial information in order to make decisions about child support. If financial disclosures are not exchanged or if the financial disclosures are not correct, the divorce can be cancelled and the court can make orders about the propertyThere are two times when a disclosure occurs: (1) At the time of filing (preliminary disclosure), and (2) at the end of the divorce (final disclosure).Below is a list of official court forms and other things you may need. </p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration of Disclosure. </span>(Form FL-140). This is the form that you will use to write down your expenses. It must be sent to your spouse within 60 days of filing for divorce. This form will not be filed with the court, only given to your spouse. <span class="emphasisitalic">Schedule of Assets and Debts</span> (Form FL-142) or a <span class="emphasisitalic">Property Declaration</span> (Form FL-160); This form will not be filed with the court, only given to your spouse. <span class="emphasisitalic">Income and Expense Declaration</span> (Form FL-150).

This form tells the court that you have given your spouse or domestic partner the preliminary or final declaration of disclosure. This form will be filed with the court. </ol><p class="text">There are a lot of steps to completing a divorce or dissolution of marriage.

Education can open doors, create opportunities, and lead to better and more stable employment. This Chapter is a roadmap to help you start (or continue) planning so that you can reach your educational goals. It discusses what programs, schools, and financial aid opportunities are available, and it takes you through the process of deciding what is right for you. The advice here is intended to be practical both for people who are currently incarcerated, as well as for people who were formerly incarcerated and have returned to the community.<em>NOTE FOR READERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED: </em>Throughout this guide, we will often suggest that you “call” the resource that you need. We understand that it might not be possible for you to make these phone calls yourself while you are incarcerated, however we offer it as general information for you, your family, and your advocates to use for your benefit.</p><h4 class="textbox">DID YOU KNOW? </h4><p class="textbox">Studies show that formerly incarcerated people who receive general education or vocational training are much less likely to return to prison and much more likely to find employment after their release. In fact, people who participate in correctional education programs while incarcerated have a 43 percent <em>lower</em> chance of returning to prison, and a 13 percent <em>higher</em> chance of finding employment, than people who do not do educational programs while incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2544" id="footnote-ref-2544">[2544]</a></sup> </p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153730"></a>Questions to start with</h1><p class="text">Thinking through the following questions will help you set your educational goals and decide which path is best for you. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153731"></a>What are my educational options?</h3><p class="text">Your decision about which school or program you enroll in will depend on many factors: your personal and career goals, your finances, your educational background and current skills, and your ability to overcome any barriers that may arise because of your criminal history. Your decision may also depend on day-to-day needs—such as your health, family responsibilities, access to transportation, and parole or probation conditions.  To start, here is an overview of the educational options this Chapter will cover:</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes</span> (PG. 951) improve your basic math, reading, writing, and life skills; and these classes can help you get ready for high school-level work.<span class="emphasisitalic">High school credentials (diploma or GED)</span> (PG. 953) are a minimum requirement for many jobs, and are a necessary step before you can continue your education through a Career Technical Education program or a college or university degree. You can earn a high school credential by completing a high school diploma program or passing the GED test.<span class="emphasisitalic">Career Technical Education (CTE) programs</span> (PG. 961) train you for specific kinds of jobs, and sometimes lead to certificates or professional/occupational licenses that you need for those jobs. Different programs take different lengths of time, but they’re often designed so that you can complete them in 1 year.<span class="emphasisitalic">College Degree: </span>Two-year and four-year colleges and universities award college degrees (also called academic degrees) for completing a program of academic study. College degree programs usually do not train you for a specific type of job, but give you a wide variety of general skills that are useful for many different professions. The different types of college (academic) degrees are: associate, and bachelor’s.<span class="emphasisitalic">Two-year college (associate degree) programs</span> (PG. 966) allow you to earn an associate degree, which can be a stepping-stone to entry-level jobs or to a four-year college program. Note: Part-time students will take longer than 2 years.<span class="emphasisitalic">Four-year college and university programs</span> (PG. 965) allow you to earn a bachelor’s degree, which can be a stepping-stone to higher-level jobs or to graduate or professional school. Note: Part-time students will take longer than 4 years.<span class="emphasisitalic">Graduate or professional schools</span> allow you to earn advanced degrees after you’ve earned a bachelor’s degree. Earning a professional degree allows you to become licensed to work in professions like law or medicine; the kinds of jobs it can lead to depends on your field of study.<sup><a href="#footnote-2545" id="footnote-ref-2545">[2545]</a></sup> Earning a master’s degree generally takes 2 years, and a doctorate degree can take 3 years or more.</ol><h4>here are suggested steps as you plan your educational path:</h4><table><tr><td colspan="7"><p class="tableheadingmedium">1.

The programs and resources available to you will be different based on whether you’re incarcerated in a federal prison, state prison, or county jail. In addition, the availability of programs and resources will be different across different facilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-2548" id="footnote-ref-2548">[2548]</a></sup> In general, the following programs will be available to you:</p><ol class="text">If you’re in a federal prison, you should have free access to assessment testing, ABE classes (including literacy and ESL), GED programs,<sup><a href="#footnote-2549" id="footnote-ref-2549">[2549]</a></sup> CTE and job readiness programs,<sup><a href="#footnote-2550" id="footnote-ref-2550">[2550]</a></sup> as well as a College Coordinator who can help you enroll in and complete correspondence (mail) courses.<sup><a href="#footnote-2551" id="footnote-ref-2551">[2551]</a></sup>If you’re in a California state prison, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provides free access to assessment testing, ABE classes (including literacy and ESL), GED programs, high school diploma programs, CTE and job readiness programs, occupational licensing, library services, and tutoring support programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2552" id="footnote-ref-2552">[2552]</a></sup> If you’re incarcerated in a California county jail, California law gives individuals counties permission (and resources) to establish education programs in all adult county correctional facilities and to award diplomas and certificates for completion of study in these programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2553" id="footnote-ref-2553">[2553]</a></sup> However, the law does not require that the counties do so, or control how those programs are to be structured. Therefore, the availability and quality of educational programs varies from county to county.<sup><a href="#footnote-2554" id="footnote-ref-2554">[2554]</a></sup> If you are incarcerated in county jail, you will need to check with your facility to see what educational programs are available to you.</ol><p class="textbox">For details about the different programs that might be available while you are incarcerated, read the section on Learning the Educational Landscape, starting on PG. 951. Even if you don’t have access to programs or classes that are right for you while you’re incarcerated, there are programs you can complete on your own through correspondence courses or self-study. There are also practical steps you can take while incarcerated to prepare for your education after release.</p><p class="text">For information about correspondence and self-study courses, see PG. 977. For information on preparing for your post-release education while you are still incarcerated, see PG. 943.</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153734"></a>Practical tips</h1><p class="text">The process of pursuing your education—not to mention the larger process of transitioning back into your community—can be rewarding, but also challenging and stressful at times. You’ll be dealing with a lot of forms, applications, and procedures and this may feel overwhelming. Here are some tips for staying on track throughout this process: </p><ol class="text">Gather and organize all the documents you will need for applying to schools and programs, financial aid, and employment (see list of documents below PG. 932). Keep all your important documents together, and use a large envelope or folder to store them. Keeping these papers clean, safe, and organized will save you lots of time and frustration.<sup><a href="#footnote-2555" id="footnote-ref-2555">[2555]</a></sup> Getting some of these documents may require lots of paperwork, a long application process, or lots of follow-up efforts, so if you are able to gather these documents as soon as possible, take advantage of this and gather them to save you time. (For details about these documents—what they are and how to get them—see the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21.) Take the time to make informed decisions. Before committing to any school or program, get as much information as possible and consider your options carefully. Do background research at the library or on the Internet, ask questions to people who have been through the program or know of its reputation, beware of scams and bogus credentials, and investigate ways to save time and money. Ask for help! Get advice from the people who are there to help you. If you are currently incarcerated, talk to the education staff, counselors, and program directors at your facility. Ask friends and family members to do research and gather information for you. If you’re in the community, visit your local public library and look for reentry programs, social service organizations, career centers, and community colleges in your area.</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153735"></a><a id="ED_educationdocuments"></a>What important documents will I need to continue my education?</h3><p class="text">In general, these are the documents you’ll need to have ready as you apply for schools, programs, and financial aid.

You should start by considering your lifestyle and identifying any factors or circumstances that might conflict with a job you are interested in. For example, criminal convictions, family responsibilities, and travel or mobility restrictions can affect whether a particular job or career is a good fit for you.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153747"></a>Does the job or career you are interested in have restrictions against people with criminal records?</h3><p class="text">Some jobs or career fields are prohibited or have limited opportunities for people with certain criminal convictions—called legal job restrictions. Additionally, many jobs in California require you to get a professional/ occupational license in order to work in this job, and many licensing boards have restrictions about issuing licenses to people with certain convictions (see next question for more information). So even though this information can be difficult and frustrating to learn, it will help you to design the best path for yourself—one that you are passionate about but that is also realistic. Given the laws and barriers in place regarding certain professions and license, this information may be useful to consider when making decisions regarding your educational path.

Be patient! There is almost always a way to make it work if you are dedicated to reaching your educational goals. Here are some of the common issues that you might face when pursuing your education while you are still incarcerated, followed by suggestions that can help you achieve your goals in spite of the challenges:</p><div class="headingboldunderl11">The programs I need are just not available.</div><p class="text">The quality and availability of programs for different educational needs varies greatly from facility to facility. Additionally, even if your facility offers the program you want, there are often long waitlists to get enrolled. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion</span>: Try supplementing your coursework with a correspondence course or related self-study. If you are waiting to get into a class, find out what the students are learning about—maybe you can get a head start!</p><div class="headingboldunderl11">The prison mail system is getting in the way.</div><p class="text">If you decide to pursue your education through a correspondence course, or if you want to create your own self-study program, you may find that the prison mail system is frustrating your efforts. Materials and assignments may be slow in getting to you, and some items may not get to you at all because they are not allowed by your facility. All of this could mean significant delays in your studies or prevent you from completing them at all. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Be patient. There is no time limit on most correspondence courses—you can take as long as you need to complete the coursework. The goal is to learn the materials and pass the class, no matter how long it takes. Slow progress is still progress! If you find that your facility is overly restrictive in what materials it will allow in, try writing to the correspondence course administrator to explain your situation. See if he or she can put the materials into a format that your facility will be less likely to object to. (For a list of schools with a history of successfully offering correspondence courses to incarcerated people, see Appendix D, PG. 1001.) </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t afford the cost of programs and/or materials.</div><p class="text">For any program or course that is not offered by the facility directly, you will be responsible for the cost of any necessary books, materials, or course fees. If you cannot afford these expenses, you may be prevented from participating in the program or taking the course. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Try to find someone else at your facility who is taking or has taken the course. See if that person is willing to share materials with you or donate them to you when he or she is done. Look into financial aid options to help with your costs. Some forms of financial aid are available while you are incarcerated, and there are even special scholarships to help incarcerated people afford textbooks and materials. (See <em>Paying for Your Education</em>, PG. 980 for more information about these programs.) </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I have limited access to technologies.</div><p class="text">Distance Education courses commonly require that you have access to certain technologies (audio/video equipment, computers, the Internet) in order to participate in the program (except for traditional mail-only correspondence courses). If you don’t have a way to use the media that contains the course content, you won’t be able to take the course. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span><em> </em>Shop around for a course that doesn’t require the use of equipment that you don’t have. Try signing up for a program or activity in your facility that will give you access to the technology you need and will allow you to use it in your spare time (make sure you are authorized to do so!). </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I am not eligible for financial aid.</div><p class="text">Certain types of financial aid are not available to you while you are incarcerated, and other types are not available if you have certain types of convictions.<span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Apply for the types of financial aid that are available to you while you are incarcerated. Plus, while you are incarcerated, you can apply for financial aid that you will become eligible for once you are released, so the money will be ready for you when you get out. (For more information about financial aid, see <em>Paying for your Education</em>, PG. 980.)</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153754"></a>If I am under federal, state, or county supervision, what barriers might I face?</h3><p class="text">While you are under supervision, your parole or probation officer should fully support your efforts to pursue your education.<sup><a href="#footnote-2583" id="footnote-ref-2583">[2583]</a></sup> However, sometimes even the normal conditions of supervision can get in the way, and make it difficult for you to reach your educational goals. Fortunately, there are ways to work around your restrictions and steps you can take to stay on track even while they are in place. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you find that your parole or probation officer is not supportive of your efforts to get an education, or that the conditions of your supervision are so restrictive that they make it impossible for you to pursue your education, this might be a violation of your rights. You should contact an attorney who can advise you and look into getting your restrictive conditions lifted. (For more information, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130.)</p><p class="text">Here are some of the common barriers that you might face when trying to pursue your education while you are under supervision, followed by suggestions that can help you achieve your goals in spite of the challenges:</p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t get to school because I have travel limitations.</div><p class="text">While you are on supervision you may have restrictions on how far you can travel, or you may not have reliable transportation, or you may have to rely on public transportation. All of these factors may limit where you can go to school. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Look into local schools and programs that are easily accessible for you and do not involve a long commute. You can also explore Distance Education and correspondence course options. You may even be able to use the computers at your local public library to take these courses. (For information on Distance Education see PG. 974 or for correspondence courses, see PG. 977. For information on resources at your local public library, see PG. 930.) </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t go to the school I want because I can’t move out of the area.</div><p class="text">Similar to travel restrictions, while you are under supervision, you probably will not be allowed to move outside of the county or the state. If the school you want to go to is in another county or state, you may not be able to attend it. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Again, local schools and programs are your best bet. If you are located in a rural area where your options are severely limited, get started earning credits through Distance Education and correspondence courses. Once you’ve completed your term of supervision, you can transfer to the school you want to attend and bring your earned credits with you. (For information on Distance Education see PG. 974 or for correspondence courses, see PG. 977. For information on transferring credits, see PG. 974.) </p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t fit school into my schedule because of restrictions on my time (“passes,” curfews, work requirements).</div><p class="text">While you are under supervision, you may be restricted in the amount of time you can spend attending classes, or by the hours of the day that you are allowed to be away from home to attend. You may have a curfew imposed on you or you may be required to get a “pass” that is only good for a short period of time in order to leave your residence. You may also be required to work a certain number of hours a day, which leaves little time for school.<span class="emphasisitalic">Solution:</span> If you only have a limited amount of time to attend school each day, consider starting part time instead of full time. Take a class or two, and then build your schedule up when you are able. Also, Distance Education programs and correspondence courses are more flexible and can generally be worked around any schedule.</p><div class="headingboldunderl11">I am required to register as a sex offender.</div><p class="text">If you are required to register as a sex offender, you should still be able to attend the school or program of your choice, but you will need to comply with sex-offender residency restrictions. This means that you cannot live in on-campus housing, and you must live at least 2000 yards from the school campus.<sup><a href="#footnote-2584" id="footnote-ref-2584">[2584]</a></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153755"></a>If I have completed my sentence, and I’m off supervision, what barriers might I still face?</h3><p class="text">Once you have completed your sentence, including any term of supervision, most of the barriers that we have discussed so far will no longer exist for you. Unfortunately, your criminal record may still inhibit or interfere with your educational plans. See PG. 945</p><h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153756"></a><a id="ED_choosingeducationalpath"></a>How to choose the educational path that meets your specific educational goals</h1><h3><a id="_Toc448153757"></a>Once everything is considered, how do I start finding the educational program that is right for me?</h3><p class="text">Whatever education level you are currently at and whatever your future education plans are, the general steps you should follow when deciding on a program are the same. Use these steps to help guide you through your decision-making process. Along the way, you can talk to people around you who can help. Your Correctional Counselor, the staff in the Education Department, a school or career center counselor, and family and friends can provide advice and support throughout this process. </p><h4 class="step">FIND PROGRAMS THAT FIT YOUR NEEDS</h4><p class="text">Obviously, you want to find a program that meets the interests that you identified in the very beginning of this chapter (see “Setting Your Educational Goals,” PG. 935), but in order to find a program that truly fits your needs, must consider the practical factors that will impact your educational experience. You should think through the following questions to help you guide your decision:</p><h4 class="sidebox">Larger Schools v. Smaller Schools</h4><p class="sidebox">Larger schools tend to have more diverse student populations, and a greater variety of extra-curricular activities and clubs. However, you may feel distracted and overwhelmed in this environment, and class size is larger which means less individual attention from the teacher. </p><ol class="text">Do you want to study full or part-time? Is it more important for you to finish the program quickly or do you need to split your class time with other responsibilities? Would you prefer to go to a large school or a smaller school? Do you need to be in a classroom at all, or is distance learning a better option for you? Do you want to go to a public (state-funded) or private (privately owned) school? </ol><h4 class="step">RESEARCH SCHOOL/PROGRAM QUALITY</h4><p class="text">Evaluate the quality of each school or program by following these steps:<sup><a href="#footnote-2585" id="footnote-ref-2585">[2585]</a></sup> </p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Check for “accreditation” and other approval</span>.Find out if the school or program is accredited.

These schools spend lots of money on recruiting, and little on teaching or career services for students. They also tend to charge higher tuition than public community colleges and are likely to leave you with high debt, poor training, and slim chances of finding a job. Following the research steps above will help you avoid these schools.<sup><a href="#footnote-2590" id="footnote-ref-2590">[2590]</a></sup>Similarly, beware of “schools” or “programs” that aren’t real schools or programs, but instead are diploma mills — companies selling diplomas.

Some schools do conduct full criminal background checks on prospective students and then use the information to deny admission to people with criminal records, or give them conditional admission with added requirements and restrictions—kind of like “admission on probation.”<sup><a href="#footnote-2596" id="footnote-ref-2596">[2596]</a></sup> Unfortunately, there is nothing illegal about what they’re doing, and no real legal way to stop them from doing it. The best defense, however, is a good offense—in other words, be proactive! Take steps to clean up your criminal record, participate in rehabilitation programs, and be prepared with answers to questions about your criminal history. (See the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029 for information and details on how to “clean up” your record.)<span class="emphasisitalic">The Good News…</span>Many colleges and universities will let you appeal a denial based on your criminal record, and will work with you to help you get in. Reach out to the Admissions Office staff and to school advisors to show them that you are serious and dedicated to your future. Take advantage of any opportunity to show that your criminal history is just that—history. You can use your personal essay (part of your application), in–person interview, letters of recommendation, and any other supporting documents to show the admissions committee that you are more than just your record.<sup><a href="#footnote-2597" id="footnote-ref-2597">[2597]</a></sup> Here are some other facts to keep in mind that work in your favor:</p><ol class="text">There are no educational opportunities that you are legally banned from because of your criminal record—no matter what is in it;California public community colleges, state colleges, and state universities do not ask prospective students about their criminal history (as a policy);<sup><a href="#footnote-2598" id="footnote-ref-2598">[2598]</a></sup>Educational institutions are not authorized under California law to request background checks on people,<sup><a href="#footnote-2599" id="footnote-ref-2599">[2599]</a></sup> (however, there is nothing to stop them from asking self-reporting questions on applications). Distance Education programs are not likely to ask about your criminal history because they do not have to worry about campus safety (Although there is no evidence that a student with a criminal history poses an increased safety risk,<sup><a href="#footnote-2600" id="footnote-ref-2600">[2600]</a></sup> this is the main reason schools care about your criminal history). Many schools will look at your criminal history only to flag you if you are applying to a program in a career field that you’re not allowed to work in anyway because of your criminal history (common in medical schools).<sup><a href="#footnote-2601" id="footnote-ref-2601">[2601]</a></sup> (For more information on licensing and employment restrictions, see EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, PG. 654.)Some colleges collect criminal history information, but never actually use it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2602" id="footnote-ref-2602">[2602]</a></sup> </ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153759"></a>Do I need to disclose my juvenile record when applying to different educational programs?</h3><p class="text">Maybe. Technically, a juvenile “adjudication” is not a criminal conviction. If your case was heard in a juvenile court, and you received a juvenile adjudication, then you were not “convicted” of a crime. So, if the application asks if you were “convicted of a crime” or if you have any “criminal convictions,” and you only have a juvenile adjudication, you can truthfully answer “no.” You do not have to disclose your juvenile adjudication.<sup><a href="#footnote-2603" id="footnote-ref-2603">[2603]</a></sup> However, some applications ask if you have ever been “arrested” or “adjudicated guilty,”<sup><a href="#footnote-2604" id="footnote-ref-2604">[2604]</a></sup> in which case, your juvenile arrest and adjudication count, and need to be reported. <em>Remember</em>, if you were tried as an adult, even if you were under 18, and you pleaded or were found guilty, then you do have a criminal conviction. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Even if you are not directly asked to disclose your juvenile record on an application, you may want to anyway.

Unfortunately, many people have struggled in school their whole lives, but do not realize that their difficulties stem from learning challenges that can be overcome. Many people with learning challenges are able to prosper in school if they get the proper guidance, support, and instruction. The most common learning challenges are: </p><ol class="text">Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—inability to control behavior or pay attention, often accompanied by hyperactivity.Dyslexia—difficulty reading, understanding, and processing written words.Dyscalculia—difficulty with number values, calculations, and math concepts.</ol><p class="text">There are many other types of learning challenges, including those related to writing, processing visual or sound information, memory, organization, and attention to detail.

For programs that are very popular, you may have to submit an application and be accepted to the program before you can enroll (admission is not automatic). To learn more about program requirements and enrollment policies, you can call the admissions office of the school you are interested in. This information is also usually available on the school’s website. Four-year colleges generally require you to submit an application for admission and be accepted to the school before you can enroll and register for classes. Applications often are available online (and can be submitted online), or you can call the school’s admissions office and ask them to send you an application by regular mail or email.

Associate degree programs are designed to take two years of full-time study to complete (but part-time students may take longer), and generally require students to take various general education courses like English, math, and science. An associate degree can be a stepping-stone toward earning a bachelor’s degree or can prepare you to enter the workforce directly.<sup><a href="#footnote-2717" id="footnote-ref-2717">[2717]</a></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153800"></a>What are some of the advantages of pursuing an Associate Degree?</h3><p class="text">An Associate Degree is a great option for many people because:</p><ol class="text">It can be earned in only 2 years;It costs less than a 4-year degree;It gets you into the workforce faster;The programs are more flexible, and can be scheduled around work or other obligations;It can be a low-cost stepping stone to a 4-year college or university, if you transfer credits (see PG. 974 for more information on transferring credits).</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153801"></a>What types of Associate Degrees are there?</h3><p class="text">There are two categories of associate degrees: </p><ol class="text">Associate of Arts (AA)/Associate of Science (AS)Associate of Applied Arts (AAA)/Associate of Applied Science (AAS). </ol><p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">AA and AS degree programs</span> tend to be designed for students who eventually want to earn a bachelor’s degree at a four-year college or university. Therefore, these programs focus more on preparing students for higher levels of academic study. The courses offered and credits earned in an AA or AS program are meant to be easily transferred to a four-year college. (See PG. 974 for information on transferring credits.)<span class="emphasisitalic">The “Applied” degrees (AAA and AAS)</span>, on the other hand, are more geared toward preparing students for a particular career. Therefore, these programs emphasize more technical and vocational skills.

They may also be a good choice if you intend to continue on to get your bachelor’s degree, but you want to save on costs. When you transfer your AA or AS credits to a four-year college, you can get up to half of the required credits for your bachelor’s degree at a fraction of the cost.<sup><a href="#footnote-2719" id="footnote-ref-2719">[2719]</a></sup>An AAA or AAS degree may be a good choice for you if you want to learn technical skills for a specific occupation, but you also want to have a college degree (not just a certificate).

It is a way for students to take a formal course of study (high school, vocational, or college-level) without having to travel to the classroom. Although the students and the teachers are separated, the hallmark of Distance Education is regular and substantial interaction between them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2750" id="footnote-ref-2750">[2750]</a></sup> Distance Education courses usually incorporate multiple forms of media, including printed materials, CDs or DVDs, audio recordings, telephone communication, audio or video conferencing, email, and Web-casts and Internet streaming. There are two types of Distance Education interaction modes: “synchronous” and “asynchronous” instruction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2751" id="footnote-ref-2751">[2751]</a></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153820"></a><span class="emphasisitalic"><strong>How do the two types of distance education work?</strong></span></h3><p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Synchronous instruction</span> means that all of the students and the instructor(s) participate in the class at the same time, even though they are not in the same place. This is usually done through “live” teleconferencing, video conferencing web conferencing, or Internet chats. The class is given at a set time, and everyone calls or logs in at that time to participate. Synchronous courses can offer a level of interactivity similar to that of a traditional face-to-face class.<sup><a href="#footnote-2752" id="footnote-ref-2752">[2752]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Asynchronous instruction</span> does not require that the student(s) and the instructor(s) participate at the same time. Students choose when they want to study the course materials or interact with the instructor(s). Asynchronous instruction is more flexible than synchronous instruction, but offers less interactivity because it is not “live.” In asynchronous instruction, course materials and communications are often delivered via CDs or DVDs, by traditional mail correspondence, or through e-mails, listservs and Internet downloads.<sup><a href="#footnote-2753" id="footnote-ref-2753">[2753]</a></sup></p><h3><a id="_Toc448153821"></a>Are there benefits to distance education? </h3><table><tr><td><div class="textstrongemphasis">PROS:</div></td><td><div class="textstrongemphasis">CONS:</div></td></tr><tr><td><ul class="textbox">Classes and programs are available to students who cannot attend in personSaves students time because they don’t have to travel to classesOften cheaper than location-based classesOften offers more flexible scheduling Less likely to be subject to class-size restrictions (i.e. classes available to more students)</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">Less interactivity and support than traditional classroom learningStudents must be self-motivated and self-directedMost programs require knowledge of and access to computers, Web browsers, email, and word-processing programs Some programs require continuous access to the InternetStudents miss out on benefits of classroom attendance, such as getting to know the instructor/ other students, and group discussions of views and opinions<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2754" id="footnote-ref-2754">[2754]</a></sup></sup></ul></td></tr></table><p class="textbox"><strong>BEWARE:</strong> Distance Education programs can vary in quality and legitimacy (quality of instruction can be low, credits/degrees may not be recognized by other schools or programs).

They are awarded for all kinds of reasons and can be based on almost any criteria. Often funders do not even advertise that they offer them. You may even find scholarships specifically targeted at helping currently and formerly incarcerated people pursue higher education!<sup><a href="#footnote-2794" id="footnote-ref-2794">[2794]</a></sup> </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153862"></a>Will my criminal history disqualify me from scholarships?</h3><p class="text">Not necessarily. Most scholarship applications do not ask for criminal history information. So, as long as you qualify for the scholarship otherwise, your criminal record should not be a factor in whether or not you can get it. If a scholarship application does ask for your criminal history, there’s usually no harm in applying anyway, and it won’t affect any other scholarships you apply for. </p><h2><a id="_Toc448153863"></a>Conclusion</h2><p class="text">Getting an education is probably the single-most important gift you can give yourself.

We have found that each student should understand the "concern" when using ones criminal history against them. Depending on the type of credentials one is trying to pursue, each entity will look at the relevance of the crime in lieu of the career/licensure, (e.g. if you were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, applying for pharmacy school or becoming a pharmacy technician may not be the route to take), however we have come across state entities that have utilized one's juvenile record and were attempting to reject state licensure based on moral turpitude for having a criminal history in general. In order to combat this each student must be proactive in developing a healthy source of documentation on the contrary in order to detract from the legal distractions that do not have any relevance to the path contemplated and are used solely for the purposes of discouraging students from applying for a specific cause. We have successfully assisted students in receiving such state licensure but it indeed can be a battle, which can be overcome.</p><h4>Schools That Accept the Board of Governors fee Waiver:</h4><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Coastline Community College</span> offers distance-learning courses leading to an associate’s degree.

In the second part of the Chapter, you will learn that you may be able to “clean up” your criminal record through different kinds of “expungement” in California. Expungement helps to protect your criminal history information and keep it out of sight for certain people. In most cases, “cleaning up” your criminal record WON’T completely erase it, but it CAN make past convictions and other criminal history less visible to many, which has many benefits in different areas of your life, including applying to housing, jobs, and more.</p><p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it.

Your “criminal record” includes arrests, charges filed against you, convictions, pleas, acquittals, dismissals, sentences, and any other contact you have had with law enforcement and/or the criminal justice system that was <em>documented</em> (written down). Here are some <em>examples</em> of how your contact with law enforcement or the criminal justice system can get documented. All of this information is considered part of your criminal record (but note that much of it may be PROTECTED from being seen): </p><ol class="text">You were pulled over while driving and arrested for a DUI; You received a citation for public disorderliness or having an open container in public; You were arrested, and the police wrote up an arrest record;You were taken to jail, booked into the system, and fingerprinted;You were charged with a crime;You were arraigned (appeared before a judge) in court and pleaded guilty or not guilty;You were convicted of a crime and sentenced to prison or jail, and the judge wrote a sentencing order;You were acquitted of the charges after a trial;You agreed to a plea bargain with the prosecutor. In exchange, the prosecutor dismissed some of the charges against you;You violated your probation or parole and had your supervision revoked;You had your conviction dismissed or expunged</ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS TO KNOW ABOUT: A lot of this information CANNOT be included in a regular background check.

It contains a list of every contact you have had with the criminal justice system, including: arrests, charges, convictions, acquittals, dismissals, pleas, sentences, and open warrants. Your RAP sheet includes important information like the date of each arrest, which law enforcement agency arrested you, what offense(s) you were charged with, your case number (docket or indictment number), and—most important—the final outcome (disposition) of each case (for example, acquittal, conviction, plea bargain, sentence, or dismissal).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2802" id="footnote-ref-2802">[2802]</a></sup></sup> It’s also important to look out for errors (learn about common errors in RAP sheets on PG. 1038).</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153872"></a>How many RAP sheets do I have?</h3><p class="text">If you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime in California, you potentially have three different RAP sheets.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2803" id="footnote-ref-2803">[2803]</a></sup></sup></p><ol class="text">Your county (local) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in that specific county <em>only</em>.

It’s important to <em>find and correct any errors </em>BEFORE the wrong information has a chance to harm you. <em>You will have an accurate record of your criminal history</em>, so that you know what information certain employers, professional licensing agencies, landlords, banks, or others might see about you.

To learn how to read and understand the information in your California RAP sheet, and to see a sample California RAP sheet, see APPENDIX AA, on PG. 1159. You can also ask a lawyer or a public defender to help you read and understand your RAP sheet.</p><p class="text">There are many different reasons why incorrect or incomplete information may show up in your government-produced RAP sheet. It’s very important to get copies of your RAP sheet (and background check, discussed on PG. 1044)—so that you can find and correct any errors BEFORE they cause problems for you!</p><h3><a id="Expung_FixingErrors_commonRAPsheeterrors"></a><a id="_Toc448153875"></a>What are common errors in RAP Sheets?</h3><ol class="text"><strong>Someone else’s information</strong>. Your RAP sheet may contain criminal history information about someone else with the same (or a similar) name as you.<strong>Leaving out important information about a case</strong>. Your RAP sheet may leave out important information about the final outcome of your case. For example, your RAP sheet may still say “case pending” even AFTER you were acquitted or the charges were dropped.<strong>Including sealed information</strong>. Your RAP may contain records that should have been destroyed or can only be released by special court order, such as sealed arrests or juvenile offenses.<strong>Misleading information</strong>. It is possible that a single charge may appear multiple times on your RAP, making it look like you have multiple offenses when you only have one.<strong>Misclassifying your offense</strong>. If a misdemeanor conviction shows up as a felony on your RAP sheet, this is a serious problem!</ol><h4 class="textbox">HOw could these mistakes end up in my rap sheet?</h4><ul class="textbox"><em>Human error.</em> The people who manage the various records can make mistakes. They may confuse you with someone who has a similar name, enter your information wrong, or include information that should NOT be included (for example, a sealed juvenile offense). <em>Failure to confirm information</em>: Although government agencies are supposed to confirm that the information that they have about you is correct and up-to-date, a lot of times they don’t. As a result, they may not report changes in the status of your case or the final outcome of the case, <em>even if you were acquitted or the case was dismissed!Identity theft.</em> Someone else may open an account using your personal information or commit a crime and pretend to be you by giving your name or identification.

If you find incorrect or missing information in your criminal records, you can follow these steps to fix the errors! Don’t let errors stay on your record — they can hurt your chances of getting a job, a place to live, or government benefits, and they can disrupt many other areas of your life as well! And don’t wait until the errors show up on a background check that is seen by an employer, private landlord, creditor, or government agency—it’s much easier to clean up errors BEFORE they cause you any problems!

You will need to contact the federal agency that sent your information to the FBI in order to correct it.Examples of FEDERAL agencies and courts include: the FBI; the U.S. Attorney’s Office (federal prosecutor); U.S. district courts; and U.S. Offices of Probation and Pretrial Services (federal probation department). </p><p class="text">Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your Identity History Summary) is the federal government’s official record of all of your interactions with law enforcement and the criminal justice system from anywhere in the United States, including any federal cases or convictions. The FBI gets your fingerprints and criminal history information from other criminal justice organizations throughout the U.S. This includes local police, county sheriff, and state highway patrol departments, statewide criminal justice agencies (such as the California Department of Justice), federal law enforcement agencies (such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI itself), and state and federal courts. In general, when you have any interaction with one of these agencies, they send your information to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division. The FBI can only change your information if the original agency or court (i.e., the one that sent the information to the FBI in the first place) tells the FBI to change it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2809" id="footnote-ref-2809">[2809]</a></sup> If you think your FBI RAP sheet is inaccurate or incomplete, there are 2 ways to correct the information: </p><div class="headingboldunderl11"><strong>OPTION 1: Contact the court or agency that sent your information to the FBI.</strong></div><p class="text">NOTE: Each entry on your FBI RAP sheet should list the specific agency that provided the information.

They are usually done by <em>private background check companies</em> which often get requests for them from employers and landlords. There are special laws that protect your rights when someone gets a background check on you. <em>Remember</em>, a background check does NOT include your RAP sheet or your credit report, and there are strict limits on what criminal history information they can include.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153880"></a>What is a background check? </h3><p class="text">You’ve probably heard of someone running a “background check” on someone else. A background check is the process of looking up non-confidential information about someone’s past activities, including their criminal history, work experience, education, debts, etc. When someone runs a background check on you, they may research your history by looking up public records about you, running an internet search on you, and even interviewing people you know! Most commonly, background checks are done by <em>private companies</em> that specialize in investigating people and compiling information about them. Employers, private landlords, creditors, and other people often hire these companies to run a background check on you when you apply for a job, rent an apartment, apply for a loan, or volunteer at your child’s school!

And what’s the difference between a RAP sheet and a credit report?</h3><p class="text">In California, a credit report is different from a background check and is covered by a different set of laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-2828" id="footnote-ref-2828">[2828]</a></sup> A credit report contains information about your money and finances—including debts you owe (such as unpaid bills, loans, or leases), your payment history for past bills and debts, and the status of your credit accounts. Your credit report does NOT include your criminal history or other personal information about you. For this reason, this legal guide does not go into detail about the laws governing credit reports.</p><h3><a id="_Toc448153892"></a>Will my credit report be included in my background check?</h3><p class="text">Generally, no. Background check companies are NOT allowed to include your credit report in your regular background check, because not everyone who is allowed to see your background check is also allowed to see your credit report. When companies run your credit report, they must follow a separate set of rules that are specific to credit reports, which are not covered in this guide. The only time that your credit report and background check will be together is when someone who is <em>ALLOWED to see both</em> requests them together (for example, a landlord can request both at the same time, but most employers cannot see your <em>credit</em> report, just your criminal background check).<sup><a href="#footnote-2829" id="footnote-ref-2829">[2829]</a></sup> <em>NOTE: This </em>Roadmap to Reentry<em> guide does NOT cover credit reports. </em>When this guide refers to background checks or background check reports, it means information about your <em>criminal history</em> (and certain other personal information)—but NOT your credit report.

In California, state and federal laws<sup><a href="#footnote-2835" id="footnote-ref-2835">[2835]</a></sup> allow background check companies to run background checks and send the information…</p><ol class="text">To anyone making decisions about you for: employment, renting a house/apartment, professional licensing, government benefits, credit obligations,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2836" id="footnote-ref-2836">[2836]</a></sup></sup> court-ordered child support or alimony, or insurance;To establish child support requirements; In response to a court order or subpoena;To anyone with a legitimate business need for the report (for example, a bank, creditor, or someone you have a business relationship with);<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2837" id="footnote-ref-2837">[2837]</a></sup></sup>orTo the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration.</ol><p class="text">Basically, the main people who can—and are likely to—run a background check on you are employers, private landlords, insurance companies, licensing boards and agencies, and financial institutions. </p><p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, there are LIMITS on what information can be included in your background check.

Because most criminal records and criminal case information is technically public, people in the general public could access on their own most legal paperwork filed in court or with a government agency. For example, anyone can go to the local courthouse, look up your criminal case and make copies of the documents in the court file. But it is very unlikely that most people would go down to the courthouse to look you up for an apartment or job! Keep in mind that the information is likely scattered across hundreds of locations, so someone would really have to know exactly what they are looking for to actually find it. That’s why most people use professional background check companies to do the investigating for them—and that’s why these companies and the background checks they create are regulated by state and federal laws to protect you! </p><a id="_Toc448153897"></a><a id="Expung_GettingCopiesCriminalRecords"></a><h2>GETTING COPIES OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS</h2><h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4><ul class="learn-bullets">Why it’s important to get a copy of your RAP sheet and background check;How to get your state, federal, and county RAP sheets;How to get a copy of your background check.</ul><p class="normal1"> </p><p class="text">This section explains how you can get copies of your various types of criminal records.

In some counties, you can get a complete RAP sheet that has ALL of your criminal history information from that county in one place, including all of your convictions, arrests, and any open warrants. In other counties, these records are kept separately (by different agencies), so you will need to go to several places and get separate records for all of your court cases (convictions), arrest records, and warrants.

An expungement is also called a “dismissal” because your case is actually reopened by the court, the “finding of guilt” (your guilty or no contest plea, or guilty verdict) is withdrawn, and a plea of <em>not guilty</em> is entered. The court will then dismiss your case, and your record will be changed to show a dismissal (under Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4) rather than a conviction. Getting your conviction expunged hides the conviction from certain people when they run a <em>background check</em> on you. For example, most private employers are NOT allowed to see a conviction that has been expunged.<sup><a href="#footnote-2845" id="footnote-ref-2845">[2845]</a></sup> Additionally, most private employers CANNOT ask you about, or even consider, a conviction that has been expunged when you apply for a job.<sup><a href="#footnote-2846" id="footnote-ref-2846">[2846]</a></sup> For information on how to get a conviction expunged, see PG. 1065.</p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Expungement does NOT erase the offense from your criminal record or RAP sheet.

This process is called filing a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, and is basically the same for both mandatory and discretionary expungements, with a few small differences. You will need to file the proper forms in the court where you were convicted, and you may have a hearing in front of a judge (especially if you are requesting a discretionary expungement). For a detailed explanation of each step, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120. </p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have convictions from multiple cases, you will need to file a separate petition for each <em>case</em>.</p><h3><a id="Expung_CAExp_HowAutomaticExpung"></a><a id="_Toc448153922"></a>If my conviction is eligible to be expunged automatically, how does this happen? </h3><p class="text">Under the law, certain drug convictions will be expunged from your record <em>automatically</em>, without you having to file a petition in court. This happens in the following 2 situations:</p><ol class="text"> Successful completion of a drug diversion program:<sup><a href="#footnote-2893" id="footnote-ref-2893">[2893]</a></sup> In some cases, if you were charged with a drug offense, the judge will <em>suspend your sentence</em> so that you can complete <em>drug treatment</em> instead of going to jail. If the judge suspended your sentence and ordered you to do a drug-treatment program (<em>drug diversion</em>), and you successfully completed the program, your records will be automatically expunged.<em>NOTE: This remedy is available ONLY if you were given drug diversion by the court AND you successfully completed all court-ordered requirements. If you did NOT complete your requirements, or you were NOT actually given diversion by the court, then the conviction will still be on your record (even if you completed a drug treatment program on your own).</em>Minor Marijuana Convictions:<sup><a href="#footnote-2894" id="footnote-ref-2894">[2894]</a></sup>If you have a minor marijuana conviction on your record, your record will be cleaned <em>automatically</em> if: Your conviction was for “<em>simple possession</em>” of marijuana; ANDThe conviction occurred <em>after January 1, 1976</em>; ANDThe conviction is <em>more than 2 years old</em>.After 2 years, all records relating to your arrest and conviction will be destroyed. You will be able to say that you have NO arrests or convictions for this case.<em>NOTE: This automatic erasure of minor marijuana convictions is ONLY for convictions related to possession of less than 1 ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana for personal use. If your conviction was for cultivation, sales, or transportation of marijuana, it will NOT be erased automatically.</em></ol><p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of January 1, 2011, simple possession of marijuana is no longer a misdemeanor offense; it is now only an infraction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2895" id="footnote-ref-2895">[2895]</a></sup> Although minor marijuana infractions are supposed to be erased automatically just like other minor marijuana (misdemeanor) convictions, in practice, this doesn’t always happen! If you find that your marijuana infraction has NOT been erased from your record, you will need to contact the court clerk at the court that handled your case and ask him or her to (1) correct your criminal record and (2) destroy all arrest and conviction records from your case. </p><h3><a id="Expung_Ques_EarlyReleaseProb_forExpung"></a><a id="_Toc448153923"></a>Because I am still on probation and need to be off to have my conviction expunged, is there anything I can do to get off early? </h3><p class="text">Yes. Under California law, you can ask the judge to release you early from your probation term (called “<em>early discharge</em>”).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2896" id="footnote-ref-2896">[2896]</a></sup></sup> Although courts often sentence people to several years on probation (for example, 3-4 years for a misdemeanor), many people are able to complete all of their probation requirements (all of the things the court has ordered them to do—such as attend counseling or pay restitution) long before their time is up. For this reason, courts are often willing to release people early from their probation. For more information about probation terms and conditions, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 130.You can request early release from probation whether you are on <em>informal</em> probation (also called <em>court probation</em>), <em>formal</em> probation, or <em>mandatory supervision</em>. The process is the same for all three.<sup><a href="#footnote-2897" id="footnote-ref-2897">[2897]</a> </sup>However. early release from supervision in order to get your conviction expunged ONLY applies if you are on informal or formal PROBATION or Mandatory Supervision. It does NOT apply if you are on parole or PRCS. Although you CAN get off parole and PRCS early, you still CANNOT get your conviction expunged because you will have served a prison sentence for it. For more information about the difference between formal and informal probation, PRCS, and parole, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 130.

Ideally, you should contact the lawyer who represented you when you were sentenced, but any private criminal defense lawyer or Public Defender should be able to help you. Requesting an early release from probation will involve filing a Motion for Early Termination of Probation. You will have a hearing where you will need to convince the judge that you deserve to be discharged from your probation term early.

You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by reading the California Penal Code section that is listed on your RAP sheet.

If you enter a business, during regular business hours and steal something worth less than $950, it is now shoplifting instead of second-degree burglary. If you are charged with shoplifting, now you cannot also be charged with petty theft or burglary. If you have a conviction for felony second-degree burglary (California Penal Code section 459), you may be able to get it reduced to misdemeanor shoplifting.<span class="emphasisitalic">Forgery (Penal Code sections 470, 471, 472, 475)</span>—Prop 47 changes the laws for several forgery offenses that previously could be charged as either misdemeanors or felonies. Now, all of these offenses are straight misdemeanors only. However, Prop 47 does NOT apply if you are convicted of both forgery and identity theft (Cal. Penal Code section 530.5). If you have a felony conviction for an eligible forgery offense, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Forgery/Writing Bad Checks (Penal Code section 476a)</span>—Prop 47 changes this offense from a “wobbler” to a straight misdemeanor if the amount of the check is less than $950. Beware, however, that Prop 47 does not apply if you have three or more prior forgery convictions. If you have a felony conviction for writing a bad check, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Theft (Penal Code section 490.2)</span>—Before Prop 47, an offense was classified as either GRAND THEFT (a felony) or PETTY THEFT (a misdemeanor) based on (1) the value of the property stolen, (2) the type of property stolen (i.e. guns or cars), OR (3) the manner in which the property was stolen (for example, from someone’s immediate possession). After Prop 47, the offense is classified based ONLY on whether the value of the property is more or less than $950. So, now if you steal something that is worth less than $950, you can only be charged with misdemeanor petty theft, regardless of what type of property you took or how you took it. If you have a felony grand theft conviction, you may be able to get it reduced to misdemeanor petty theft. <span class="emphasisitalic">Receiving Stolen Property (Penal Code Section 496)</span>—Prop 47 changes this offense to a straight misdemeanor if the value of the stolen property is under $950. If you have a felony conviction for receiving stolen property, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Petty Theft with a Prior (Penal Code Section 666)</span>—Before Prop 47, if you were charged with petty theft and had three or more previous theft convictions, you could have been charged with a felony. Now, for most people, you cannot be charged with a felony for petty theft, no matter how many prior petty theft convictions you have. The only way that you can be charged with <em>felony</em> petty theft under section 666 now is if you are already excluded from Prop 47 (see above for convictions that can exclude you), and you also have a previous conviction for petty theft, grand theft, elder financial abuse, joyriding, burglary, carjacking, robbery or felony receiving stolen property,<sup><a href="#footnote-2948" id="footnote-ref-2948">[2948]</a></sup> OR you are required to register as a sex offender. If you have a felony conviction for petty theft based on prior theft convictions, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Simple Drug Possession (Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 11350, 11357, &amp; 11377)</span>—Under Prop 47, simple possession of pretty much any controlled substance is a straight misdemeanor.<sup><a href="#footnote-2949" id="footnote-ref-2949">[2949]</a></sup> If you have a felony conviction for simple drug possession, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p><h3><a id="_Toc448153940"></a>How do I get my conviction reduced under Prop 47?</h3><p class="text">The process for getting a felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop 47 depends on whether you are currently still serving your sentence (“under sentence”) for the conviction, or if you have already completed your sentence. </p><ol class="text"><em>If you are currently still serving your sentence</em> (meaning you are <em>incarcerated</em> OR on<em> parole or PRCS</em> for the qualifying conviction—also called being “<em>under sentence</em>”),<sup><a href="#footnote-2950" id="footnote-ref-2950">[2950]</a></sup> you must ask to be “resentenced.” (See PG. 1076 for information on resentencing.)<em>If you have already</em> <em>completed your sentence</em>, you must ask to have your conviction “reclassified.” (See PG. 1076 for information on reclassification.)<em>If you are currently on formal probation</em> for the qualifying offense, the courts are still figuring out whether you must ask for resentencing or reclassification.

Then you will have a hearing where you will have to convince the judge that you are rehabilitated and ready to be a responsible member of society. NOTE: You must request a Certificate of Rehabilitation from the court in the county <em>where you currently live</em>. This is different from most other remedies (such as expungement, reducing your felony to a misdemeanor, and Prop 47), which require you to request them from the court <em>where you were convicted</em>.</p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You have the <em>right</em> to a lawyer to help you with your request for a COR.

A pardon can potentially restore all of the rights you lost due to your conviction—including your gun rights and your right to serve on a jury—as well as eliminate your requirement to register as a sex offender. It is the best thing you can do to reduce the impact of your criminal record on your life, but it is still not a complete remedy because it does not make it as if the conviction never happened. (For more information on what a pardon does and does NOT do for you, see PG. 1083.) A California Governor’s pardon is an honor traditionally granted only to individuals who have demonstrated exemplary behavior following conviction for a felony.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2980" id="footnote-ref-2980">[2980]</a></sup></sup> A pardon by the Governor is an official acknowledgement of your rehabilitation, by the state’s highest elected official. A Governor’s pardon provides significant relief from the collateral civil consequences of a criminal conviction. Both the California Penal Code and the California Constitution give the Governor the authority to grant a pardon, and that authority is entirely discretionary.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2981" id="footnote-ref-2981">[2981]</a></sup></sup> Unfortunately, Governor’s pardons are difficult to get and are NOT granted very often, so you should try to clean up your record using other remedies first—such as an expungement or a Certificate of Rehabilitation. </p><h4 class="textbox">Governor’s Pardons vs.<br /> Felony Reductions, Reclassifications &amp; Resentencing</h4><p class="textbox">In most cases, you are NOT eligible for a Governor’s pardon if you ONLY have misdemeanor convictions on your criminal record. (In other words, you must have a felony conviction to get a pardon.) If you reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor under California Penal Code section 17(b) (see PG. 1068), or have it reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop 47 (see PG. 1072), you could become ineligible for a Governor’s pardon (unless you also have other felony convictions on your record). HOWEVER, in most cases it’s still better to have your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor—even if that makes you ineligible for a Governor’s pardon—for these reasons:</p><ul class="textbox">It is MUCH easier to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor than it is to get a Governor’s pardon. Governor’s pardons are very rare, and you should not count on getting one.Getting your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor removes the felony from your criminal record and allows you to say that you were never convicted of a felony for that offense. But a Governor’s pardon does NOT remove, erase, or seal the conviction on your record, so you will still have to disclose that you have a felony conviction even if you have been pardoned.</ul><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If your conviction is eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, you should absolutely apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation <em>first</em>, BEFORE seeking a pardon.

You will have a hearing where the judge will review your petition and ask for a recommendation from the probation department. You will need to answer any questions the judge has, and you can bring people to testify on your behalf. The judge will then decide whether or not to grant your request. If the judge decides to seal you record, s/he will also order all other agencies that have juvenile records on you to seal their records as well. If the judge does not decide to seal your record, you are allowed to refile your petition (the judge will tell you when). For more information and instructions on how to seal your juvenile record, see APPENDIX Y, on PG. 1156.)For more information about sealing juvenile records in general, see Sealing Your Juvenile Records—a helpful guide from <em>Public Counsel</em>, available online at <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/publications/files/Sealing-your-Juvenile-Record.pdf">http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/publications/files/Sealing-your-Juvenile-Record.pdf</a>.</p><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: As of January 1, 2015, California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code section 786 changed so that juveniles who successfully complete probation, and otherwise qualify to have their record sealed, will have their juvenile record <em>automatically</em> sealed by the judge, <em>without</em> having to file a petition in court or do anything else.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3039" id="footnote-ref-3039">[3039]</a></sup></strong> However, this DOES NOT apply to juveniles who completed their probation BEFORE January 1, 2015.

Federal convictions can cause some people to become ineligible for government-assisted housing,<sup><a href="#footnote-3040" id="footnote-ref-3040">[3040]</a></sup> federal student loans,<sup><a href="#footnote-3041" id="footnote-ref-3041">[3041]</a></sup> and <em>prohibit</em> you from participating in foster care or adoption programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-3042" id="footnote-ref-3042">[3042]</a></sup> so getting them expunged can benefit you in reapplying to these programs.</p><h4 class="sidebox">Federal expungement &amp; dismissal:</h4><p class="sidebox">A <strong>federal expungement</strong> is different than an expungement under California law. Federal law allows for complete expungement of your conviction. The entire record of your conviction is completely erased along with any information associated with it. The offense is removed from your criminal record as if it never happened. This only applies in very limited situations, but it is a true expungement (see Situation 1). A <strong>federal dismissal</strong> is more like a California expungement, in that the conviction is NOT completely erased from your record, but it is still hidden from public view (see Situation 2).</p><p class="text">Unfortunately, most federal convictions <em>cannot be expunged or dismissed</em>. Unlike in California (and most other states), there is NO general federal law that offers expungements for federal convictions. However, there are a few federal laws that offer expungements<strong> </strong>and dismissals<strong> i</strong>n certain limited situations.There are only a few options for cleaning up federal convictions on your criminal record:</p><ol class="text">If your federal conviction is for certain drug offenses and you were <em>UNDER</em> 21 when you committed the offense, you may be eligible for a federal expungement.<em> (See Situation 1, below.)</em>If your federal conviction is for certain drug offenses and you were <em>OVER</em> 21 when you committed the offense, you may be eligible for a federal <em>dismissal</em>, but not an expungement.<em> (See Situation 2, below).</em>It is<em> possible</em> but <em>very difficult</em> to get your conviction expunged by a federal judge (this is called a <em>judicial expungement</em>). However, this is very rare, and depends on which federal court you were convicted in. <em>(See Situation 3, below).</em></ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153977"></a>Who can get a federal expungement or dismissal? </h3><p class="text">If you have a federal drug conviction (<em>Situation 1 or 2, below</em>), you may qualify for an expungement or dismissal of your conviction if ALL of the following are true:</p><ol class="text">You were convicted of only one drug-related offense. You are NOT eligible if you have <em>any</em> other drug-related convictions (state or federal), OR if you have had any previous drug convictions expunged under the statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-3043" id="footnote-ref-3043">[3043]</a></sup>You were in possession of only <em>certain</em> types of drugs. The federal expungement statute ONLY covers convictions for marijuana, cocaine and cocaine-based substances, heroine, and methamphetamines (along with a few other less common drugs). To be eligible, your conviction must have involved one of these drugs (NOT any other drug).<sup><a href="#footnote-3044" id="footnote-ref-3044">[3044]</a></sup> You were convicted of “simple possession” only. You are NOT eligible if your conviction was for <em>any other offense</em> besides possession of a small amount of drugs consistent with personal use. This means no sales, transportation, or distribution offenses will qualify.<sup><a href="#footnote-3045" id="footnote-ref-3045">[3045]</a></sup> The judge “suspended” entry of judgment of conviction for the offense. This means that you were found guilty of the offense, but the judge basically put your conviction <em>on hold</em>, and did not enter it into the official record. (This is to give you a chance to complete probation or a treatment program instead of going to prison.);The judge put you on probation for <em>no more than 1 year</em>; ANDYou successfully completed probation with NO violations.</ol><h3><a id="_Toc448153978"></a>I meet all of the requirements for federal expungement. What are my next steps for pursuing the expungement?</h3><h4>Situation 1: If you were under 21 at the time of the drug offense.</h4><p class="text">When your probation term ends, you can ask the judge to expunge your conviction. If you have successfully completed your probation with NO violations, and you meet all the other requirements, the judge is <em>required</em> to grant your expungement. This means that ALL <em>official records</em> of your conviction, all references to your <em>arrest</em>, and the results of any <em>criminal proceedings</em> against you will be destroyed. You will get back any rights that you lost because of your conviction, and you can say that you have never been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted of the offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-3046" id="footnote-ref-3046">[3046]</a></sup> </p><h4>Situation 2: If you were over 21 at the time of the drug offense. </h4><p class="text">If you were <em>over</em> the age of 21 at the time of your offense, your conviction will not be completely expunged (i.e. erased). However, if you <em>successfully complete your probation</em> with NO violations, and you meet all the other requirements described above, the judge is <em>required</em> to dismiss your conviction at the end of your probation term. You can also ask the judge to dismiss your conviction and release you from probation early (before the end of your probation), but it will be up to the judge whether or not to grant this early. Once your conviction is dismissed, the record will be sealed—meaning the record will still exist, but it will NOT be public, and it will NOT show on your criminal record that you were ever convicted of the offense. You will also get back any rights that you lost because of your conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3047" id="footnote-ref-3047">[3047]</a></sup></p><p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your conviction is expunged (Situation 1) or dismissed (Situation 2), the U.S. Department of Justice will keep a confidential, non-public record of your conviction in case you try to get another conviction expunged or dismissed in the future. Remember: You can only get a federal expungement <em>once in a lifetime!</em><sup><a href="#footnote-3048" id="footnote-ref-3048">[3048]</a></sup></p><h4><a id="Expung_Part9_FedJudicialExpungement"></a>Is there any other way to get my federal conviction expunged? (Situation 3)</h4><p class="text">Maybe. It is sometimes possible to convince a federal judge to ORDER that your conviction be expunged. This is called a “judicial expungement.” However, judicial expungements <em>are VERY, VERY rare—and some courts won’t do them at all.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-3049" id="footnote-ref-3049">[3049]</a></sup> Many federal courts only grant judicial expungements when it is <em>necessary</em> to correct an error in a criminal case that amounts to a violation of your basic rights (i.e. a “<em>miscarriage of justice</em>”). In these courts your only chance of being granted a judicial expungement is if your conviction was the result of illegal or invalid conduct by the government, such as an unlawful arrest, an unconstitutional law, or a gross administrative error.<sup><a href="#footnote-3050" id="footnote-ref-3050">[3050]</a></sup> </p><ol class="text">The federal courts in California follow this rule—so if your federal conviction happened in <em>California</em>, you will need to show that your conviction was caused by a “<em>miscarriage of justice</em>,” otherwise the judge will NOT grant you a judicial expungement.<sup><a href="#footnote-3051" id="footnote-ref-3051">[3051]</a></sup> </ol><p class="text">Other federal courts will grant a judicial expungement only under specific and extraordinary circumstances, when they determine that it is necessary in all fairness.<sup><a href="#footnote-3052" id="footnote-ref-3052">[3052]</a></sup> These courts balance the harm that you suffer because of your criminal record (for example, if you are denied public housing or benefits, you cannot be with your family, or you are disqualified from certain jobs), against the public’s interest in preserving the record of your conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3053" id="footnote-ref-3053">[3053]</a></sup> </p><ol class="text">If your federal conviction is from a state where the federal courts allow the judge to balance the factors of your situation, you will still have to convince the judge that the expungement is <em>necessary to preserve your basic rights</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-3054" id="footnote-ref-3054">[3054]</a></sup> </ol><h4>The Bottom Line:</h4><p class="text">The only circumstances under which you are likely to get a judicial expungement of your federal conviction are: </p><ol class="text">When your conviction is based on a law that was later found to be unconstitutional; <em>or </em>If a judge finds that your conviction was the result of police or government misconduct. </ol><h4 class="sidebox">Who gets Presidential Pardons?</h4><p class="sidebox">Here are some <em>examples</em> of people who have received a Presidential Pardon:</p><ul class="sidebox">Former President Richard NixonGeorge Steinbrenner (former owner of the New York Yankees)Roger Clinton, Jr. (half-brother of former President Bill Clinton)Marc Richard (billionaire businessman)Jimmy Hoffa (former union leader)Patty Hearst</ul><p class="text">If you want to request a judicial expungement of your federal conviction, it is recommended that you talk to a lawyer.

If you are denied by the DOJ, and have to file in court, this generally means you do not meet one of the requirements. If you file in court, you will have to convince a judge to order expungement of your DNA.

This process is called a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>. The process is almost the same for requesting mandatory or discretionary dismissal, but there are a few small differences. Remember, it is always good to ask a lawyer for assistance, especially if you are requesting discretionary dismissal.</p><h4 class="step">Get the court forms you will need to request an expungement from the court: the Petition for Dismissal (form CR-180) and the Order for Dismissal (form CR-181)</h4><h4 class="sidebox">The court clerk:</h4><p class="sidebox">The court clerk is the person who oversees all of the court’s records, legal documents, and administration. Some courts may have a separate clerk for each department of the court (e.g., criminal court, traffic court, probate court, etc.). If this is the case, you will need to get help from the <em>criminal</em> court clerk. Usually, the clerk will have a separate office, counter, or window at the courthouse. When you go to the courthouse, ask someone where the clerk’s office is if you can’t find it.</p><ol class="text">The “<em>Petition for Dismissal</em>” (form CR-180) is the formal document you use to ask the court to expunge your conviction. If the judge approves your expungement, s/he will sign the “<em>Order for Dismissal</em>” (form CR-181) to make your expungement an <em>official</em> court order.You can get these forms from several places, including. The Clerk of the court where you were convicted;The California Courts’ official website (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr180.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr180.pdf</a>); orFrom your lawyer. A sample form CR-180 and form CR-181 are included in APPENDIX DD, on PG. 1163 for reference. BUT it is always better to <em>get the most current version from an official source</em>, in case there have been any recent changes to the form.</ol><p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have convictions from multiple cases, you will need to file a separate petition for each <em>case</em>.</p><h4 class="step">Fill out your court forms (Petition AND Order)<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3113" id="footnote-ref-3113">[3113]</a></sup></sup></strong></h4><p class="text">Here are some tips for filling out the forms:</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Petition </span><em>—</em>Fill in ALL the information that the forms ask for. You will need the information from your RAP sheet (or court records from all of your cases) in order to fill out the forms.<span class="emphasisitalic">Petition question #1</span><em>—</em>If you are filing a petition to have a felony “wobbler” expunged, you will need to mark “Yes” in the box that asks if the felony is eligible for reduction to a misdemeanor under Penal Code Section 17(b). (See PG. 1071 for more information about expungement of felony “wobblers.”) <span class="emphasisitalic">Bottom of Petition</span> —If your sentence included probation, check the box for “1203.4.” If your sentence did NOT include probation, check the box for “1203.4a.” If you were convicted of a felony under California’s Realignment Act, check the box for “1203.41.” (See PG. 1060 for more information about expungement of felonies that were sentenced under Realignment.) <span class="emphasisitalic">Bottom of Petition</span>—Don’t forget to sign the form and put the date!<span class="emphasisitalic">Order</span><em>—</em>Only fill out the top boxes (for “<em>Lawyer or Party Without Lawyer</em>,” “<em>People of the State of California v. Defendant</em>,” and “<em>Case Number</em>”), and leave the rest of the form blank (all of the numbered questions). Make sure the information is the same as the top boxes on the <em>Petition</em> form! The judge will fill in all the other information after deciding whether or not to grant your expungement.<span class="emphasisitalic">Petition AND Order</span><em>—</em>If you are filling out the forms for yourself, you are BOTH the “<em>petitioner” </em>AND the “<em>defendant</em>,” so you should fill in your information wherever you see these terms. If your conviction qualifies for <em>mandatory</em> dismissal, you only need to fill out the Petition (CR-180) and Order (CR-181) forms. However, if your conviction only qualifies for <em>discretionary</em> dismissal, you will need to include a few more documents <em>in addition</em> to your petition. (See PG. 1061 for more information on the difference between mandatory and discretionary expungement, and to figure out which type of expungement you qualify for.) </ol><p class="text">FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPUNGEMENT, GO TO STEP 3. FOR MANDATORY EXPUNGEMENT, SKIP TO STEP 4.</p><h4 class="step"> (FOR DISCRETIONARY PETITIONS ONLY) Gather additional supporting documents to include with your Petition. </h4><p class="text">If you are requesting a discretionary dismissal, you will also need to include the following documents. (<em>Note</em>: Make a photocopy of any documents you send with your petition, and keep the original for yourself!)</p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">A Declaration</span>. A declaration is a statement that you write under penalty of perjury, that explains why expungement of your conviction is “<em>in the interests of justice</em>.” Your declaration should say why you deserve to get an expungement, and how it will help you succeed in the future:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3114" id="footnote-ref-3114">[3114]</a></sup></sup>How have you changed since your conviction? What was going on in your life at the time of the conviction? What has changed in your life since then?What efforts have you made toward rehabilitation? What are you doing to improve yourself and your situation (such as treatment programs, work or school, connecting with family, finding religion)?What are your goals for the future (for example, getting a job or promotion, getting your GED or a college degree, connecting with family, starting a business)?How will getting an expungement help you to achieve your goals?You can use the official Declaration form (MC-031) published by the Judicial Council of California which is available from the court clerk, or on the California Courts website at: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc031.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc031.pdf</a>. For tips for what to write in your Declaration, see APPENDIX L, on PG. 1124. For a <em>sample Declaration</em>, see APPENDIX M, on PG. 1125.<span class="emphasisitalic">Letters of Support</span>. Letters of support serve as character references and emphasize the positive impact that granting your dismissal will have. You should ask for letters from people who know you well, and who can talk about your positive qualities, your accomplishments, and your rehabilitation efforts. These can be from your rabbi, priest, or pastor; your employer (current or previous); your teachers; your sponsor or mentor; your counselor or case manager; community leaders and other members of community organizations that you are involved in; and your friends, family, and neighbors. When you ask someone for a letter of support, you can remind them of your accomplishments and explain what you would like them to write about (for example, how you have changed since your conviction, your efforts at rehabilitation, your good character, your efforts to improve yourself and help others around you, and why you deserve to have your conviction expunged). For more information on how to write a Letter of Support and tips for what to write, see APPENDIX N, on PG. 1126. A <em>sample Letter of Support </em>is included in APPENDIX O, on PG. 1128.<span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Accomplishments</span>. If you have completed any classes or training programs since your conviction (such as vocational training or job readiness programs; GED classes, or other schooling; mentorship courses, reentry programs, restorative justice workshops, or any other treatment programs), or if you have earned any certificates, awards, or degrees, or if there are any other accomplishments that you’re proud of, you should make sure to include this information with your petition! This can be anything you accomplished <em>while you were incarcerated</em> or <em>since you’ve been released</em>. (<em>Note</em>: Make a photocopy of any documents you send with your petition, and keep the originals for yourself!) <span class="emphasisitalic">Letter to Request a Hearing</span>. If you are asking for a discretionary expungement, you should ALWAYS ask for a <em>hearing</em> in front of a judge, so that you have the best chance to convince him/her to grant your request. To ask for a hearing, write a very brief letter saying that you would like to request a hearing on your Petition for Dismissal. Make sure to include your name and case number, and address your letter to “The Honorable Judge” (with the judge’s name, if you know it). Turn in this letter with your <em>Petition</em> and other documents.<span class="emphasisitalic">Other Documents</span>:<em> </em>Each court may have local rules about what additional documents you can include with your petition and what documents you should bring to the hearing. Check with the court clerk about what to do with any other documents that you would like the judge to consider.</ol><h4 class="step">Make copies of your petition and supporting documents.</h4><p class="text">After you have filled out your petition and attached your supporting documents, you will need to make several copies of everything. Ask the court clerk how many copies are required by the court in your county. If you can’t talk to the clerk, make at least five copies to be safe. Generally, the original petition goes in the court’s file (the “docket”), one copy goes to the District Attorney, one copy goes to the probation department, and one “courtesy” copy is saved for the judge (if he or she wants one). But these procedures may vary by county, so it’s important to ask the clerk how many copies you need to make.</p><h4 class="step"> “Serve” the Court Papers</h4><p class="normal1"><strong><em>What is “service” and how do I do it?</em></strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3115" id="footnote-ref-3115">[3115]</a></sup></sup></p><p class="text">Service is the formal process of giving copies of the documents in a court case to the other people connected with the case. It is a very important step because it lets the other people know 1) that your court case exists, and 2) what actions have been taken in the case so far. A case CANNOT go forward until the court documents are properly served (delivered). The most common methods of service are in person or by mail, although in come situations, service can be by fax or email also.In general, for an expungement petition, your papers have to be served on the <em>District Attorney</em> and the <em>county probation department</em>. Ask the court clerk whether there is <em>anyone else </em>who needs to get the papers also.</p><h4 class="step">File Your Petition and “Proof of Service” with the Court Clerk.</h4><ol class="text">After your papers have been “served” on all of the other parties, bring the following documents to the court clerk: Your<em> original</em> <em>Petition</em>; your additional supporting documents (if you are requesting a discretionary dismissal); one set of copies for your records; AND the Proof of Service for your Petition. The clerk will stamp your papers with the date and give you a stamped copy. Remember, the court clerk will usually have an office or counter at the courthouse, so that’s where you will need to go to file your papers.The clerk may or may not give you a court date for a hearing before a judge. FOR MANDATORY EXPUNGEMENTS: In some counties, mandatory expungements are granted without any hearing on your Petition. Other counties require a formal hearing before an expungement is granted. FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPUNGEMENTS: If you are requesting a discretionary expungement, you should ALWAYS ask for a <em>hearing</em> before a judge, so that you have the best chance to convince him/her to grant your expungement. Tell the court clerk that you would like to request a hearing and show him/her your letter requesting a hearing, which you should include with your other documents. </ol><h4 class="step">Go to Your Court Date/Hearing </h4><ol class="text">If you are given a hearing date to have your petition heard by a judge, you or your lawyer MUST go to court for the hearing. FOR MANDATORY EXPUNGEMENTS: If you qualify for a mandatory expungement, the judge will grant your petition, and dismiss your case. You should not have to do anything if there is a hearing. You should receive something in the mail from the court within a few weeks confirming that your record has been officially changed. FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPUNGEMENTS: If you are requesting a discretionary dismissal, the hearing is your chance to explain your case to the judge and persuade him or her that dismissing your conviction is “in the interests of justice.” You will need to show the judge why you deserve to have your conviction expunged, and how an expungement will help you succeed and achieve your goals.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3116" id="footnote-ref-3116">[3116]</a></sup></sup> You should be prepared to explain the information in your Declaration and in any supporting documents that you included with your Petition. Make sure you bring extra copies of these documents to the hearing! In general, the judge will tell you <em>right there at the hearing</em> whether or not your expungement is granted.</ol><h4 class="step">Follow up!</h4><ol class="text">After the judge grants your expungement and signs the Order making it official, the court will send the information to the Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies. It may take a few months for these agencies to correct your official criminal record (RAP sheet) to show that your conviction was expunged. You should follow up with the Department of Justice in 3-4 months to confirm that the changes were made. Remember, expungement does NOT erase the conviction from your criminal record. Instead, your RAP sheet will state that your case has been “<em>dismissed [in] furtherance of justice (DISM, FURTH OF JUST)</em>” OR “<em>dismissed pursuant to PC 1203.4</em>.”If the DOJ has NOT corrected your record after several months, you may need to ask them to do so by filing a “Claim of Alleged Inaccuracy or Incompleteness” (form BCIA 8706). The process for challenging and correcting information in your RAP sheet is detailed in APPENDIX F, on PG. 1112. </ol><h4 class="step">If your petition is denied, re-file it</h4><p class="text">If your petition for expungement is denied, you are allowed to file it again (“re-file”). At the end of your hearing, ask the judge to explain the reason why s/he did not grant your request for an expungement, so that you can take steps to fix the problem before you re-file your Petition. If you forget to ask or cannot get this information from the judge for some reason, try calling the court clerk to see if he or she can help you figure out what to do to make sure your Petition is granted the next time.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3117" id="footnote-ref-3117">[3117]</a></sup></sup> </p><div class="appendix"><a id="EX_App_L_TipsWritingDeclaration"></a>APPENDIX L</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppL"></a>Tips for Writing a Declaration</div><p class="text">The declaration is your chance to present evidence to convince the judge that you deserve an expungement. Here are some tips for writing your declaration:<sup><a href="#footnote-3118" id="footnote-ref-3118">[3118]</a></sup></p><ol class="text">First, explain the basic information about your conviction and sentence. Tell the judge why your conviction meets the requirements for discretionary expungement (see PG. 1062 for a list of requirements).Next, explain why granting your expungement would be “in the interest of justice”—meaning why you deserve to have your conviction expunged, and how the expungement will help you succeed in the future. Here are some examples of things you may want to talk about (but only if they are true for your situation!):If there were circumstances that made your life especially difficult at time of your conviction;How you are turning your life around;Your work and/or school history (including any vocational training, GED or other classes, and other programs you’ve participated in);Current opportunities for work, school, and other activities to enrich your life, and how expungement will help you take advantage of these opportunities;Your family situation and needs, and how an expungement will help you reconnect with, support, or otherwise benefit your family; andAny problems you have had completing probation, and what you are doing to address those problems. You should be specific and honest, and include as many details as possible to give the judge a concrete picture of what happened. But you should not include irrelevant or unnecessary information that might distract him/her. Finally, it is recommended that you ask a lawyer to look over your declaration before you turn it in, if possible.</ol><div class="appendix"><a id="EX_App_M_SampleDeclaration"></a>APPENDIX M</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppM"></a>Sample Declaration</div><p>SAMPLE DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF 1203.4 PETITION</p><p>NAME</p><p>ADDRESS</p><p>SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA</p><p>COUNTY OF _______</p><p>PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, 	Case No.:</p><p>Plaintiff 					DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF</p><p>VS.

Some ways you can make it easier for the people you are asking to help you are:<span class="emphasisitalic">Give them plenty of time.</span> Don’t ask them 2 days before you need to turn in the letter. Give them plenty of time to work on it so they don’t feel rushed and can put thought into what they’re writing. <span class="emphasisitalic">Give them plenty of information</span>. Make sure to remind them of things they can write about, such as your accomplishments or your positive impact on them.<span class="emphasisitalic">Give them friendly reminders</span>. If someone hasn’t responded to you or hasn’t given you a letter by the date you asked to have it done by, try writing them a quick email or calling them. Be polite and not demanding. Your message should be along the lines of “I know you are busy, but I was curious if you will have any time to work on that letter of support I asked you about?” <span class="emphasisitalic">Have a variety of people write letters for you</span>. You should have letters from people who know as many different aspects of you as possible. Don’t get all of your letters from people who all know you from the same activity or area of your life. <span class="emphasisitalic">Keep it Short</span>. It is best to keep the letters short, about 1–2 pages. This will make them easier to read and also less time consuming to write. </ol><div class="appendix"><a id="EX_App_O_SampleLetterSupport"></a>APPENDIX O</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppO"></a>Sample Letter of Support</div><p class="text">DateTo Whom It May Concern:Name has been a wonderful position or volunteer with name of organization or company since date.

Because this process requires drafting a formal court pleading with accompanying documents, it is recommended that you ask a lawyer for help. Ideally, you should contact the lawyer who represented you when you were sentenced, but any private criminal defense lawyer or Public Defender should be able to help you.</p><h4 class="sidebox">Need help with your court forms? </h4><p class="sidebox">Remember, it is recommended that you ask a lawyer to help you with your <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em>. But if you cannot get a lawyer or want to do it on your own, you can find helpful information on the California Courts website:</p><ul class="sidebox">Cleaning up your record <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1070.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1070.htm</a>Understanding the basics of court forms <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1078.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1078.htm</a>.</ul><p class="text">The process for filing a <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em> is as follows:</p><h4 class="step">Write your Motion and Supporting Documents.</h4><p class="text">There is no official court form for this motion, so you or your lawyer will have to write your own motion. Your motion will consist of these 5 parts:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3119" id="footnote-ref-3119">[3119]</a></sup></sup></p><ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Notice of Motion</span>—This tells the judge what you want to him or her to do. In other words, it tells the judge that you want to be released early from probation.<span class="emphasisitalic">Memorandum of Points and Authorities</span>—This section explains the law (California Penal Code section 1203.3(a)), the facts about your individual situation, and the evidence you have to justify your request for early release.<span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration</span>—This is your sworn statement that all the facts about your individual situation are true. Your <em>Declaration</em> must include ALL<em> </em>of the facts that you use to make your points in your <em>Memorandum</em> and all the information that you want to tell the judge to convince him or her to grant your request.<span class="emphasisitalic">Proposed Order</span>—This is the document the judge signs if s/he grants your early discharge and terminates your probation.<span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service</span>—You will need to give copies of your court papers to the other people involved in your case (generally the District Attorney and the probation department—ask the court clerk if there is anyone else). The Proof of Service proves that you gave copies to everyone who was supposed to get them.</ol><h4 class="sidebox">Court fees:</h4><p class="sidebox">Be aware that the clerk will charge you fees for filing documents with the court. The amount of the fees will vary by county. If you cannot afford to pay the fees, you can request a <em>fee waiver</em> (meaning you do not have to pay the fees). Ask the clerk how much the fees are and how to request a fee waiver. </p><h4 class="step">Make Copies &amp; File your Motion</h4><ol class="text">Once your motion and other papers are all ready, make copies for everyone who will receive it. Check with the court clerk to see how many copies you will need. Generally, you will need one copy for the DA, one for the Probation Department, and one for your own records, but you should ask the clerk if there is anyone else. You may also want to make a courtesy copy for the judge. Bring the original motion and all copies to file with the clerk in the court where you were convicted. The clerk will file your Motion, keep the original copy for the court file, and give you back the copies you need for yourself and the other parties (DA, probation department, etc.). After you file your motion, the clerk will give you a court date for a hearing before a judge. Ask the clerk what room your hearing will be in. </ol><h4 class="step">Serve your court papers on the other parties</h4><ol class="text">Service is the official process of giving copies of your court documents to other people connected with the case.Ask the court clerk whether you are responsible for serving your court papers, or whether the clerk will do it directly. If the clerk gives you back more than 1 copy when you file your court papers (see Step 3), this most likely means that you are responsible for service!If the clerk says that you are responsible for service, this means that you must make sure that all necessary parties (DA, probation department, and anyone else the clerk tells you) get a copy of your papers motion in the proper manner. If you are responsible for service, make sure to have your papers served on (delivered to) the DA <em>at least 2 days before</em> the court date for your hearing! The law requires you to give the DA at least 2 days notice of your Motion so he or she can prepare for the hearing as well.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3120" id="footnote-ref-3120">[3120]</a></sup></sup> </ol><h4 class="step">Attend The Hearing</h4><ol class="text">When you file your <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em>, the clerk will give you a court date for your motion to be heard by a judge. You MUST go to court for the hearing on that date and time! At the hearing, you will explain to the judge all the reasons why releasing you from probation early is “in the interests of justice”—in other words, why you deserve to be released early from probation, and why being off probation will help you to achieve your goals and avoid further hardships. You should talk about all of the factors discussed above, including (1) your successful fulfillment of your probation requirements and satisfaction of all conditions; (2) your good conduct, efforts at rehabilitation, and other accomplishments (work, school, volunteer efforts, family responsibilities, etc.); (3) what you have learned and how you have changed since your offense; and (4) why staying on probation will cause you hardship (for example, preventing you from finding work, attending school, traveling to see your family, etc.).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3121" id="footnote-ref-3121">[3121]</a></sup></sup> If the judge grants you early release from probation or changes your probation in any other way, he or she must explain the reasons for doing so. Also, before the judge signs the Order to officially end your probation, s/he must first notify your probation officer.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3122" id="footnote-ref-3122">[3122]</a></sup></sup> </ol><h4 class="step">Re-filing Your Motion</h4><ol class="text">Remember, a decision to terminate your probation early is entirely up to the judge to decide. However, if the judge denies your motion, you can re-file it. Make sure you find out why the judge denied your request so that you can fix the problem before you re-file. If there is something the judge wants you to <em>include</em> with your motion next time, make sure you include it. If there is something the judge wants you to <em>do</em> before he or she is willing to grant your request, make sure you do it! Finally, although there is no limit to how often or how many times you can re-file, do not be a nuisance! The last thing you want to do it put the decision in the hands of an annoyed judge!</ol><div class="appendix"><a id="EX_App_Q_SampleMotion_EarlyTerminatProb"></a>appendix Q</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppQ"></a><strong><img src="162.x-emf" /></strong>Sample Motion for Early Termination of Probation</div><p><strong><img src="163.x-emf" /></strong></p><p><strong><img src="164.x-emf" /></strong></p><p><strong><img src="165.x-emf" /></strong></p><p><strong><img src="166.x-emf" /></strong></p><p><strong><img src="167.x-emf" /></strong></p><p><strong><img src="168.x-emf" /></strong></p><div class="appendix"><a id="EX_App_R_ReduceFelonyToMisdemeanor"></a>APPENDIX R</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppR"></a>How to Reduce Your Felony Conviction to a Misdemeanor</div><p class="normal1"><a id="Expung_Part3_ReducFelConvic_partExpunge"></a><strong>As Part of Your Expungement Petition:</strong></p><p class="text">If you want to reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor AND get your conviction expunged, it is very easy to do both at the same time When you have your court hearing for your expungement, the judge will consider both requests—first your request to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, and then your request to have it expunged. If you meet all the requirements, usually the judge will grant both of your requests together. (For a list of the requirements for reducing a felony to a misdemeanor, see PG. 1068. For expungement requirements, see PG. 1058.)There are two main steps to this process: </p><ol class="text">File Your Petition for Dismissal: The<em> Petition for Dismissal </em>(form CR-180) that you must file to get your conviction expunged has a box to check if your conviction is also eligible to be reduced. When you are filling out your <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, mark the box on question # 1 to show that the conviction is eligible for reduction under California Penal Code section 17(b). (For more information on getting and filling out form CR-180, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120.)File the petition in the county where you were convicted. The same petition now serves as both your request to have your conviction expunged AND your request to have it reduced to a misdemeanor. (For details on how to file a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120.)Go to Your Court Hearing: When you have your court hearing, the judge will usually consider both requests at the same hearing—first your request to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, and then your request to have it expunged. At the hearing, the judge will consider the following: The nature of the offense;The facts of the case;Whether you fulfilled the conditions of your probation;Your full criminal record and personal conduct record;Any objections from the district attorney.</ol><p class="text">Again, usually the judge will make a decision on both of your requests together. </p><p class="normal1"><strong>As a Separate Petition:</strong></p><p class="text">If the judge does NOT reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or if your felony is eligible for reduction but not expungement, you may need to file a separate petition to get it reduced. Your petition will need to show the judge that your felony conviction meets all the requirements to be reduced to a misdemeanor (see PG. 1068 for a list of these requirements), and explain why you deserve to have your conviction reduced. It will be entirely up to the judge to decide whether your conviction should be reduced.

Most courts have created a single form that covers both resentencing and reclassification.</p><p class="text">If you are <strong>currently serving your sentence (“under sentence”)</strong> for an offense that qualifies under Prop 47, and you are NOT excluded by one of the disqualifying convictions, you may be eligible for RESENTENCING.<sup><a href="#footnote-3124" id="footnote-ref-3124">[3124]</a></sup> </p><h4 class="step">Obtain and fill out a Prop 47 petition</h4><p class="text">You will need to get the court forms from the clerk at the court where you were convicted. These forms are straightforward and simple to fill out—you just need to fill in information about your conviction (date of conviction, penal code section, and sentence), and check the box indicating that you are currently “under sentence” and requesting to be <em>resentenced</em>. (Sample petitions from SF, LA, and Sacramento Counties are included in APPENDIX EE, on PG. 1167.)</p><h4 class="step">File your Petition and Serve your Court Papers</h4><p class="text">You will need to file your petition with the court clerk of the court where you were convicted, and then serve (deliver) copies of your court papers on the District Attorney and any other people who are part of the case. (Ask the court clerk who you need to serve with your court papers). </p><h4 class="step">The Judge Reviews Your Petition to See if You are Eligible</h4><p class="text">After you file your petition, a judge will review it to make sure you are eligible (qualify) for resentencing.<sup><a href="#footnote-3125" id="footnote-ref-3125">[3125]</a></sup> Remember, in order to qualify for resentencing, you must meet all of the following requirements:</p><ol class="text">Your conviction must be for one of the qualifying convictions under Prop 47 (see PG. 1072); ANDYou must NOT have any of the disqualifying convictions (see PG. 1073);<sup><a href="#footnote-3126" id="footnote-ref-3126">[3126]</a></sup> ANDYou are currently “under sentence” for the qualifying conviction (incarcerated OR on parole or PRCS).</ol><h4 class="step">Qualification Hearing—if Requested</h4><ol class="text">When you petition for resentencing under Prop 47, you do not automatically get a hearing in front of a judge, but you may request one. If your conviction was for <em>shoplifting, theft, receiving stolen property, or forgery/bad checks</em>, you may want to request a hearing so you can prove to the judge that the value of property involved in your crime was <em>under $950</em>—and therefore qualifies under Prop 47.The DA can also request a hearing to contest (challenge) your petition. If there is a hearing on your petition, you should attend if you can. Whether or not you are able to attend, make sure that the judge has as much evidence as you can find to support your request for resentencing, including evidence of rehabilitation, proof of your accomplishments since your conviction, and letters of support. (See APPENDIX N, on PG. 1126 for tips on how to write a letter of support. See APPENDIX O, on PG. 1128 for a sample Letter of Support.) If you meet all of the requirements for resentencing, you are entitled to be resentenced UNLESS the judge decides that you pose an “<em>unreasonable risk to public safety.</em>” This means that the judge specifically thinks that if you are released, you will commit one of the<em> violent “super strike” felonies</em> listed in California Penal Code section 667(e)(2)c(iv)).<sup><a href="#footnote-3127" id="footnote-ref-3127">[3127]</a></sup> In making this decision, the judge will consider:your complete conviction history including:<sup><a href="#footnote-3128" id="footnote-ref-3128">[3128]</a></sup>the type of crime(s) you committed in the past;the amount of injury to your victim(s);the length of time you spent in prison in the past; ANDhow long ago you committed the crime(s).your disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while you were in prison;anything else the judge thinks is relevant.You should provide as much evidence as possible that you do not pose any risk to society. </ol><h4 class="step">Resentencing</h4><p class="text">If your conviction is eligible, your criminal history does not disqualify you, and the judge does not think you pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, you are entitled to be resentenced to a misdemeanor sentence. This means that your felony sentence will be reduced to a misdemeanor sentence instead! You will get credit for the time you’ve already served, so if you have already served the equivalent of a misdemeanor sentence, you can be released from custody right away.<sup><a href="#footnote-3129" id="footnote-ref-3129">[3129]</a></sup> </p><ol class="text">If you were still in prison at the time of resentencing, the judge will likely put you on parole for one year. However, depending on the facts of your situation, you may be able to convince the judge not to give you parole at all.<sup><a href="#footnote-3130" id="footnote-ref-3130">[3130]</a></sup> If you were on parole or PRCS at the time of resentencing, you could be discharged right away (if you have already completed the equivalent of a misdemeanor sentence), or the judge may reduce your supervision to probation.</ol><div class="headingbold14">RECLASSIFICATION under prop 47:</div><p class="text">If you already completed your sentence (including any parole or probation term) for an offense that qualifies under Prop 47, and you are NOT excluded by one of the disqualifying convictions, you may be eligible to have your felony RECLASSIFIED as a misdemeanor. Unfortunately, you cannot get back the time that you served for the felony, but you can change your criminal record to show a misdemeanor conviction instead of a felony conviction. </p><h4 class="step">Obtain and fill out your Petition for Reclassification</h4><p class="text">Just as for resentencing, you will need to fill out and file a petition for reclassification. Most courts use a single form for resentencing and reclassification, which you should get from the clerk at the court where you were convicted. When you fill out the form, you will need to fill in basic information about your conviction (such as the date of conviction, penal code section, and your sentence), and then check the box indicating that you are requesting reclassification.</p><h4 class="step">File your petition and Serve your court papers</h4><p class="text">File your petition with the clerk of the court where you were convicted, and then serve (deliver) copies of your court papers on the District Attorney and any other people who are part of the case.

To figure out your period of rehabilitation, you add the base term of 5 years plus an additional amount of time based on your conviction offense:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3133" id="footnote-ref-3133">[3133]</a></sup></sup></p><ol class="text"><em>Base 5 years</em> + 2 years = 7 years if your conviction was for: California Penal Code sections 311.2(b), (c), or (d), 311.3, 311.10, or 314; Any offense not listed here that does <em>NOT</em> carry a life sentence.<em>Base 5</em> years + 4 years = 9 years if your conviction was for:California Penal Code sections 187, 209, 219, 4500, or 18755;Military &amp; Veterans Code section 1672(a); <em>or</em> Any other offense that carries a life sentence; <em>Base 5</em> + 5 years = 10 years if your conviction was for: Any offense that requires you to register as a Sex Offender under California Penal Code section 290 (including any conviction for an attempted offense);<sup> </sup>Exception: If your conviction was for sections 311.2(b), (c), or (d), 311.3, 311.10, 314, you only need to wait 7 years (see above). </ol><p class="text">In addition to the above requirements, you must have completed any term of probation or parole that was part of your sentence or was a condition of your release. HOWEVER, the time you spend on probation or parole counts toward your total “period of rehabilitation.”<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you served <em>consecutive</em> prison terms, the judge may think that you should wait for a longer period of rehabilitation. If this happens, the judge will deny your COR the first time you apply, and will tell you how much additional time you must wait before you can re-apply.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3134" id="footnote-ref-3134">[3134]</a></sup></sup> <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is possible to apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation before the end of your period of rehabilitation. You must convince the judge that granting your Certificate of Rehabilitation early serves the “interests of justice.”<sup><a href="#footnote-3135" id="footnote-ref-3135">[3135]</a></sup> In other words, you’d better have a really good reason why you should get a COR early. The judge may consider your good conduct, rehabilitation efforts, and how important getting a COR is to your success in the future.

If you have had any new convictions or violations while on supervision, make sure you explain them—why the conviction happened, what you are doing differently now, and why you will not have the same problems again in the future.If you are currently required to register as a sex offender for your conviction, you must also convince the judge that you do not pose any threat of committing any sex offenses against children.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3137" id="footnote-ref-3137">[3137]</a></sup></sup>You should include as many letters of support and proof of your accomplishments as possible. (See APPENDIX N, on PG. 1126 for tips on getting letters of support).</ol><h4 class="step">File Your Petition with the Court clerk</h4><ol class="text">Once you have filled out your court forms, make at least 5 copies and take everything to the court clerk to be filed. Remember, you will need to file your forms with the criminal court in the county <em>where you currently live</em>.When you file your forms, the clerk will stamp them, give you back the copies, and give you a court date for your hearing. Make sure the date is at least 30 days away. </ol><h4 class="step">Serve your Papers on the other parties</h4><ol class="text">You will need to serve your court papers on all of the following people:The District Attorney in the county where you live;The District Attorney(s) in every county(s) where you were convicted (if you have convictions in counties other than the one you live in now);The Governor’s Office. You can serve your papers in person or by mail.You must make sure that all of your papers are served on everyone at least 30 days before your hearing (or 35 days if you are sending them by mail). If you do not serve your papers in time, your petition will be dismissed.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3138" id="footnote-ref-3138">[3138]</a></sup></sup> After you have served all your court papers, fill out the Proof of Service and file it with the court clerk in the county where you live (the same place you filed your Notice and Petition papers in Step 2).</ol><h4 class="step">Investigation by DA</h4><ol class="text">After you file your petition, the judge may ask the DA to do an investigation of your life, conduct, and rehabilitation since your release. As part of the investigation, the DA may contact you directly; may talk to your family, employer, and neighbors; and may also get any records or reports related to your conviction, including trial documents, prison records, and probation/parole reports. Afterward, the DA will prepare a report for the judge, which will help the judge decide whether to grant your COR.</ol><h4 class="step">The Court Hearing</h4><ol class="text">Make sure you attend your court hearing on the date and time the clerk gave you! Remember, the hearing is your chance to make a good impression on the judge!During the hearing, the judge will consider your criminal history, your behavior in custody, and your conduct since your release. The judge will look at any reports or records from the District Attorney’s investigation, and may also ask you or other people to answer questions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3139" id="footnote-ref-3139">[3139]</a></sup></sup> You should be prepared to answer any questions from the judge about your conviction, your life and conduct since then, and any information in your petition. Just like in a criminal case, make sure to stay calm and respectful no matter what is said about you or your past. In order to grant your COR, the court must find that you are rehabilitated and ready to be a responsible member of society—in other words, that you are ready to have all the <em>civil and political rights of citizenship</em>. If you are required to register as a sex offender due to your conviction, the judge must also find that you do not pose any threat of committing any sex offenses against children.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3140" id="footnote-ref-3140">[3140]</a></sup></sup></ol><h4 class="step">Success! </h4><p class="text">If the judge grants your request for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, s/he will give you your certificate, and will also send a copy to the Governor’s Office. The COR serves as an official recommendation from the judge that the Governor grant you a full pardon. The COR also automatically serves as your application to the Governor for a pardon, so you will not have to do anything more to apply for one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3141" id="footnote-ref-3141">[3141]</a></sup></sup> (For information about Governor’s pardons, see PG. 1082, and APPENDIX W, on PG. 1152.)</p><h4 class="step">If Denied, The Appeal</h4><ol class="text">If the judge decides not to grant your Certificate of Rehabilitation, you can re-apply for a COR any time in the future.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3142" id="footnote-ref-3142">[3142]</a></sup></sup> However, pay attention to the judge’s reasons for denying your request so that you can fix or improve them before you re-file. This will increase your chances of being granted a COR the next time. If the judge set a new period of rehabilitation for you (because you served consecutive prison terms, or you have a new conviction), you will need to wait out this additional period before you can re-apply for a COR.</ol><div class="appendix"><a id="EX_App_W_GovernPardon_Application"></a>APPENDIX W</div><div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppW"></a>Governor’s Pardon—Application For Traditional Pardon Directly From Governor (Without Certificate Of Rehabilitation)</div><h4 class="step">The Application</h4><h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT: </h4><p><strong>If you are applying for a Traditional Pardon directly from the Governor, you may want to emphasize and explain the following:</strong></p><ul class="sidebox">Your excellent conduct since your conviction;You have led an honest and upstanding life since your conviction;You have contributed to your community and been a responsible member of society;Your responsibilities and accomplishments, including work, school, volunteering, family situation, community involvement, and/or religion;You have avoided any further criminal activity.</ul><p class="text">You will need to fill out the “Application for Gubernatorial Pardon” with information about the conviction you want pardoned, any other convictions on your record, and why you deserve a pardon.</p><p class="answer">You can get the application online at: <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/s_pardonsandcommutations.php">http://gov.ca.gov/s_pardonsandcommutations.php</a>, <em>or</em> request an application by mail from the Governor’s office:</p><p class="address">Governor’s OfficeState CapitolATTN: Legal AffairsSacramento, CA 95814</p><p class="text">(There is a <em>sample</em> application in included in APPENDIX FF, on PG. 1173, however, you should try to get a new copy from the Governor’s Office or online, in case there are recent changes).

Follow the instructions carefully, especially when you are asked to list the arrests or charges that you want sealed. ONLY THE ONES YOU LIST WILL BE SEALED!

If it does, be sure to ask the clerk if the clerk’s office will serve it, or if you have to serve the papers yourself. After you have filed your petition, you will get a court date for a hearing. The clerk may set the hearing date when you file your petition, or you may receive a Notice of Hearing in the mail (it can take several weeks to get your Notice of Hearing by mail). </ol><h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4><ol class="text">At the hearing, the judge will consider your petition AND get a recommendation from the probation department about whether your record should be sealed. You are not required to attend the hearing, but it is a good idea to go so that you can answer any questions that the judge might have. You are also allowed to bring witnesses to testify on your behalf (such as a pastor, teacher, employer, counselor, or other people who know you and can speak positively about you). After the hearing, the judge will rule on (decide) whether or not to seal your records. If the judge grants your petition and seals your records, s/he will also order all other agencies that have juvenile records on you (such as the police, probation department, DOJ, and DA) to seal their records also. </ol><h4 class="step">Appeal</h4><p class="text">If the judge denies your petition, ask the judge if and when you will be able to re-file your petition.

Rebound is a <em>reentry legal advocacy nonprofit.</em></strong><em> </em>Our approach is based on the idea that <strong>attorneys and advocates</strong> can transfer powerful legal knowledge and skills to those who are in reentry and otherwise impacted by the criminal justice system, as well as the families, agencies, and communities that support them. With such a severe "justice gap" in our country and only one legal aid attorney for every 8,000 indigent people in California, we aim to <strong>create and share reentry legal information and resources</strong> that empower people to know their rights and options in reentry, with an educational approach instead of the traditional 1-to-1 client-attorney relationship.As part of our approach, we produce reentry resources like the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, and other accompanying toolkits; we train community members, currently and formerly incarcerated people, and professionals working with the reentry population on this information; we run our weekly <strong>Reentry Legal Hotline</strong> (every Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., at 510-279-4662—we accept Collect Calls); and we respond to prison mail from currently incarcerated people looking for information about their rights, options, and supportive services in reentry.We realize that information about legal issues related to reentry are often accompanied by the need to meet other basic needs post-release as well, <strong>things like food, housing, employment, health care and treatment</strong>, and other forms of social services support. While Root &amp; Rebound is NOT a social service agency—meaning we do <em>not</em> directly provide housing or jobs—we recognize the importance of making those connections with social services providers in the community and <strong>do our absolute best to know which agencies across the state of California are providing supportive social services to people in reentry.</strong>We are constantly discovering new community resources in California, and they are always expanding, diversifying, closing or otherwise changing. Because of this, it was not practical to list every social service agency in our <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide. Instead, we have created a series of <strong>county-based template information letters</strong> at our office. The information letters are collections of referral lists and flyers, guides produced by other organizations, and directories from county governments, as well as contact information for the organizations we have worked with or trained in the past.

Because of the major changes in parole laws, the court overseeing Valdivia decided that the case is “moot” (meaning no longer applicable) and that any problems with the new parole revocation procedures will have to be raised in new cases. Thus, advocates for people on parole have expressed concerns that there could be long delays between the placement of parole holds in jail and CDCR’s filing of revocation petitions. Advocates are also concerned that parolees may be pressured into giving up their rights and taking “screening offers” (like a parole revocation plea bargain) without having an opportunity to consult with an attorney. <em>See also</em> Prison Law Office, The Parolee Rights Manual at 43, <a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf">http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-559">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-560"><p> Cal.

Thus, upon the your request, the people who gave the information that proves the parole violation charge should be made available for you to question them at the hearing, unless the judge determines that requiring the witness to appear would create a risk of harm. If the state has “good cause” (a good explanation or reason) for failing to present a witness and that good cause outweighs your right to confront the witness, the witness’s prior statements may be presented at the hearing, even if those statements were made outside of court. The more important the witness’s testimony is to the case, the stronger your right to confront and cross-examine that witness is. Courts may overturn a parole revocation if the hearing officer relies on unsworn hearsay (out of court statements) without determining the unavailability of the declarant or the reliability of the hearsay, or without considering the parolee’s interests prior to admitting the evidence. <em>See, e.g.</em>, In re Miller, 145 Cal.

Brewer, the U.S. Supreme Court established minimal due process requirements for parole revocation proceedings under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 408 U.S. 471, 488-89 (1972). With regard to the revocation of probation, the Court subsequently held that “a probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in Morrissey.” Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973). Thus, the State “must provide the same process [found in Morrissey ] when terminating a probationer from probation.” State v. Rogers, 144 Idaho 738, 742–43 (2007); State v. Scraggins, 153 Idaho 867, 871 (2012). While Morrissey and Gagnon holdings make clear that probationers do not retain the full constitutional protections afforded criminal defendants, a probationer has a protected liberty interest in continued probation, and is therefore entitled to due process before probation may be revoked. Morrissey and Gagnon set forth those minimum due process requirements. <em>See</em> State v. Scraggins, 153 Idaho 867, 871 (2012).

Ultimately, this recommendation is reflected in a Guideline Sentencing Range sitting at the intersection of the applicable Offense Level and Criminal History Category. <em>See</em> United States Sentencing Guidelines 2014 Sentencing Table, <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2014/2014sentencing_table.pdf">http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2014/2014sentencing_table.pdf</a>; U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 General Application Principles, <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2014/GLMFull.pdf">http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2014/GLMFull.pdf</a>. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that probation be imposed for at least one year, but no longer than five years, if the Guideline Offense Level is 6 or greater. When the Guideline Offense Level is less than 6, the Guidelines recommend probation be imposed for no greater than three years. <em>See</em> U.S.S.G. § 5B1.2(a), Term of Probation, <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2013/manual-pdf/2013_Guidelines_Manual_Full.pdf">http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2013/manual-pdf/2013_Guidelines_Manual_Full.pdf</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-764">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-765"><p> 18 U.S.C. § 3564(c). <a href="#footnote-ref-765">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-766"><p> <em>See</em> Federal Defenders of New York, Supervised Release, <a href="http://federaldefendersny.org/information-for-client-and-families/supervised-release.html">http://federaldefendersny.org/information-for-client-and-families/supervised-release.html</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-766">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-767"><p> 18 U.S.C. § 3564(c). <a href="#footnote-ref-767">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-768"><p> In 2011, the Sentencing Commission issued a policy statement informing judges that they may let former narcotics abusers from supervised release early, if that person has successfully completed a treatment program. <em>See</em> United States Sentencing Commission, 2013 Guidelines Manual, <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2013/2013-5d12">http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2013/2013-5d12</a>. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1)-(2). <a href="#footnote-ref-768">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-769"><p> <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1)-(7). <a href="#footnote-ref-769">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-770"><p> 18 U.S.C. § 3564(d). <a href="#footnote-ref-770">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-771"><p>Reentry Council, Getting Out Staying Out: A Guide to San Francisco Resources for People Leaving Jails and Prisons, 30, <a href="http://sfreentry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1213-2nd-printing-GOSO.pdf">http://sfreentry.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1213-2nd-printing-GOSO.pdf</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-771">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-772"><p> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563, 3583. <a href="#footnote-ref-772">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-773"><p> This is because the Judge also reads all of the conditions to you at your sentencing hearing. <a href="#footnote-ref-773">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-774"><p> <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(15) (permitting the Court to order a defendant to report to a probation officer as directed by probation) <a href="#footnote-ref-774">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-775"><p> <em>See</em> Federal Judicial Center, Who Does What?, <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe!openform&amp;nav=menu1&amp;page=/federal/courts.nsf/page/360">http://www.fjc.gov/federal/courts.nsf/autoframe!openform&amp;nav=menu1&amp;page=/federal/courts.nsf/page/360</a>.  <a href="#footnote-ref-775">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-776"><p> 18 U.S.C. § 3563. <a href="#footnote-ref-776">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-777"><p> <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (listing the sentencing factors Judges must consider when imposing sentence). <a href="#footnote-ref-777">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-778"><p> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(b); 3583(d), 3583. <a href="#footnote-ref-778">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-779"><p> 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(10). <a href="#footnote-ref-779">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-780"><p> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563, 3583.  <a href="#footnote-ref-780">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-781"><p> 18 U.S.C. § 3563.

Parole of federal prisoners began after enactment of legislation on June 25, 1910.[1] Under parole, prisoners were eligible for release before their sentences were complete. Parole boards under the United States Parole Commission determined whether a prisoner should be released and whether or not a parolee who violated parole should be sent back to prison. The U.S. Parole Comm’n (USPC, or “Parole Commission”) was just reauthorized for 5 more years, effective beginning November 1, 2013. Despite the abolishment of federal parole in 1987, the USPC currently has jurisdiction over more than 17,800 individuals convicted of felonies under the D.C. Penal Code, and 3500 individuals convicted of the other kinds of eligible federal offenses discussed above. <a href="#footnote-ref-889">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-890"><p> <em>See</em> United States Courts, Probation and Pretrial Services-Mission, <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/ProbationPretrialServices/Mission.aspx">http://www.U.S.C.ourts.gov/FederalCourts/ProbationPretrialServices/Mission.aspx</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-890">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-891"><p> 28 C.F.R. § 2.38;

There are three general types of situations in which preemption may be established. One of the situations is that preemption may be in inferred where the scheme of the federal legislation is so comprehensive that it creates the inference that Congress “left no room” for local regulation in that area. Cal. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass’n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 281 (1987). Applying that standard, the area in question is eligibility for federally assisted housing and Congress has fully defined eligibility for federally assisted housing. Imposing an absolute lifetime bar when none is required is determining eligibility in an area that Congress has not left any room for local regulation. Success on such a claim may be complicated as the party seeking preemption has the burden of proof and the presumption is against preemption. Cipollone v.

App. 2010), the defendant credit reporting agency (CRA) disclosed information from the state’s sex offender website to a prospective employer. The plaintiff filed suit under a section of the penal code that prohibits the use of information from the website for purposes of employment, and the CRA filed a motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, claiming a constitutional right to provide information from the website to its clients. The court granted the motion, calling the CRA’s conduct protected speech under the First Amendment.

There are conflicting interests involved in providing the criminal record to both the applicant and the member of the family subject to the criminal record.

However, the regulation states that it is not applicable to public information or to criminal records information obtained from law enforcement agencies if the information was not sought pursuant to the regulations. 24 C.F.R. §§ 5.901(c), 5.905(c)(2). This exemption may be too broad. The meaning and full effect of the exclusion and its consistency with the statute has not been tested. The concern is that this may mean that if a PHA obtains information from a private consumer reports agency, it may not have to abide by the confidentiality provisions of the statute. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681u. Additionally, the confidentiality provisions of the statute most likely do not cover information the PHA or owner obtains from other sources, such as police blotters and newspaper reports. Nevertheless, advocates should argue that any information obtained from law enforcement agencies that is not otherwise publicly available should be subject to the statutory protections. 24 C.F.R. § 5.901(c). With respect to the management of the records, the statute references “any criminal records received,” whereas other provisions of the statute are limited to information received under the subsection. 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q), § 13,663(f); <em>see also</em> 24 C.F.R. § 982.307(b)(2) (PHA may provide voucher landlords information in PHA files). <a href="#footnote-ref-1201">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-1202"><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(4), (6); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(h). <a href="#footnote-ref-1202">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-1203"><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(7). <a href="#footnote-ref-1203">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-1204"><p> The broad scope of the PHA’s or owner’s liability may provide leverage for an applicant harmed by the negligence.

Cal. Fam. Code § 5230. If you want to make payments directly to the other parent (or caregiver) and NOT through wage assignment, you may be able to work out a different payment arrangement with him/her. If the LCSA is NOT involved in your case, you and the other parent (or caregiver) can agree to make child support payments in some other way, and can ask the judge to “stay” (put on hold) the wage assignment. In this situation, both parents (or caregiver) work out how child support will be paid and handle it between them. If the LCSA is involved in your case, the LCSA will have to agree to have the wage assignment put on hold. This may be difficult, however, because LCSAs usually prefer you to make child support payments through a wage assignment with your employer, and want all child support payments to go through the state payment system (called the State Disbursement Unit), NOT to the other parent directly.

The aunt had assumed full parental responsibilities and care for child, and the mother failed to present any evidence that child's best interests in permanency and stability would be furthered by the proposed modification). <a href="#footnote-ref-2494">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2495"><p> Cal.

Penal Code section 18 permits the court to sentence a person to county jail, thus making the conviction a misdemeanor although the legislature in the original writing of the statute, did not permit this alternative. According to the court in People v. Mauch, “By providing for incarceration in the county jail instead of prison, section 18 authorizes a reduction to a misdemeanor for certain felonies even though the Legislature did not provide for misdemeanor treatment in the statutory provisions defining those particular crimes. Because the Legislature has not elsewhere expressly declared any of these particular felonies may qualify as misdemeanors, section 18 creates, to coin a phrase, "stealth wobblers." Section 18's misdemeanor option, however, is limited to felonies the Legislature has specified are punishable by imposition of a fine as an alternative to state prison. People v.

The court further held that if the offense was reclassified as a misdemeanor under Proposition 47, then the superior court must also expunge any DNA it retained in the court bank, unless there is another basis to retain it apart from the reclassified misdemeanor offense. <em>See id</em>. <a href="#footnote-ref-2935">↑</a></p></li><li id="footnote-2936"><p> A felony violation of Cal.

Each of these circuit courts decides how the law should be interpreted within that circuit, which the district courts below must follow. This means that there are often discrepancies in the law at the federal circuit level—in other words, the same law can mean different things depending on where you live. These differences persist until the Supreme Court rules on which interpretation is correct. This is the current state of federal expungement law. Several federal circuit courts have ruled that the courts should be allowed to order expungements based on their inherent equitable powers—their duty to make things fair. Others have decided that expungements are beyond the scope of the court’s duties and that they infringe on the powers allocated to the other branches of government. The Supreme Court has not resolved the dispute. <em>See</em> U.S. v. Mitchell, 683 F.
