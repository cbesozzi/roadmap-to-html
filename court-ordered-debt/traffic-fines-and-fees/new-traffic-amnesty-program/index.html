  <h2><a href="/court-ordered-debt/traffic-fines-and-fees/new-traffic-amnesty-program/what-is-californias-new-traffic-amnesty-program/index.html">What is California’s new Traffic Amnesty Program?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What is California’s new Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Traffic Amnesty Program is a one-time opportunity to reduce overall fines on old traffic tickets that are eligible for the program.[2188] It applies to not just driving tickets, but any tickets or fines handled in traffic court. This can help you get your California driver license back if it was suspended for failure to appear in court (called “FTA”),[2189] OR for failure to pay traffic tickets/traffic fines (called “FTP”).[2190]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Each county is handling the program slightly differently. It is best to check with the local traffic court in your county for details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Where do I file for relief under the Traffic Amnesty Program? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You file for relief for EACH ticket in the traffic court in the county in which your ticket was given. To find contact information for your local court to see what tickets might qualify, visit: http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm.

  <p>
    How long will the Traffic Amnesty Program last?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The program began on October 1, 2015, and ends on March 31, 2017 (as of now). You may choose to participate in the program during that period of time.[2191]

  <h2><a href="/court-ordered-debt/traffic-fines-and-fees/new-traffic-amnesty-program/what-types-of-tickets-qualify-for-the-traffic-amne/index.html">What types of tickets qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What types of tickets qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Traffic Amnesty Program applies to all adult and juvenile[2192] vehicle code infractions[2193] (minor driving violations) due to be paid on or before January 1, 2013,[2194] as long as they were handled by a traffic court.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ANY person who is eligible to have a CA driver license, including undocumented persons who are eligible for an “AB 60 Driver License,” can apply for and get relief under the law (so long as the ticket qualifies). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other non-traffic infractions that were unrelated to driving could also qualify (like tickets for sleeping on the sidewalk, jaywalking, loitering, or turnstile jumping) but this all depends on the county.[2195] Some misdemeanors may also qualify depending on your county.[2196]
  </p>

  <h2><a href="/court-ordered-debt/traffic-fines-and-fees/new-traffic-amnesty-program/what-could-make-me-not-qualify-for-the-traffic-amn/index.html">What could make me NOT qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What could make me NOT qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are some tickets that do not qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program.[2197] For example, parking tickets,[2198] DUIs,[2199] and reckless driving tickets (like road-rage, speeding, racing, etc.),[2200] are NOT eligible for the Traffic Amnesty Program.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, you are not eligible to participate if you owe restitution (money damages) on any case in the county where the traffic violation was filed.[2201] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are also not eligible for the program if you have any outstanding misdemeanor or felony warrants in the same county where the ticket(s) was issued.[2202]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT WARNING FOR PEOPLE WITH OPEN WARRANTS: f there’s ANY possibility that you might have an outstanding warrant for your arrest—for ANY reason (including new charges against you or a failure to appear in court) from ANY county—it is recommended that you call the public defender or a private lawyer to check on your warrant status first, before trying to see if you are eligible for the Traffic Amnesty Program. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What kind of help can I get through the Traffic Amnesty Program?[2203] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    > You may be eligible to have BOTH your traffic court fines reduced on a ticket (by 50% or 80% depending on your income) AND get your CA driver license reinstated if . . .
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have an unpaid ticket that is covered by the program, and your fines were originally due to be paid on or before January 1, 2013; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have not made any payment on your ticket after September 30, 2015.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PAYMENT PLAN OPTION: It is important to note that the amount your fines will be reduced depends on your income.[2204] If you cannot afford to pay the full amount of the fine, even after the reduction, you can sign up for a monthly payment plan option.[2205] The payment plan will be based on your ability to pay the fine. If you receive public benefits or are very low-income, make sure to have written proof of this before applying! More information about payment plans will be posted to the California Courts’ website here: http://www.courts.ca.gov/trafficamnesty.htm.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    > You may be able to just get your California driver license reinstated (but not reduce the fines you owe on a ticket) if . . .
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You sign up and comply with a payment plan (including paying any court fees, which can be added to your balance and paid over time through the payment plan); OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You made a payment on your ticket after September 30, 2015. [2206]

  <p>
    Do I have to pay a court fee to participate in the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. The courts can collect a maximum fee of $50 to cover program administration costs.[2207] The fee can be added to the overall amount you pay, and does not have to be paid up front. It can be added to your balance and be paid through your payment plan. The DMV will also charge a $55 fee for reinstating (giving back) your California driver license,[2208] as it does for all license reinstatements.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you live in San Francisco County: The Department of Human Services is paying the $50 court fee (but not the $55 DMV fee) for any county cash aid recipients.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you live in Los Angeles County: The Los Angeles County superior courts are waiving the court fee (but not the $55 DMV fee) for people who are receiving public benefits or very low-income (below 125% of the Federal Poverty Line).

  <h2><a href="/court-ordered-debt/traffic-fines-and-fees/new-traffic-amnesty-program/how-do-i-enroll-in-the-traffic-amnesty-program/index.html">How do I enroll in the Traffic Amnesty Program?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How do I enroll in the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Call your local court. You can contact the superior court where you received your ticket(s) and ask about the Traffic Amnesty Program.[2209] Once you start the process by visiting your local court, the court will provide you with an application to enroll in the program; you will not have to see a judge.[2210] The court is then supposed to contact the DMV to notify them that you are enrolled in the program.[2211] To find the contact information for all superior courts in California, visit: http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    DMV PRINTOUT: While you wait, it may be helpful to get a printout from DMV of what’s causing your driver license suspension. Many of the details of how the application process will work have not yet been established by each county. While we wait for specific details, it is helpful to get a printout from the DMV that shows what is causing your license suspension.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    FOR MORE INFORMATION: Learn more about the Traffic Amnesty Program on this easy-to-use website about the program: http://www.backontheroadca.org/. You can also use this website to report any issues or complaints you are having with the program.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Talk to the traffic court clerk (or collection agency, if your traffic fines were sent to collections) about setting up a payment plan. Keep in mind that the payment plan may charge additional fees, as well as big penalties for missed payments—so make sure to ask about any fees and penalties before you sign up![2212]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can go back to court and ask the judge to reduce or forgive your traffic fines based on your inability to pay. (You can also do this at the time when the judge first orders you to pay the fines.) Either the judge or another county official will do an evaluation of your financial situation. Based on this evaluation, the judge will decide how much of your fines—if any—you will have to pay, and will set up a payment plan for you.[2213] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some counties have amnesty programs that can reduce the amount of debt you owe for overdue infraction and misdemeanor tickets.[2214] Contact the local traffic court to find out whether the county has an amnesty program and whether you are eligible.

  <p>
    What options do I have to reduce or forgive my court-ordered debt?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on the type of court-ordered debt.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    RESTITUTION
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As we have stated, restitution is mandatory and stays with you for life. However, a judge may order you to do community service instead of paying restitution if he or she finds “compelling and extraordinary reasons” for doing so. Again, your inability to pay is not a compelling or extraordinary reason.[2215]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    COURT FINES & PENALTIES AND COURT ADMINISTRATIVE FEES:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is often possible to get your fines and fees reduced or forgiven (“vacated”) by the court. However, it depends heavily on what county your debt is from, and which judge is considering your case. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In general, judges are more likely to reduce or waive fines and fees if you can show that:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You’re making an effort to pay your debts (for example, you’re paying restitution, even though you can’t afford to pay the other fines and fees);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You’re taking steps toward rehabilitation (for example, you’re in drug treatment or anger management counseling; you’re enrolled in school; you’ve reunited with your family); and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You’re following all other conditions of your supervision.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are some ways that you may be able to reduce, forgive, or otherwise satisfy your fines and fees:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some courts may allow you to do community service instead of paying your fines and fees.[2216] However, there is a lot of variation from county to county, and many counties may not offer community service at all. If the judge did not give you the option of community service at sentencing, you should contact the court or local public defender to ask if the county runs a community service program.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The court may allow you to voluntarily choose to do jail time instead of paying your court-ordered fines. You can get your debt reduced by $30/day spent in custody.[2217]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can go to the court directly and ask the judge to forgive (“vacate” or “dismiss”) or reduce your debts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you get your conviction dismissed, the court can forgive any remaining fines and fees you owe, including restitution fines[2218] (but the court CANNOT forgive your victim restitution).[2219]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PAYING YOUR COURT-ORDERED DEBT:[2220]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you owe payments on more than one case, make sure you specify which case AND which fine or fee within that case your payment is for—otherwise the payments may automatically go to your oldest case first. [2221] Remember, you want to pay off the debts that are conditions of probation, BEFORE paying off any other debts. Try to make small, consistent payments to the court. This shows that you are aware of your debts and are doing your best to pay them off. It may also keep the court from sending your case to collections.If you sign up for a payment plan, make sure to ask about the interest rate, any additional fees, and penalties for missed payments. Collection agencies often add extra fees and interest to your account, which could increase the total amount you have to pay.Keep a list of all payments you make, including the date and time, and who you gave the payment to (the court, county collection agency, FTB, or private collection agency). When you make a payment, always ask for a receipt for the current payment and a print-out of the amount you still owe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TRAFFIC FINES & FEES
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Expenses from traffic fines and fees may seem unimportant if you do not have a car and/or you do not drive frequently. However, remember that these fees (like the other fees discussed in this Chapter) may have a significant impact on your parole or probation conditions and/or finding employment. Because of their impact, it can help to find out if you have any tickets and if you owe any fees, so you can make informed future decisions about how to resolve your debt. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CONCLUSION	
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Many people struggle with different types of debt, but it can be particularly difficult if you are trying to rebuild your life after incarceration. If you have court-ordered debt, the bottom line is, you will likely have to figure out a way to pay it off at some point. Hopefully this Chapter gave you some useful information to help you not only minimize the debt itself, but also its impact on your life.
