  <p>
    I have a criminal record. Can I register to vote in California?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends.[246] A MISDEMEANOR conviction never affects your voting rights in California. If you have only misdemeanor(s) on your record, you still have your voting rights! A FELONY conviction could cause you to lose your voting rights in California, BUT ONLY while you are in prison for a felony; in jail waiting to be transferred to prison for a felony; in jail serving a “Realignment” felony sentence; and/or on state parole (but not on probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision!).[247] You automatically regain your right to vote after any of those circumstances ends. Note: If a judge found you mentally ill and ordered you to be involuntarily committed, you lose your right to vote only during the time of committment.[248] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See the chart on PG. 83 to better understand how your criminal record and supervision status will affect your voting rights.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I lost my voting rights while serving a felony sentence / state parole term. How do I regain my ability to vote? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In California, your voting rights are automatically restored once you’ve completed your felony sentence in prison or for a Realignment felony in jail, AND after your state parole term ends. All you have to do is register (or re-register) to vote before the next election (learn how on PG. 84).[249]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    the chart below explains if you can vote in California based on your supervision and custody status. If you fall under more than one category, and THE ANSWER IS “no” FOR EITHER ONE, then you cannot vote.

  <p>
    *A NOTE ABOUT A RECENT CHANGE IN LAW: A new law (“AB 2466”) was signed by Governor Brown on September 28, 2016. The law does not go into effect until January 1, 2017. Although there is nothing that officially says people in county jail under a “split sentence” or “AB 109 sentence” (also known as “Realignment” sentence) cannot vote right now, or anything in the law that says people on federal supervised release or federal parole cannot vote right now, there is also nothing in the law to definitely say they can vote until the new law goes into effect on 1/1/17. To be on the safe side, people may wish to wait until 1/1/17 to register to vote if they fall under any category above that says: “officially beginning 1/1/17.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don’t know my supervision status. How do I find out?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is very common to not know what kind of supervision you are on! If you are unaware or unsure of your supervision status, talk to your supervising officer or your public defender to find out what category you fall into. Tell them you are trying to determine if you are eligible to vote. You can even show them this chart to help figure out what classification applies to you! 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s also possible that you are on multiple forms of supervision. If you are on more than one type of supervision, and either one prevents you from voting, you cannot vote. In other words, if you look at the chart, both of your supervision status categories must say “yes;” if one says “no,” you cannot vote.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What if I voted in an election that I was not legally allowed to vote in? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. If you ACCIDENTALLY voted in an election when you had no legal right to do so, you will probably not be in trouble with the law. Voter fraud requires “specific intent.”[252] This would mean that when you voted, you knew that you were not legally allowed to vote, and you were voting with the purpose of breaking the law.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you PURPOSEFULLY voted in an election when you had no legal right to do so, you could be found guilty of voter fraud.[253] The punishment can be up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. That said, voter fraud is usually only prosecuted when large numbers of people have committed the crime in a way that affects an election’s outcome.[254]

    Registering to Vote in California: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PRISON ID:CAN I USE MY PRISON ID AS IDENTIFICATION WHEN I GO TO VOTE?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although a prison ID isn’t explicitly listed as acceptable ID, the law does allow a “document issued by a government agency” to prove who you are. (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 20107(d)(2)(E).) Your prison ID was issued by a government agency (either CDCR or the Bureau of Prisons), so it should be accepted as ID. However, since volunteers who work at polling stations on election day are not legal experts, you might have difficulties getting your prison ID accepted and may need to speak with a few different people. Remember: you won’t need your prison ID card at all if you provided a SSN, driver license number, or state ID number when you registered.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want to vote in the next election. When is the last day I can register to vote in California? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The deadline to register is 15 days before the next local, state, or federal election. You must submit the voter registration application form before midnight on the deadline.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you register using the online form, the timestamp must be before midnight on the deadline date (by 11:59 p.m.).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you register using a paper form, it must be postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election. (See PG. 85 to learn how to find your county elections office).[255]
