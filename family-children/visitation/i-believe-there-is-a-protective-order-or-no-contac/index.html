  <p>
    I believe there is a protective order OR “No-Contact” CONDITION against me. What can I do?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two types of protective orders (also called “stay-away”, “no-contact”, and “restraining” orders) that could be in place against you:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A protective order could be a condition of your supervision, required by parole, probation, or some other type of community supervision) AND/OR 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A protective order could be required by a court (put in place by a judge in a criminal court and/or civil court).[2269]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In either case, you MUST follow the protective order. While following the protective order, you can still challenge, fight or appeal it![2270] Read the question on PG. 909 to learn how.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PLEASE NOTE: It’s important to get to know the SPECIFICS of any orders preventing you from contacting another person. For example, a protective order/ “no-contact” condition may prevent you from contacting the caregiver or other parent of your child or grandchild; but this protective order may not apply to your child or grandchild, unless it specifically says so. This can create a situation where, for example, you are allowed to contact your child, but you cannot arrange for a visit with your child because you are not allowed to contact your child’s caregiver or the other parent.
