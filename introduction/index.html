                <p><strong>RESILIENCY MESSAGE</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Someone once said that <em>how you climb a mountain is more important than reaching the top</em>. I was in the San Mateo County Jail waiting to be sentenced to Federal Prison, when I first heard this quote. I remember saying time and time again how I was going to be different the next time. So many promises were made during those lonely moments that I never thought of how I was going to keep those promises if I wasn’t doing anything different. Life, I thought, doesn’t have to be the same for me. Blind faith, they told me, is what you need in order to trust those who are trying to teach you a different way to live.Unfortunately, in jails and in prisons, if you want rehabilitation, you have to seek it out. The same is true when you get out. The difference when you are out is that you have the power to choose when, how, and where, and although at times you might get discouraged because it seems overwhelming, don't give up. Remember, nobody said the climb was going to be easy.Now that we are free to choose, let's take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of us. Today, we no longer have to abide by any prison codes or rules, and if you keep doing the right thing, then the climb won't seem so lonely and treacherous, and the rewards will be enormous, as they have been for me.Keep in mind that the climb to anything, whether it's a mountain, a hill or a ladder, has to be taken carefully, cautiously and with an open mind. Each step we take has to be carefully guided and directed towards the direction that will cost us the least pain and regret. Even our old friends or acquaintances, although well intended, can bring us more harm than good, so carefully choose who you include in your circle. Cautiously approach any given situation, and when in doubt... don't. Luckily, we don't exist alone in the world, and regardless of who you are, you need someone. Collectively, rather than individually, we can accomplish more. So, have an open mind and pay attention to the message more than the messenger.Jails and Prisons don't have to be what defines us, or what breaks us; we choose who, what and where. Somehow, reaching the top is no longer that important, because the journey getting there is what will be embraced.Peace,Carmen</p>
                <p><a id="Intro_Mindfulness"></a><strong>MINDFULNESS IN DAILY LIFE</strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>5 PRACTICES TO DEVELOP CALM &amp; CLARITY</em></strong></p>
                <p class="text">As we all know, the process of reentry is incredibly stressful. Taking time to breathe deeply, to be aware of and to care for your body and your emotions, can be a big help. Mindfulness can help you to stay focused, calm, and balanced. ‘Mindfulness’ is just a fancy work for being aware of our thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Studies have shown that mindfulness can help reduce stress and improve our health. The practices and resources below may help you stay balanced and optimistic during what can be a challenging process of reentry. We hope these tools are helpful to you on your journey through reentry and throughout your life.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>MINDFUL WALKING</strong></p>
                <p class="text">As you walk from your car or train to an office, on your way to a meeting or job interview, try to be aware of your breath and body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest with your inhale and exhale, the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the sun or air on your skin. Try to leave early enough for your appointments so that your walk can be slow and unhurried. This simple practice can introduce greater calm into your day, and provide a few moments of relaxation before a potentially stressful situation.</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>SITTING MEDITATION</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Simply sitting quietly, with eyes open or closed, following one’s breath, can be a powerful way to calm the mind and relax the body. Many people find this practice challenging at first, but that it becomes easier over time and provides tremendous benefits for body and mind. Start with just 5 minutes per day using one of the guided recordings listed below, or visit an introductory class at a local meditation center.</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>YOGA</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Yoga is another powerful mindfulness practice that can help with reducing stress and improving physical and mental health. Local yoga studios often offer donation-based or community classes.</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>MINDFUL EATING</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Mindful eating invites us to fully experience and enjoy our food. Whether eating alone or with others, taking time to see, smell, taste, and appreciate our food, and taking a break from TV, phones and work—can make meals a peaceful time to refocus and enjoy life.</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>4-7-8 BREATHING</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Dr. Andrew Weil’s technique of deep breathing is a great way to calm the nervous system throughout the day. See www.drweil.com for details. The basic instruction is to inhale for four counts (“1, 2, 3, 4…”), hold for seven counts, and then slowly exhale for eight counts. Try doing five rounds of this breathing before bed and see how you feel.</p>

                <p><a id="Into_ChapterSnapshots"></a><a id="Intro_ChapterSnapshots"></a><strong>CHAPTER SNAPSHOTS OF <em>ROADMAP TO REENTRY</em></strong></p>
                <p class="text"><strong>CHAPTER 1: THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: Getting ID &amp; Other Key Documents, Voting &amp; Civic Participation – PG. 21KEY TOPICS:</strong>What identification documents (ID) exist, and why they are important.An overview of key types of ID: birth certificates, Social Security numbers (SSN) and cards, CA State ID cards &amp; CA Driver Licenses, U.S. Passports, tribal ID cards, library cards, voter registration, and Selective Service registration.Which forms of ID are most important.When and how to get each ID document, and which documents to get first.How to get certain documents while incarcerated vs. after release.A summary of options for ID for undocumented people.Voting rights with a record and how to register to vote.Selective Service registration requirements and how to register.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>ID is necessary to access public benefits and services; apply for housing and employment; enroll in school and other programs.Need basic ID to apply for other indentification documents.Voting is a key civil right to choose the government officials and policies that impact society. <em>There are many myths &amp; misinformation about voting eligibility—and the law changed in 2015 in California!</em><strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>People in reentry have only a prison/jail ID card, which is of limited use in reentry.People in reentry lack necessary documents to apply and enroll in programs and services for which they are otherwise eligible.People with records have driver license holds, suspensions, &amp; revocations, often due to court-ordered debts that they don’t have the financial means to pay back. Certain convictions restrict a person’s access to a U.S. Passport.Because of their prisoner or parolee status, people are disenfranchised and lose the right to vote.People who do have the right to vote under law are wrongly informed or wrongly identified as having lost the right to vote—missing out on the chance to make their political voices heard.Men who were required to register with the Selective Service Registration between the ages of 18 and 26 missed the time window because they were incarcerated, and consequently are barred from accessing federal financial aid until they can prove their incapacity during the time they were supposed to have registered.</p>
                <p><strong>CHAPTER 2: PAROLE &amp; PROBATION – PG. 130</strong></p>
                <p class="text"><strong>KEY TOPICS:</strong>The many different types of supervision in California, which includes<em>STATE FORMS OF SUPERVISION:</em> <strong>state parole</strong>; <strong>county-level probation</strong> (formal and informal); and the new AB 109 forms of supervision including <strong>Mandatory Supervision</strong> and <strong>Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS)</strong>.<em>FEDERAL FORMS OF SUPERVISION</em>: <strong>federal probation</strong>, <strong>supervised release</strong>, and <strong>federal parole</strong>.Step-by-step instructions on what to do when a person is first released from prison or jail.The length of supervision terms as required by law, including how the length of time on supervision is calculated, and how to get off of supervision early if possible.The “conditions” (rules) of supervision, including <strong>general conditions</strong> that apply to all people on that type of supervision, and <strong>special or discretionary conditions</strong> that apply to only certain people.How to challenge special conditions (rules) of supervision.How to transfer someone’s supervision to another location—a different county, district, or state.The rights of people with disabilities to have reasonable accommodations, and what types of accommodations someone can ask for from his/her supervising officer.A person’s rights during violation &amp; revocation proceedings, and how the revocation process works.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>Supervision affects every aspect of life! <em>→ A person’s housing, employment, relationships with family &amp; children, schooling, etc.</em>People need to understand their rules of supervision to succeed in reentry, and to avoid new legal issues or re-incarceration.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Being on community supervision can create barriers in every aspect of a person’s life. For example, supervision rules can affect:<em>Housing:</em> Where a person can (or can’t) live &amp; with whom.<em>Employment:</em> Work opportunities, requirements &amp; restrictions.<em>Family:</em> Legal barriers to family reunification.<em>Education:</em> Restrictions and scheduling conflicts.<em>Basic liberties: </em>Some (not all) constitutional rights &amp; freedoms may be taken away—like travel restrictions &amp; being subject to searches and seizures at any time.<strong>CHAPTER 3: HOUSING – PG. 351KEY TOPICS:</strong>Different types of housing options and tips for the housing search.Short-term vs. long-term planning for where some can live in reentry.Housing application process, including bans or restrictions related to past convictions.What criminal records and other records private landlords vs. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and government-assisted housing providers can access.Joining family &amp; friends in housing – the differing rules of government-assisted housing providers (including PHAs) vs. private landlords.Challenging illegal housing denials by both government-assisted housing (including PHAs) &amp; private housing.Maintaining housing.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>Housing is the first thing people need when leaving prison or jail.Shelter is a basic human need.Having approved housing plans is often a requirement of someone’s conditions (rules) of supervision.Many housing-related restrictions &amp; barriers.Extremely high levels of homelessness among formerly incarcerated people.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Parole / probation housing requirements &amp; restrictions can include: residential restrictions, a requirement to live in transitional housing, etc.Private housing discrimination – Private landlords are hesitant to rent to people with criminal records, and may both legally and illegally discriminate depending on the indivudal circumstances, sometime violating fair housing law.Public &amp; government-assisted housing - criminal record restrictions exist, but may be overbroad and violate fair housing law.Housing-related barriers to family reunification that prevent people from living with family or friends – these exist in both private &amp; government-assisted housing.<strong>CHAPTER 4: PUBLIC BENEFITS – PG. 479KEY TOPICS:</strong>Public benefits programs, by type, including: Cash assistance; Food benefits; Health care; Work services; Social Security benefits; Veterans benefits; and cell phone benefits.Eligibility &amp; enrollment rules, including any restrictions based on criminal records for each public benefits program.What happens to benefits while incarcerated, and how to restart benefits after release.Applying for &amp; keeping benefits - How to apply for each type of benefits and how to deal with denials, disqualifications or terminations of benefits.Resources &amp; referrals.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>High levels of poverty among people in reentry as well as their families, making public benefits programs an essential safety net.Many people have health needs, disabilities, and other special needs that are met through public benefits programs.Most benefits in California do not restrict people based on criminal records, yet myths about eligibility persist.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Some public benefits programs have restrictions &amp; bans against people with certain convictions (but most do not).There may be disqualifications for other records, such as: <em>Open felony warrants (some programs have </em><strong><em>“fleeing felon”</em></strong><em> bans)</em>; people with <strong><em>probation or parole violations</em></strong>; or people with a history of <strong><em>Intentional Program Violations</em></strong><em> </em>(these are non-criminal, but still affect eligibility for some programs).There are myths &amp; misinformation – Some people may not know the exact program rules, especially new rules that have removed old drug felon bans. Even county welfare agency workers may not apply the correct rules.<strong>CHAPTER 5: EMPLOYMENT – PG. 595KEY TOPICS:</strong>Job readiness, applications, and interviewing well - <em>Presenting your best self.</em>Hiring incentives for employers.People’s rights with respect to background checks, including the following topics:<em>Job seeker’s rights.When an employer can ask about criminal records, and how it depends on the type of employer.Private, commercial background checks vs. “in-house” background checks.Errors in background checks.</em>Discrimination based on criminal record - <em>Legal &amp; illegal forms of discrimination</em> and <em>how to file a complaint.</em>Legal restrictions in employment &amp; professional licensing.Alternatives to traditional employment, including starting a business, worker-owned cooperatives, and more.The rights of people with disabilities to ask for reasonable accommodations from employers.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT:</strong>Having or seeking employment is often a requirement of someone’s supervision conditions.Employment is critical for many as a source of income – which impacts <em>someone’s ability to afford housing, pay childcare, child support, or other court-ordered debt, go back to school, etc.</em>Self-efficacy, and contributing to society.Creates a structure of stability &amp; routine.In some cases, stable employment might be required to reconnect with children in reentry.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY:</strong>Background checks:Criminal history info is readily available from many sources.There are commonly errors &amp; illegally reported information in them.Illegal use of criminal history information.Statutory employment &amp; licensing restrictions:Job-specific prohibitions that may prevent people with records from holding some jobs.Professional/occupational licensing rules, regulations, &amp; restrictions that may prevent people with records from getting certain professional/occupational licenses, or will require them to go through a lengthy appeals process to successfully get a license.Discrimination based on criminal record:People with criminal records experience both legal and illegal discrimination in employment, and often overlaps with other issues like racial discrimination in employment decisions.There is individual discrimination and discriminatory policies to be aware of.Intentional discrimination by employers – may be hidden, difficult to prove.Unintentional violations by employers - employers may be unaware of laws forbidding certain types of discrimination on the basis of someone’s criminal record.<strong>CHAPTER 6: COURT-ORDERED DEBT – PG. 717KEY TOPICS:</strong>Understanding the different types of court-ordered debt, and what they are for, including: <em>Restitution;</em> <em>Court fines &amp; penalties; Administrative fees</em>; and <em>Traffic fines.</em>Taking control of court-ordered debt - <em>Figuring out how much debt is owed &amp; to whom.</em>Paying off or otherwise satisfying court-ordered debt, including:<em>How to pay off a debt &amp; what to do if a person can’t pay.Opportunities to reduce debt.Consequences of unpaid debts.</em><strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>People often leave prison and jail owing significant money in court-ordered debt.Debts can be owed in many different places:<em>Courts, collection agencies, victim restitution board, etc.It can be difficult to track down multiple and old debts.</em>Debts may increase during incarceration through <em>interest, administrative fees, and late-payment penalties.</em>Court-ordered debt created financial, legal, and practical barriers to reentry.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>There are multiple types/sources of debt, and people may owe multiple debts for a single conviction – this adds up FAST!During incarceration, debts may continue to increase.After release:Paying off court-ordered debt is a common condition (rule) of parole/probation.Probation can be extended for unpaid debt!Harder to clean up criminal record (expungement) if someone has unpaid criminal justice debt.Driver license may be suspended for unpaid court-ordered debts.Debts may be sent to collections agencies, which can lead to wage garnishment, bank &amp; property liens, a lower credit score; they also have a negative impact on housing, employment, credit opportunities, etc.Tracking down old fines &amp; tickets can be difficult.<strong>CHAPTER 7: FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN – PG. 784KEY TOPICS:</strong>Re-connecting with a child after incarceration, including:First steps to take in reconnecting, and locating a child.Finding out if there are any current or past court cases involving the child(ren), or court orders, and how to start or join a court case regarding children.Restraining &amp; protective orders that can impact a parent or caregiver’s rights.Criminal record-related barriers to reconnecting with a child.An overview of custody &amp; visitation.The three key courts that handle family-related issues in California, including: Probate Court (handles guardianships with no Child Protective Services or “CPS” involvement); Juvenile Dependency Court (cases where CPS is involved); and Family Court. (We also have an overview of juvenile delinquency courts, though the juvenile justice system is not a focus of this guide).Paternity issues.Child Support and Spousal Support – Issues with paying debts during and after incarceration.Issues that arise during incarceration, like mothering and pregnancy in prison, and ending a marriage or domestic partnership.Domestic violence and stay-away orders.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>Incarceration creates wide-ranging obstacles to stable family relationships – especially regarding custody, visitation, and guardianship of children.Family is a positive and motivating force in people’s lives during &amp; after incarceration and can reduce the chance of being re-incarcerated.Issues that arise in family courts—especially regarding visitation, custody, &amp; child support—can create more barriers in the reentry process, for example: housing restrictions, debt that builds up, etc.People need to know about the resources that do exist, since there are not many legal aid offices that provide family law representation to people with records.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>Parents’/caregivers’ rights to custody &amp; visitation may be legally restricted due to having a criminal record and/or system involvement:The impact of arrests, convictions, incarceration, protective &amp; restraining orders, etc.Courts have full access to expunged &amp; old criminal history information, and can consider it along with proof of rehabilitation.There are three different court systems to navigate - Probate (guardianship) court; Family court; and Juvenile Dependency court—and some cases may go from one to the other, or open or close without a parent fully understanding the legal process.Other barriers to reunification include: parole/probation conditions; travel &amp; residency restrictions; protective &amp; restraining orders; access to housing &amp; employment; time constraints; etc.Child support debt - Payment obligations do NOT automatically stop during incarceration in most cases—usually people need to proactively ask the court to stop or pause the payments!Very few family law services for reentering parents/caregivers.<strong>CHAPTER 8: EDUCATION – PG. 922KEY TOPICS:</strong>Setting Educational Goals, including:Choosing an educational path.Prison-based programs.Parole / probation considerations.Current vs. future educational and careers goals.Assessment of one’s current education level, placement tests, and assessing learning challenges, disabilities, &amp; special needs.Educational Options including: Adult Basic Education; High School Diploma / GED; career &amp; technical training; college &amp; university degrees; college credit programs while incarcerated (distance learning, correspondence courses); graduate &amp; professional degrees.Paying for an Education - Loans, grants, scholarships, other financial aid, including any record-related bans.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>Investing in education during reentry can help people avoid re-incarceration:Several studies have suggested that educational &amp; vocational training can help prevent people in reentry from going back to prison.Many jobs &amp; job markets now require employees to have some level of higher education:Educational qualifications vary from job to job.Some jobs require special licenses or certifications.In general, the more education a person has, the better chances he or she has of getting hired &amp; moving up the job ladder, and the higher his or her pay may be.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>Application / Admission Process:Background Checks.Discrimination Based on Criminal Record.Employment &amp; Professional Licensing Limitations.Financial Aid:Felony drug offense restrictions are rare, but are not well understood.Selective Service registration requirement (adult men).Conditions of Supervision:Travel limitations and residency restrictions can affect going to certain schools.Curfews, work requirements, &amp; other scheduling conflicts after school schedule.<strong>CHAPTER 9: UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD – PG. 1029KEY TOPICS:</strong>Types of criminal records &amp; what information they contain—and understanding the difference between RAP sheets, different types of background checks, and other public records.Errors in criminal records &amp; how to fix them.Who can see the different types of criminal records.How to get copies of criminal records.<strong>WHY IT’S IMPORTANT</strong>Cleaning up a criminal record can create more opportunities in reentry, especially related to limit what convictions show up in a background check, which can open up new employment and housing opportunities, and in some cases, restore certain civil rights.A way for someone to know what is on his or her criminal record and to take control over how it can impact life.This is the government’s way of providing official recognition of someone’s efforts at rehabilitation.<strong>COMMON BARRIERS TO REENTRY</strong>A criminal record is a long-term barrier to reintegration and access of civil rights.There are commonly errors, incomplete information, &amp; illegal information reported in background checks.There are many different sources of criminal history information, and some are always going to be public thorugh the courts.Many people can see criminal history information, including:Private employers &amp; landlords can see convictions from past 7 years, and in rare cases, special employers can see more than that.Public (government) employers &amp; Public Housing Authorities can see much more!<strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="appendixtocheading"><a id="Intro_Checklist"></a>“REENTRY-READY CHECKLIST” FOR CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE</p>
                <p>This checklist is intended as an <strong>additional tool</strong> to be used <em>with the Roadmap to Reentry</em> Guide. For currently incarcerated people in particular, this checklist is meant to help you become “reentry ready” for common issues and obstacles that arise in the reentry process, and <strong>to</strong> <strong>help you prepare now</strong> before they become problems down the road!</p>
                <p>We recommend you use this checklist along with the Guide, to help you understand in what<strong> areas you are already well prepared</strong>, and in what <strong>areas</strong> <strong>you would like to focus more on preparing for reentry</strong>. For more information on how to answer an item of the checklist, see the corresponding chapter of the <em>Roadmap to Reentry </em>indicated. Every person’s circumstances and needs are different, so use this checklist in <strong>whichever way is best for you</strong>. If you are NOT currently incarcerated, but have a criminal record, parts of the checklist may still be a helpful tool!</p>
                <p>* PLEASE NOTE: This checklist has been ordered to fit the timeline of reentry preparation from the perspectice of someone who is currently incarcerated, so it does not follow the exact order of the Guide.</p>
