        <p class="text">This section has important information about the legal requirements that apply to people who were convicted of sex offenses and must register as sex offenders under California Penal Code section 290 et seq. We refer to people who must register as sex offenders as ‚Äú290¬†registrants‚Äù below. In California, some legal requirements apply to 290 registrants <strong><em>only while they are on state parole</em></strong>, and other rules apply to 290 registrants <strong><em>for the rest of their life</em></strong>, so please read carefully!</p>
        <p class="text">If you are a 290 registrant, there are five main types of special requirements that apply to you: (1)¬†you must register with local law enforcement authorities, (2) you may be subject to GPS tracking while on parole (and possibly for life), (3) you may be restricted around where you can live (‚Äúresidency requirements‚Äù), where you can go, and where you can be employed, (4)¬†information about your identity, and in some cases where you live, may be disclosed to the public; and (5) the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) may place other special conditions of parole on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-455" id="footnote-ref-455">[454]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="subheading3">Registration Requirements</h4>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! If you are required to register as a sex offender, you have only 5 working days to register with the city police department (or sheriff‚Äôs department if there is no city police department) after you are released from custody or placed on probation or parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-456" id="footnote-ref-456">[455]</a></sup>Read more about registration requirements in this section.</p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861035"></a>Who has to register as a sex offender?</h3>
            <p class="text">Here we discuss three situations in which you would be required to register as a sex offender in California:</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 1:</strong>¬†You must register as a sex offender if you have ever been convicted of any crime listed in California Penal Code section 290(c). Cal. Penal Code section 290(c) includes a wide range of felony and misdemeanor offenses including forcible sex crimes against adults, most sex crimes involving children, prostitution and child pornography-related crimes, kidnap or assault for the purpose of committing a sex crime, soliciting another person to commit a sex offense, and attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the included crimes.<sup><a href="#footnote-457" id="footnote-ref-457">[456]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 2:</strong>¬†You can also be required to register based on convictions for crimes that are not listed in ¬ß 290(c) if you committed the crime ‚Äúas a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification.‚Äù <sup><a href="#footnote-458" id="footnote-ref-458">[457]</a></sup> This determination is made by the judge when you are convicted or sentenced for the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-459" id="footnote-ref-459">[458]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 3:</strong>¬†Even if you were not convicted of a qualifying sex crime, you will be required to register if you meet any of the following criteria:</p>
            <ol class="text">You were adjudicated (found guilty) as a ward in juvenile court for certain sex offenses and committed to the CDCR Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) (formerly the California Youth Authority or CYA) or the equivalent agency in another state;<sup><a href="#footnote-460" id="footnote-ref-460">[459]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">You have been found <em>not guilty by reason of insanity</em> of any offense listed in Cal. Penal Code ¬ß 290(c);<sup><a href="#footnote-461" id="footnote-ref-461">[460]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">You have ever been found to be a Mentally Disordered Sex Offender (MDSO) or Sexually Violent Predator (SVP);<sup><a href="#footnote-462" id="footnote-ref-462">[461]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">You have been convicted in another state or in a federal or military court of an offense that has the same elements as one of the offenses listed in Cal. Penal Code‚Ä®¬ß 290(c).<sup><a href="#footnote-463" id="footnote-ref-463">[462]</a></sup> Also, if you are required to register as a sex offender in another state, you are almost certainly required to register with California law enforcement when you are in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-464" id="footnote-ref-464">[463]</a></sup></ol>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861036"></a>When should I learn about my duty to register as a sex offender?</h3>
            <p class="text">When you are sentenced for a sex offense, the court should inform you of your duty to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-465" id="footnote-ref-465">[464]</a></sup> If you pled guilty or no contest to a sex offense, you should also have been informed of any registration requirement before you entered your plea.<sup><a href="#footnote-466" id="footnote-ref-466">[465]</a></sup> In addition, when you are released from incarceration, the custody or supervision agency (that is, the parole or probation department) should inform you of your registration requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-467" id="footnote-ref-467">[466]</a></sup> For example, if you are in state prison, your correctional counselor and parole officer should go over the registration requirement as part of informing you about your conditions of parole (see PG.¬†157). See PG.¬†169 for a discussion of the limited situations in which you might be able to challenge a registration requirement.</p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861037"></a>Do I have to register in California if I live in a different state but sometimes go to work or school in California?</h3>
            <p class="text">If you live in another state, but you are employed in or doing business in California for more than <strong>14 days in a row</strong> or more than <strong>30 days in a year</strong>, OR if you are <strong>attending school full-time or part-time in California</strong>, you are required to register in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-468" id="footnote-ref-468">[467]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861038"></a>Do I have to register in California if I move out of state?</h3>
            <p class="text">If you are moving out of state, you must tell the local California authorities in the city or county that you are leaving; and the notification must be given <strong>in person</strong> and <strong>within 5 working days of your move</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-469" id="footnote-ref-469">[468]</a></sup> After that, you don‚Äôt need to keep registering in California, so long as you do not spend much time in California (but see the previous question if you work or go to school here).<sup><a href="#footnote-470" id="footnote-ref-470">[469]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">However, you may need to register in your new state because the Federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) requires sex offenders to register with local authorities in each location in which they reside, are employed or are going to school. The SORNA registration requirements can last for between 10 years and life, depending on the nature of the sex crime and whether you have a clean record after being released from custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-471" id="footnote-ref-471">[470]</a></sup> It is a federal crime to live, work, or go to school in another state without complying with the SORNA requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-472" id="footnote-ref-472">[471]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861039"></a>I have to register as a sex offender in California. How and when do I register?</h3>
            <p class="text">If you are required to register as a sex offender, here are the basic steps for <em>how </em>to register‚Äîincluding important information on <em>when</em> you have to do it:</p>
            <h4 class="step">Gather the information and documents you need to register.</h4>
            <p class="text">As soon as you can (perhaps a trusted loved one or advocate could even help while you are still incarcerated), you should gather all of the information and documents you will need to register. This includes:</p>
            <ol class="text">The address(es) of <em>all </em>of your current residence(s) <em>(see </em><strong>STEP 3</strong><em> for more information)</em>;<sup><a href="#footnote-473" id="footnote-ref-473">[472]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Proof of your residence location‚Äîsuch as an ID with your address, a recent rent or utility bill or receipt, or a bank or official document showing your address;<sup><a href="#footnote-474" id="footnote-ref-474">[473]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">The name and address of your employer; and</ol>
            <ol class="text">The license plate number of any car that you drive regularly.</ol>
            <h4 class="step">If possible, call ahead to the city police department (or sheriff‚Äôs department if your city does not have a police department) to verify <em>where and when</em> you can register.</h4>
            <p class="text">Some city police departments (or sheriff‚Äôs departments if your city has no police department) have special <strong>locations and hours</strong> when they register people. Calling ahead can help you avoid wasting time waiting around at the police station. If you cannot reach the city police by phone to verify hours and location, that is okay‚Äîjust skip this step and go <strong><em>in person</em></strong>. </p>
            <h4 class="step">Within <em>5 days </em>of your release from custody or on to parole or probation, you must register in person with the city police department (or the sheriff‚Äôs department if there is no city police department) in every place that you live. Bring the information and documents <em>(see Step 1) </em>you need with you!</h4>
            <p class="text">You have <strong>5 working days</strong> after you are released from custody (prison or jail) or placed on supervision (parole or probation) to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-475" id="footnote-ref-475">[474]</a></sup> You must register <strong>in person</strong> with the <strong>police department</strong> in the city where you live, or with the <strong>sheriff‚Äôs department</strong> if you live in an unincorporated area or in a city that has no police department.<sup><a href="#footnote-476" id="footnote-ref-476">[475]</a></sup> If you live at more than one address, and your addresses are in different cities or counties, you must register with <em>multiple</em> police or sheriff‚Äôs departments so that you are registered in <em>all</em> locations.<sup><a href="#footnote-477" id="footnote-ref-477">[476]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="textbox"><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: The definition of ‚Äúresidence‚Äù here is broad and you can be ‚Äúresiding‚Äù at an address for registration purposes even if you are only spending the night there occasionally or staying there on a temporary basis.<em><sup><a href="#footnote-478" id="footnote-ref-478">[477]</a></sup></em></p>
            <p class="text">When you register, you will be required to provide <em>all</em> of your current residence addresses.<sup><a href="#footnote-479" id="footnote-ref-479">[478]</a></sup> Your fingerprints will be taken. You must also provide the name and address of your employer, the license plate number of any car that you drive regularly, and proof of your residence location, such as an ID with your address, a recent rent or utility bill or receipt, or a bank or official document showing your address.<sup><a href="#footnote-480" id="footnote-ref-480">[479]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Ask the police for proof of your registration. The police must provide you with a copy free of charge.</p>
            <h4 class="step">If you are a college student, employed by a college, or living on a college campus, you must also register with the campus police.<sup><a href="#footnote-481" id="footnote-ref-481">[480]</a></sup>Update your registration every year within 5 working days of your birthday‚Äîand more often if you fall into one of the special categories listed below.**</h4>
            <p class="text">Unless you fall into a special category listed below, you must <strong><em>re-register every year</em></strong>, within <strong><em>5 business days</em></strong><em> of </em><strong><em>your birthday</em></strong>, with the police department in the city where you live (or with the county sheriff‚Äôs department if your city is unincorporated or has no police department).<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-482" id="footnote-ref-482">[481]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>

            <ol class="text"><strong>If you have <em>ever</em> been found to be a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP),</strong> you must update your registration every 90 days, <em>and</em> within 5 working days of your birthday every year.<sup><a href="#footnote-488" id="footnote-ref-488">[487]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text"><strong>If you change your name</strong>, you must notify the police or sheriff within 5 working days of your name change, <em>and</em> within 5 working days of your birthday every year.<sup><a href="#footnote-489" id="footnote-ref-489">[488]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text"><strong>If you get sent to the CDCR or a state mental hospital</strong>, officials at those institutions are supposed to inform the California Department of Justice (DOJ) of your confinement.<sup><a href="#footnote-490" id="footnote-ref-490">[489]</a></sup> If you are incarcerated or civilly committed for <em>30 days or more</em>, you must <em>re-register</em> within 5 days of your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-491" id="footnote-ref-491">[490]</a></sup> NOTE: You do <em>not</em> need to re-register if you are incarcerated or civilly committed for <strong><em>less than 30 days</em></strong> and you then return to your last registered address (unless your normal re-registration date came up while you were incarcerated‚Äîin which case you still need to re-register).<sup><a href="#footnote-492" id="footnote-ref-492">[491]</a></sup></ol>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861040"></a>Do I have to disclose all my Internet accounts and email addresses?</h3>
            <p class="text">In November 2012, California voters passed Proposition 35 (the CASE Act), which would require 290 registrants to turn over lists of all of their Internet identifiers and service providers to the law enforcement agencies with which they register (see definitions in footnote).<sup><a href="#footnote-495" id="footnote-ref-495">[494]</a></sup> Registrants would also have to give written notification within 24 hours of any change to their internet identifiers or service providers.<sup><a href="#footnote-496" id="footnote-ref-496">[495]</a></sup> The internet information must be updated as part of the annual registration process, and the registrant must sign statement acknowledging the requirement.<sup><a href="#footnote-497" id="footnote-ref-497">[496]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">However, civil rights advocates (the ACLU and others) have filed a federal lawsuit arguing that Proposition 35 violates the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment rights to free speech and free association. In January 2013, the federal court granted a preliminary injunction, which has been upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-498" id="footnote-ref-498">[497]</a></sup> This means that the state of California cannot enforce Proposition 35 unless and until a court rules that Proposition 35 does not violate the U.S. Constitution.</p>

            <p class="text">You have 5 working days to register after you are released from custody or placed on probation or parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-500" id="footnote-ref-500">[499]</a></sup> When you register, you will be required to provide all of your current residence addresses.<sup><a href="#footnote-501" id="footnote-ref-501">[500]</a></sup> Your fingerprints will be taken. You must also provide the name and address of your employer, the license plate number of any car that you drive regularly, and proof of your residence location, such as an ID with your address, a recent rent or utility bill or receipt, or a bank or official document showing your address.<sup><a href="#footnote-502" id="footnote-ref-502">[501]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861044"></a>What happens if I fail to register as a sex offender?</h3>
            <p class="text"><strong>Failure to register is a crime.</strong> If your underlying sex offense was a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication, then failure to register is usually a misdemeanor for the first offense, and a felony for any further violations. If your underlying sex offense conviction was a felony conviction, failure to register is usually a felony.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-504" id="footnote-ref-504">[503]</a></sup></strong> </p>
            <p class="text">There is no end to when you can be charged for failure to register since California courts consider it to be a continuing offense (in other words, there is no statute of limitations to charging someone with this as a crime).<sup><a href="#footnote-505" id="footnote-ref-505">[504]</a></sup> If you fail to register after moving to a new state, you could <em>also</em> be convicted of violating <strong><em>federal</em></strong> registration laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-506" id="footnote-ref-506">[505]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">You can be convicted of a separate offense for each requirement you violate. For example, you can be convicted of two crimes for failing to update your registration annually and failing to inform authorities of a change of address, even if both offenses happened during the same time period.<sup><a href="#footnote-507" id="footnote-ref-507">[506]</a></sup> However, there are rules that prevent California courts from imposing sentences for two or more registration crimes that stem from one single act. For example, if you move to a new county and do not notify the police or appropriate authorities in either the county you are leaving OR the county you are entering, you can be convicted of two crimes but can be punished for only one.<sup><a href="#footnote-508" id="footnote-ref-508">[507]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text"><strong>The punishment for failure to register can be severe.</strong> Many of the crimes that require registration are violent or serious offenses, so a person who fails to register may face a doubled sentence under California‚Äôs ‚Äútwo strikes law‚Äù or even a life sentence under California‚Äôs ‚Äúthree strikes law.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-509" id="footnote-ref-509">[508]</a></sup> Courts have upheld some third strike sentences for failure to register despite claims that those sentences were cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs Eighth Amendment.<sup><a href="#footnote-510" id="footnote-ref-510">[509]</a></sup> In a few cases, courts have overturned life sentences where the failure to register was a technical violation, such as not registering annually though staying at the same address.<sup><a href="#footnote-511" id="footnote-ref-511">[510]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="text">To be considered a crime, your failure to register must be ‚Äúwillful.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-512" id="footnote-ref-512">[511]</a></sup> If you can show that you did not know you had to register or that you were unable to register <strong><em>due to circumstances beyond your control</em></strong>, then you may be able to avoid a conviction for violating the registration law.<sup><a href="#footnote-513" id="footnote-ref-513">[512]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">HOWEVER<strong>, </strong>it is <em>very difficult</em> to show that you did not know you had to register unless you were <strong><em>never notified</em></strong> of your duty to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-514" id="footnote-ref-514">[513]</a></sup> Simply forgetting to register is not a defense to this crime, even if your memory lapse was related to depression.<sup><a href="#footnote-515" id="footnote-ref-515">[514]</a></sup> But if you had a severe, involuntary (uncontrollable) physical or mental condition that caused you not to have actual knowledge of the duty to register, then you should be able to avoid a conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-516" id="footnote-ref-516">[515]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc352861046"></a>I am a noncitizen convicted of a sex offense that requires me to register. Will I face immigration consequences in addition to my time sentenced to jail or prison?</h3>
            <p class="text">The interaction between criminal and immigration law is very complex, and the answer to this question depends on what your specific conviction is, and/or what happened when you took a plea in your criminal case.</p>
            <p class="text">A conviction of an offense that involves sexual or lewd intent can have a range of immigration consequences. But in some cases where the offense is less serious, careful pleading and effective advocacy mey help someone to avoid negative immigration consequences (like avoiding deportation). If you are unsure if your conviction will trigger immigration consequences, it is recommended that you reach out to your defense attorney/public defender‚Äôs office immediately about these concerns. </p>

            <p class="text">Under Proposition 83, which became effective on November 8, 2006, if you: (1) have been convicted of a felony that requires you to register as a sex offender, <strong>AND</strong> (2) were sentenced to prison, then the law says that you must wear a GPS tracking device (usually an ankle bracelet) during your parole, and for the rest of your life.<sup><a href="#footnote-517" id="footnote-ref-517">[516]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">The GPS requirement does <strong><em>not</em></strong> apply to persons who were convicted AND already paroled, given probation, or otherwise released from custody BEFORE November 8, 2006.<sup><a href="#footnote-518" id="footnote-ref-518">[517]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">However, there are other laws that allow parole authorities, the court, and the Board of Parole Hearings to require parolees to wear GPS tracking devices.<sup><a href="#footnote-519" id="footnote-ref-519">[518]</a></sup></p>

CDCR can require you to pay to cover the cost of the GPS monitoring.<sup><a href="#footnote-521" id="footnote-ref-521">[520]</a></sup> But the CDCR can also waive (cancel) these fees if you are unable to pay, and <strong><em>must</em></strong> conside whether you owe any court-ordered fines, restitution, or other payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-522" id="footnote-ref-522">[521]</a></sup> If the GPS cost is unaffordable for you, ask for a waiver.</p>
