  Scenario 1: RECONNECTING WITH YOUR CHILD(REN) in Dependency Court
</p>

<p>
  Why would i go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with my child? 
</p>

<p>
  You would go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with your child or grandchild if CPS is involved in investigating an allegation of child abuse or neglect. As a parent, that could mean your child was taken away from you or the child’s caregiver. You would attend juvenile court proceedings to try and resolve the allegations of abuse and neglect.[2343] 
</p>

<p>
  A grandparent could be involved either because the grandparent is accused of abuse or neglect or the grandparent wants to become the child’s guardian while the investigation by CPS continues.[2344]
