          <h3><a id="_Toc352860964"></a>I can’t read, and/or I physically can’t vote by myself. Can I get help in the voting booth?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes. If you can’t mark a ballot because you can’t read, and/or because you have a disability, tell a poll worker when you get to your voting location (“polling place”).</p>
          <ol class="text">You have the right to use a voting machine that is accessible to you. Poll workers should explain how to use the voting equipment before you go into the booth, and should also provide further help if you need it after you go into the booth. They are legally required to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-278" id="footnote-ref-278">[277]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You also have the right to select up to 2 people (including a poll worker) to help you in the booth, as long as these people aren’t your employer, agents of your employer, or officers/agents of your labor union.<sup><a href="#footnote-279" id="footnote-ref-279">[278]</a></sup></ol>

          <h3><a id="_Toc352860966"></a>What is the Selective Service system, and why is it important? </h3>
          <p class="text">The Selective Service System is a federal agency that keeps a list of all adult males in the U.S. In case of a military emergency, the federal government uses the Selective Service registration list to draft men for military service<sup><a href="#footnote-280" id="footnote-ref-280">[279]</a></sup> — and to provide public service work assignments for men who are morally opposed to military service.<sup><a href="#footnote-281" id="footnote-ref-281">[280]</a></sup> If you’re a male between ages 18 and 25 and you live in the United States, and you don’t fall under one of the legal exceptions, you <em>must </em>register with the Selective Service <em>before you turn 26</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-282" id="footnote-ref-282">[281]</a></sup> To learn about the legal exceptions to registration, see the question below: “WHO IS NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER…?”.</p>
          <p class="text">If you do not register in time, there could be negative consequences. Failing to register is a federal felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 or a prison term of five years. You can also be denied certain government benefits — such as student financial aid, citizenship, federal job training, or federal jobs.<sup><a href="#footnote-283" id="footnote-ref-283">[282]</a></sup> Read on for more information. </p>
