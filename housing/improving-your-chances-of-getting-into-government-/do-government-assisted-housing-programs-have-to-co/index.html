  <p>
    Do government-assisted housing programs have to consider mitigating circumstances & evidence of rehabilitation?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Generally, programs are not required to consider mitigating circumstances and evidence of rehabilitation,[1164] but they are encouraged to do so.[1165] Only the Public Housing program—run by your local Public Housing Authority (PHA)—MUST consider mitigating circumstances (that is in cases where the PHA has a criminal record ban in place that is not required by law—see PG. 401 for more information on such bans that are allowed, but not required).[1166] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Good news! THIS GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND PRESENT FACTS IN A WAY THAT WILL PUT YOUR RECORD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT—WHICH WILL IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING ACCEPTED.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are ENCOURAGED to look at the following (and for the Public Housing program, PHAs must look at the following):[1167]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every application for housing on a case-by-case basis;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The seriousness of the offense;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The time that has passed since the offense;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The effect that denial of admission would have on the rest of your family;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The effect that denial of admission would have on the community;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The extent to which you have taken responsibility for your actions and taken steps to prevent or mitigate bad conduct in the future;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Evidence of rehabilitation;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mitigating circumstances relating to your disability or the disability of any family member; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Evidence of your family’s participation or willingness to participate in social services, reentry support, or counseling programs.[1168]
