          <h3><a id="_Toc312427170"></a><a id="_Toc314389793"></a><a id="_Toc317247593"></a><a id="_Toc448153692"></a>I receive public benefits. Can a portion of my public benefits be taken to pay for child support?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes. If you owe <em>any</em> child support payments (current and/or past, overdue payments), a portion of your public benefits payments can be automatically taken out to pay off your child support obligations. Your child support payments can be taken out of <em>any</em> benefits you receive <em>except</em> for General Assistance/General Relief (GA/GR) and SSI.<sup><a href="#footnote-2520" id="footnote-ref-2520">[2488]</a></sup> That means your payments can be taken out of your unemployment, disability, workers compensation, veteran’s benefits, or any other benefits you earn.</p>
          <p class="text">However, if you are already receiving public assistance, the judge <em>may </em>decide that your income is <em>too low</em> to owe <em>current</em> child support payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2521" id="footnote-ref-2521">[2489]</a></sup> BUT—this <em>only</em> applies to <em>current</em> payments. Even if the judge decides that your income is too low for <em>current</em> payments, you will still owe any <em>past, overdue</em> child support payments that were due in the past. You should ask the judge for a payment plan that lets you to make small payments over time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2522" id="footnote-ref-2522">[2490]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">(Remember: The only way you can avoid paying past, overdue child support payments is (1) if your child support order was issued on or after July 1, 2011, and the payments were due while you were incarcerated for 90 days or more; OR (2) if you get a settlement agreement with the COAP program or other parent.</p>
          <p class="text"><em>For more information on paying child support</em>, you can talk to the court Family Law Facilitator, contact the LCSA, or visit the California Courts’ website on <em>Paying a Child Support Order</em> at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1197.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1197.htm</a>.</p>
