          <h3><a id="_Toc448152917"></a>What could happen if I do not follow the conditions of my PRCS?</h3>
          <p class="text">There are different types of consequences for not following (violating) the terms and conditions of your post-release community supervision (PRCS). These include:</p>
          <ol class="text"><strong>INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS:</strong> PRCS agencies are supposed to develop and use “intermediate sanctions” for minor violations of PRCS conditions. Intermediate sanctions could include programs like drug treatment, mental health counseling, and job assistance.<sup><a href="#footnote-686" id="footnote-ref-686">[661]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>FLASH INCARCERATION:</strong> Another type of punishment for violating a PRCS condition is “flash incarceration.” Flash incarceration is an immediate return to jail for a period of up to 10 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-687" id="footnote-ref-687">[662]</a></sup> One of the conditions for being placed on PRCS is that you give up the right to demand a court hearing before being subject to flash incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-688" id="footnote-ref-688">[663]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>COURT PETITION TO MODIFY/REVOKE/TERMINATE PRCS:</strong> If the PRCS supervising agency (the county probation office) decides that more serious punishment is appropriate for the violation, the agency will file a petition to modify, revoke, or terminate PRCS through the County Superior Court. The probation office’s petition will be filed with a hearing officer appointed by the local Superior Court. Either the supervising agency (probation department) or the hearing officer can decide to keep a person in custody (in jail) while the petition is pending.<sup><a href="#footnote-689" id="footnote-ref-689">[664]</a></sup></ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">HOW DO I PROVE PERMANENT RESIDENCE?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">In order to verify that you live in the requested county, the county probation department will need proof of permanent residence. This may include:A face-to-face visit from a probation officer at your new homeA California driver’s license with your new addressVoter registration documentsA copy of a rental agreementA form from a friend or family member verifying that you will live with themCredit card or utility billsCar registration or insurance documentsNOTE: transitional housing does NOT count as permanent residence. </p>
