    What is a Governor’s pardon?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A governor’s pardon is an official forgiveness for your conviction, granted by the Governor of California. A pardon can potentially restore all of the rights you lost due to your conviction—including your gun rights and your right to serve on a jury—as well as eliminate your requirement to register as a sex offender. It is the best thing you can do to reduce the impact of your criminal record on your life, but it is still not a complete remedy because it does not make it as if the conviction never happened. (For more information on what a pardon does and does NOT do for you, see PG. 1189.) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A California Governor’s pardon is an honor traditionally granted only to individuals who have demonstrated exemplary behavior following conviction for a felony.”[3081] A pardon by the Governor is an official acknowledgement of your rehabilitation, by the state’s highest elected official. A Governor’s pardon provides significant relief from the collateral civil consequences of a criminal conviction. Both the California Penal Code and the California Constitution give the Governor the authority to grant a pardon, and that authority is entirely discretionary.[3082] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unfortunately, Governor’s pardons are difficult to get and are NOT granted very often, so you should try to clean up your record using other remedies first—such as an expungement or a Certificate of Rehabilitation.

    Governor’s Pardons vs. Felony Reductions, Reclassifications & Resentencing
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In most cases, you are NOT eligible for a Governor’s pardon if you ONLY have misdemeanor convictions on your criminal record. (In other words, you must have a felony conviction to get a pardon.) If you reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor under California Penal Code section 17(b) (see PG. 1174), or have it reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop 47 (see PG. 1178), you could become ineligible for a Governor’s pardon (unless you also have other felony convictions on your record). HOWEVER, in most cases it’s still better to have your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor—even if that makes you ineligible for a Governor’s pardon—for these reasons:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is MUCH easier to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor than it is to get a Governor’s pardon. Governor’s pardons are very rare, and you should not count on getting one.Getting your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor removes the felony from your criminal record and allows you to say that you were never convicted of a felony for that offense. But a Governor’s pardon does NOT remove, erase, or seal the conviction on your record, so you will still have to disclose that you have a felony conviction even if you have been pardoned.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: If your conviction is eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, you should absolutely apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation first, BEFORE seeking a pardon. Getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation almost ensures your chance of getting a pardon AND will automatically serve as your application for one (so you will not have to do anything else to apply!)
