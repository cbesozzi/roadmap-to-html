  <p>
    When can a private employer in California ask about my criminal record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on your city and county. For many years, across the entire state, a private employer could ask certain questions about your criminal record at any time, and most private employers can still ask these questions AT ANY TIME. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Recently, however, San Francisco passed a “Ban the Box” law that applies to private employers. This means that in SF, employers must wait to ask about records until AFTER they have determined the person would be qualified, just like public employers must around the state. For now, San Francisco is the ONLY county in which “Ban the Box” legislation applies to private employers, but other cities and counties are considering similar legislation. See Appendix G, PG. 780, for a full explanation of the San Francisco law, called the Fair Chance Ordinance.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition, the cities of Richmond and Compton have implemented “Ban the Box” laws that apply to government contractors—meaning private employers that have contracts with the local city government. If you are applying to a job with a private contractor in one of those cities, you should find out if “Ban the Box” would apply to you. See Appendix H, PG. 784 to learn about Richmond, CA’s “Ban the Box” law.
