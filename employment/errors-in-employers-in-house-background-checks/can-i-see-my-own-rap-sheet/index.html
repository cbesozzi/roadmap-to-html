  <p>
    Can I see my own RAP sheet?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. You have the right to get a copy of your own RAP sheet, and to correct any errors or inaccurate information in it.[1825] To request a copy of your RAP sheet, you will need to fill out an application from the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and get fingerprinted, and then send your application and fingerprints to DOJ.[1826] You will also have to pay a fee of no more than $25.[1827] For information on how to request a copy of your RAP sheet, see the Key Terms section on PG. 705.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To correct an error in your RAP sheet, you will need to send a written letter to the DOJ to explain what the error is, and where to find evidence or proof of the correct information.[1828] For example, if your RAP sheet says that you were charged with a certain crime, but you actually plead guilty to a lesser offense, you can tell the DOJ to contact the court clerk to prove the final disposition (outcome) of your case.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Important: Even though you are allowed to get a copy of your own RAP sheet, it is illegal for you to give a copy of your RAP sheet to an employer (unless it’s an employer who is already allowed to see your RAP sheet, as listed on PG. 723 above).[1829]
