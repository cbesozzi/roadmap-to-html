          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You cannot commit another federal, state, or local crime during the entire length of your Supervised Release. The court must make this condition known and clear to you.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You cannot unlawfully use a controlled substance. </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You must submit to one drug test within 15 days of release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court).</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Consequences for a confirmed positive drug test include:</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Possible prison time, and</strong></p>
