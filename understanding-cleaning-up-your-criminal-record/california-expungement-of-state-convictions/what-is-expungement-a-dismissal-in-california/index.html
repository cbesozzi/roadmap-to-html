  <p>
    What is “expungement”(a dismissal) in California?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Expungement (also called dismissal) is a way to clean up your record, by limiting the criminal history information that certain people can see in your background check[2897] and relieves you of some of the consequences associated with your conviction. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An expungement is also called a “dismissal” because your case is actually reopened by the court, the “finding of guilt” (your guilty or no contest plea, or guilty verdict) is withdrawn, and a plea of not guilty is entered. The court will then dismiss your case, and your record will be changed to show a dismissal (under Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4) rather than a conviction. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Getting your conviction expunged hides the conviction from certain people when they run a background check on you. For example, most private employers are NOT allowed to see a conviction that has been expunged.[2898] Additionally, most private employers CANNOT ask you about, or even consider, a conviction that has been expunged when you apply for a job.[2899] For information on how to get a conviction expunged, see PG. 1171.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Expungement does NOT erase the offense from your criminal record or RAP sheet. But it DOES change your record to show the conviction was dismissed.[2900]
