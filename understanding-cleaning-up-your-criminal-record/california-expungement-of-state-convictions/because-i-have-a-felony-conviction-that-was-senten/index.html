  <p>
    Because I have a felony conviction that was sentenced to county jail under Realignment instead of state prison, can i get it expunged?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe. If you were convicted of a felony and sentenced to county jail instead of state prison (called a “County Jail Felony”) under California’s Realignment Act,[2925] you may be eligible for expungement under California’s newest expungement law.[2926] This law is specifically intended for people who were sentenced under Realignment. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To be eligible for expungement of your Realignment felony, you must:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have served your entire sentence in county jail—NOT state prison;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have completed your entire sentence—including any probation or community supervision;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Paid all of your fines and fees; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Not have any new charges pending, not be serving a sentence on a new case, and not be on probation for another case.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is a SPLIT sentence vs. a STRAIGHT sentence?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under California’s Realignment Act, people who are sentenced to county jail instead of prison for felony convictions, can be sentenced in two ways:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Straight sentence—a person is sentenced to serve their entire sentence in custody. When they are released, they have completed their entire sentence and are not required to serve any term of supervision.Split sentence—a person is sentenced to spend a portion of their time in custody and the remainder under community supervision (mandatory supervision). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, BEFORE you can get your conviction expunged, you must wait a certain amount of time after completing your sentence:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you had a split sentence, you must wait 1 year after the completion of your sentence.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you had a straight sentence, you must wait 2 years after the completion of your sentence.[2927]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, expungement under this statute is entirely discretionary, meaning it is up to the judge to decide whether or not your conviction should be expunged. For this reason, you should be prepared to bring any evidence you can to show the judge that you deserve to have your conviction expunged. (For more information on discretionary expungements, see PG. 1168.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: What an expungement will NOT do. Even if you have your Realignment “AB 109” felony expunged:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It will still count as a “prior” conviction in a future criminal case;[2928]You still have to report it as a conviction to occupational licensing agencies and on applications for job positions in a government office;[2929] It does NOT restore your gun rights, so you can still be charged under “felon in possession” criminal laws;[2930] It does NOT restore your right to hold a job in public (government) office (if you lost this right due to your conviction).[2931]
