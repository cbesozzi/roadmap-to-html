<h4>FINANCIAL AID INQUIRIES </h4>

<p class="address">Financial Aid Past Default on Loans should be directed to 1-800-433-3243 or 1-800-621-3115. Students should ask what their standing is and nothing more. </p>

<h4>STATE LICENSURE AND REGISTRATION WITH THE STATE FOR CAREERS IN MEDICAL FIELD AND CLEARANCE FOR INTERNSHIPS/APPRENTICESHIPS </h4>

<p class="text">Many students have questioned the potential to be able to advance a career in specific fields/majors that require state licensure, registration with the state, or internships for units that necessitate clearance/background checks. We have found that each student should understand the "concern" when using ones criminal history against them. Depending on the type of credentials one is trying to pursue, each entity will look at the relevance of the crime in lieu of the career/licensure, (e.g. if you were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, applying for pharmacy school or becoming a pharmacy technician may not be the route to take), however we have come across state entities that have utilized one's juvenile record and were attempting to reject state licensure based on moral turpitude for having a criminal history in general. In order to combat this each student must be proactive in developing a healthy source of documentation on the contrary in order to detract from the legal distractions that do not have any relevance to the path contemplated and are used solely for the purposes of discouraging students from applying for a specific cause. We have successfully assisted students in receiving such state licensure but it indeed can be a battle, which can be overcome.</p>

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="ED_TOC_AppE"></a>More Information about Eligibility for Federal Student Aid and Drug Convictions</div>

<p class="text">If you were convicted of possession or sale of a controlled substance while you were already receiving federal student aid, you will be ineligible to receive federal student aid for a specified period of time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2876" id="footnote-ref-2876">[2842]</a></sup> This is true whether your conviction was a felony or a misdemeanor. The length of time you are ineligible depends on the type and number of convictions you have had for these offenses committed while you were receiving aid. The law differentiates between “possession of illegal drugs” and “sale of illegal drugs.” The table below lists the period of ineligibility by type of conviction, either possession or sale of a controlled substance and number of offenses:<sup><a href="#footnote-2877" id="footnote-ref-2877">[2843]</a></sup> </p>

<table><tr><td><p><strong>OFFENSE</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>POSSESSION OF ILLEGAL DRUGS</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>SALE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>FIRST</p></td><td><p>1 year of ineligibility from date of conviction</p></td><td><p>2 years of ineligibility from date of conviction</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SECOND</p></td><td><p>2 years of ineligibility from date of conviction</p></td><td><p>Indefinite period of ineligibility <strong>*</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>THREE OR MORE</p></td><td><p>Indefinite period of ineligibility*</p></td><td><p>Indefinite period of ineligibility <strong>*</strong></p></td></tr></table>

<p class="text"><strong><em>* An indefinite period of ineligibility continues unless your conviction is overturned or otherwise rendered invalid, or you meet one of the two early reinstatement requirements (see below). </em></strong></p>

<h4>You can shorten your period of ineligibility by:<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-2878" id="footnote-ref-2878">[2844]</a></sup></em></strong></h4>

<ol class="text">Successfully completing an approved drug rehabilitation program that includes passing two unannounced drug tests; or</ol>

<ol class="text">Passing two unannounced drug tests administered by an approved drug rehabilitation program; or</ol>

<ol class="text">Having the conviction expunged, reversed, set aside, or otherwise rendered invalid (learn more about expungement in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132).</ol>

<h4>How eligibility is determined:</h4>

<p class="text">The application for federal student aid asks whether you have been <em>convicted of possession or sale of a controlled substance</em> while receiving federal student aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-2879" id="footnote-ref-2879">[2845]</a></sup> If you answer yes, <em>or leave this question blank</em>, you will be sent an additional worksheet that you must fill out.<sup><a href="#footnote-2880" id="footnote-ref-2880">[2846]</a></sup> This worksheet will yield one of three results:</p>

<ol class="text">You are currently eligible for federal student aid;</ol>

<ol class="text">You are not eligible for federal student aid for part of the current school year; OR</ol>

<ol class="text">You are not eligible for federal student aid for the entire current school year.<sup><a href="#footnote-2881" id="footnote-ref-2881">[2847]</a></sup></ol>

<p class="text"><strong>REMEMBER</strong><span class="emphasisheavy">:</span> Even if you are not currently eligible for federal student aid (either for part or all of the current school year), you can become eligible if you complete an acceptable drug rehabilitation program OR pass two random (unannounced) drug tests administered by an authorized program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2882" id="footnote-ref-2882">[2848]</a></sup></p>
