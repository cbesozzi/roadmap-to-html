  <h2><a href="/the-building-blocks-of-reentry/issues-with-selective-service-registration/how-do-i-get-a-selective-service-status-informatio/index.html">How do I get a Selective Service “status information letter”?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How do I get a Selective Service “status information letter”?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can request a Status Information Letter from the Selective Service by (1) calling, OR (2) sending a written request. If you are requesting a Status Information Letter because you want to establish that you were incarcerated, institutionalized, and/or hospitalized between the ages of 18 and 25, be prepared to describe ALL the circumstances that prevented you from registering during that time, and have copies of documents showing all the dates you were confined.[309]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are requesting a Status Information Letter because you failed to register for other reasons, you must summarize these reasons on the request form. Note: You do not have to send a separate “explanation letter” to the Selective Service System — that’s only for the agency that denied you the benefits. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TO REQUEST:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By phone: Call 1-847-688-6888 and connect to an operator. Ask for a Status Information Letter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By mail: Get a copy of the “Request for Status Information Letter” form. Use the form in Appendix J, PG. 139, or visit http://www.sss.gov/PDFs/status.pdf, and print it from a computer. Fill out the form, sign it, and attach copies of documents to prove the information you write in the form. Mail the form, along with your documents, to: Selective Service System, P.O. Box 94638, Palatine, Illinois, 60094-4638.
