    What is the Emergency Food Assistance Program (EFAP)?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Emergency Food Assistance Program (EFAP) is a federal government program that sends food to county food banks. The food banks then distribute this free food to eligible individuals and households.[1404] See the next question to learn how to find an EFAP-supported food bank. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To be eligible for EFAP benefits at a county food bank, your household must (1) live within the region that the food bank serves, and (2) self-certify that they meet the income requirements. To see if your household meets income requirements, call the California Department of Social Services’ Emergency Food Assistance Program office at 916-229-3344.[1405]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you do not have a place to prepare food, you should ask the food bank to give you a list of soup kitchens, which also receive food through the state’s Emergency Food Assistance Program.
