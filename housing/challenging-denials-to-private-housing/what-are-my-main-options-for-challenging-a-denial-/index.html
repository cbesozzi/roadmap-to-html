  <p>
    What are my main options for challenging a denial to private housing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Blanket bans against all people with criminal records
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Treating your criminal record differently than others (arbitrary discrimination)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Landlord violated your right to notice of a background check, and your right to fix errors (go to PG. 426)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Go to Appendix H, PG. 493 to learn about how to file a discrimination complaint with a government agency. Try to get a lawyer to help if you can. See PG. 1286 of this guide for a list of legal aid providers across California.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a summary, your main options for challenging an illegal denial from private housing are the following:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You could file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You could file an administrative complaint with HUD (the federal housing protection agency);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You could file a civil lawsuit in state or federal court; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You could allow HUD (the federal housing agency) or California’s DFEH (the state housing agency) to file a lawsuit on your behalf.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I figure out which option to choose if I want to challenge a denial from private housing? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Talk to a lawyer or an advocate at a nonprofit legal services organization if possible—they can help advise you! Also, you can always file a complaint with both HUD & DFEH, but talking to a lawyer is important. More on each of these 3 options below.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For general instructions on how to file a complaint against a private landlord, go to Appendix H, PG. 493.
