          <h1>Clean up your record</h1>
          <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="EM_CleanUpYourRecord"></a><a id="_Toc448153394"></a>Clean up your record</h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">What about STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Some people find it more fulfilling and empowering to be their own boss. Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, freedom and flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibilities at work. Think about your skills, interests, and previous work experience or vocational training. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, read the section on “Alternatives to Traditional Employment,” starting on PG. 754 for more information and helpful resources on starting your own business.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153395"></a>Can I clean up my record? </h3>
          <p class="text">Maybe. Your record is not necessarily permanent for the purpose of getting a job. You may be able to clear—or more likely lessen the impact of (in other words, “clean up”)—your criminal record, making you more attractive to potential employers. For more information about the different ways to clean up your record, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132. </p>
          <p class="text">Different organizations may offer “clean slate” services in your area, such as:</p>
          <ol class="text">Public Defenders Offices</ol>
          <ol class="text">“Clean Slate” or “Second Chance Clinic” programs</ol>
          <ol class="text">Civil Legal Aid Programs</ol>
          <p class="text">For more information about finding “clean slate” services and programs in your area, see the list of legal aid providers on PG 1286. </p>
          <p class="text">For more information about ways to show employers proof of your rehabilitation, see Appendix C, PG. 773.</p>
