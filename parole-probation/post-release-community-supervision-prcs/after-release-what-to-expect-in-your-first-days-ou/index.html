              <h3><a id="_Toc448152905"></a>What must I do when I first get out on PRCS?</h3>
              <p class="text">You must report to your County Probation Department for PRCS supervision within 2 working days after your release from state prison, court, or county jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-673" id="footnote-ref-673">[648]</a></sup> Instructions for what to do when you first get out on PRCS vary from county to county. Please see Appendix Z on PG. 349 for some examples of the PRCS release process in a few California counties.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448152906"></a>Where will I be released to on PRCS?</h3>
              <p class="text">In most cases, you will be sent to the county of your last legal residence before you were incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-674" id="footnote-ref-674">[649]</a></sup> However, CDCR can send you to PRCS in a different county for various reasons, including victim safety concerns, to help you maintain family ties, or so you can benefit from work or educational programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-675" id="footnote-ref-675">[650]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text">Please keep reading for more information on how to make a request to be sent to a different county other than the one you last legally lived in.</p>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448152907"></a>Can I request that CDCR send me to PRCS in a different county than where they want to send me? </h3>
              <p class="text">Yes. While you are in prison, you can request to be released on to PRCS in a different county than where CDCR has assigned you—which is typically the county of last legal residence. Please read the section on how to request a PRCS County Transfer, beginning on PG. 222.</p>
