  <p>
    How many RAP sheets do I have?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime in California, you potentially have three different RAP sheets.[2850]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your county (local) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in that specific county only. If you have convictions in multiple counties, you will have a RAP sheet for each county.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your DOJ (state) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in all of California, but only California. This RAP sheet is kept by the California Department of Justice (DOJ).[2851] Unless you are 100% positive that all of your arrests and convictions were in just one county, it’s a safer bet to get a copy of your DOJ (state) RAP sheet to make sure you know of everything about you in California.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet lists any and all criminal justice involvement you’ve had in any state in the U.S., or with the federal government. This RAP sheet is produced by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI).[2852] Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet is also called an Identity History Summary.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See APPENDIX AA, on PG. 1265 for a sample RAP sheet.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Your RAP sheet is confidential! Unlike a background check, your official government RAP sheets are confidential. This means that most people—most employers, private landlords, and average Joes—CANNOT see your RAP sheets. Only certain people under certain circumstances can see your RAP sheet—this includes courts, law enforcement, government agencies, and special employers.[2853] Of course, YOU always have a right to see your own RAP sheet. (For a complete list of who can see your RAP sheet, see PG. 1152.) BUT: Even though RAP sheets are confidential, some of the information in them will likely show up in background checks. That’s why it’s important to know what information is in your RAP sheet, and to correct any errors. For more information about correcting mistakes in your RAP sheet, see PG. 1147. For more information on background checks and what information can and can’t show up in them, see PG. 1143.
