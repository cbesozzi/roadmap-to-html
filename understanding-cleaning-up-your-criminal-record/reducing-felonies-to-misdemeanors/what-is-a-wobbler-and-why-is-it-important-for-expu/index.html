  <p>
    What is a “wobbler” and why is it important for expungement?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted of a felony, but were NOT sentenced to a state prison term (or county jail under California’s Realignment Act), your offense is called a “wobbler.” A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense “wobbles” between the two offense categories. You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by reading the California Penal Code section that is listed on your RAP sheet. If it says that the offense is punishable by a fine or time in the county jail (misdemeanor sentences) OR time in state prison or “imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170”[2971] (felony sentence), your offense is considered a wobbler.[2972]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember, felony “wobblers” are eligible for reduction and ultimately expungement if:[2973] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT sentenced to prison time for the offense; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT sentenced to county jail instead of prison
  </p>
  
  <p>
    under Realignment;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG. 1165); AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for more information on these requirements, see PG. 1164). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For more information on expunging a felony “wobbler” conviction, see PG. 1165.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although the law does not require you to be off probation, you will have a better chance of getting your conviction reduced if you have successfully completed probation first. For information on how to get off probation early, see PG. 1172. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Felonies that CANNOT be reduced to misdemeanors. If you were sentenced to state prison OR sentenced to county jail for a straight felony under Realignment—even if the judge suspended your sentence so you never spent any time in custody—your conviction is NOT eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor.[2974]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, if you never spent any time in prison and you were not sentenced to county jail instead of prison because of Realignment, you may still qualify to have your felony conviction expunged (see PG. 1165).[2975]
