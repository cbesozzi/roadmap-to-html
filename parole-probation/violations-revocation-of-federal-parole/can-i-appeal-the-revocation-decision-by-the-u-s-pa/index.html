  <p>
    Can I appeal the revocation decision by the U.S. Parole Commission?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. It’s the same process discussed above (PG. 273) for appealing a denial of early release from parole to the National Appeals Board.[989] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The U.S. Attorney General can also appeal a Regional Parole Commissioner’s decision.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Attorney General, within 30 days after entry of a Regional Commissioner's decision, may send a written request to the National Appeals Board to review the decision. Within 60 days of the receipt of the request the National Appeals Board must affirm, modify, or reverse the decision, or order a rehearing at the institutional or regional level, and send a written decision to the Attorney General and to you.[990]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the Commission finds out you were convicted of a new crime after your revocation hearing for something you did while you were on parole, the Regional Commissioner may reopen your case pursuant to § 2.52(c)(2) for a special reconsideration hearing on the next regularly scheduled docket to consider whether you should give up your time spent on parole or any other consequence that he may think is appropriate. If he decides to change something, this new ruling will replace the ruling you got at your hearing.[991]
