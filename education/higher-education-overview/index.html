              <h3><a id="_Toc448153787"></a>What is higher education?</h3>
              <p class="text">“Higher education” refers to additional schooling that you take beyond the high school-level, that leads to a professional certification or academic degree, such as a Career and Technical Education (CTE) certificate, associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or graduate or professional degree. If you plan on continuing your education beyond the high school-level, you will need to determine which higher education path fits your needs and goals.</p>
              <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT TYPE OF VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE? </h4>
              <p class="sidebox">CTE programs commonly cover fields such as: agriculture and natural resources, arts and media, building and construction, education and child/family services, energy and utilities, fashion and design, finance and business, health science and medical technology, hospitality and tourism, information technology, manufacturing and product development, marketing and sales, public services, or transportation services.<strong> </strong></p>
