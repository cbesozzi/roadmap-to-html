  </p>
  
  <p>
    > MANDATORY CONDITIONS if you were convicted of a felony: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must also follow at least one of the following two conditions, as ordered by the judge:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pay restitution to a victim of the offense,[781] OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Perform community service.[782]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    EXCEPTIONS: You do not have to obey one of these two additional conditions if one of the following applies to you:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The judge imposed a fine that removed this requirement; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The judge finds on the record that extraordinary circumstances exist that would make such a condition plainly unreasonable, in which case the judge must impose one or more of the other discretionary conditions.[783]
