  <p>
    What options do I have if I cannot pay my traffic fines?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A Note ABOUT Traffic TICKETS:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes it can take several weeks for your ticket to show up in the court’s computer system. If you call the court and they don’t have a record of your ticket yet, don’t be discouraged! You may have to call back again later to get your question answered. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on the type of traffic fine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For parking tickets
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Talk to the parking agency (or collection agency, if your parking fines were sent to collections) about setting up a payment plan. Keep in mind that the payment plan may charge additional fees, as well as big penalties for missed payments—so make sure to ask about any fees and penalties before you sign up!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For misdemeanor and infraction tickets
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A recent change in California law has created a statewide Traffic Amnesty Program to help people who reduce old traffic court debt that qualifies and/or reinstate driver licenses suspended due to that old traffic debt. There are eligibility requirements, so keep reading to learn more about this new program.
