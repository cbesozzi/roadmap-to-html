          <h3><a id="_Toc448153175"></a>Does a private landlord have to tell me that the criminal record information that showed up in a private background check/tenant report is the reason I am not getting the apartment?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes!<em> </em>The landlord has to tell you if your criminal history is the reason you are not getting the apartment.<em> </em>If there is a negative action taken—like not renting you the apartment—because of a background report, the landlord must follow this 2-step procedure:</p>
          <p class="text">STEP 1: The landlord must provide you with a copy of the report and a copy of the <em>Federal Trade Commission Summary of Rights</em> before the negative action is taken—giving you an opportunity to clear up any inaccuracies in the report.</p>
          <p class="text">STEP 2: If the landlord goes forward with the negative action, it must provide you notice about the adverse decision, the contact information of the reporting agency, a statement that the landlord (and not the screening company) made the adverse decision; and your right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of the report.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1210" id="footnote-ref-1210">[1180]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
