  <p>
    What benefits and services can I get through MediCal?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As required by law, Medi-Cal covers a set of “essential health benefits,” including:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hospital care and emergency services;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Medical services;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Prescription drugs;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mental health and substance abuse treatment (potentially including treatment that is a condition of probation or parole);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maternity and pediatric care;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rehabilitation services;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Preventive care and chronic disease management; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some dental care.[1454] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Helpful HintQualifying for Medi-Cal Because of a Disability:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you think you qualify for Medi-Cal based on a disability, contact your county Medi-Cal office before you apply. Also, if you are homebound or living in an assisted care facility, you can ask to have a Medi-Cal representative visit you and help complete your application in person. For a statewide directory of county social services offices, see Appendix A, PG. 634.[1455]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Helpful HintRetroactive Medi-Cal Coverage
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When applying for Medi-Cal benefits, you may request retroactive Medi-Cal coverage for medical services you received during any of the three calendar months immediately before the month that you applied to Medi-Cal, so long as the services would have qualified for coverage had you been enrolled in Medi-Cal at the time. If you do apply for retroactive benefits, you must complete a supplemental request form. You may request retroactive coverage when you apply for Medi-Cal or within one year of the last month for which retroactive coverage is sought.[1456]
