              <h3><a id="_Toc448152900"></a>What is Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS)?</h3>
              <p class="text">In 2011, California’s “Realignment” Law (A.B. 109) created a new form of community supervision under which certain people leaving state prison are monitored by the probation departments of each county, instead of by state parole. This new form of supervision is called Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS).</p>
              <p class="text">As of October 1, 2011, people who are released from state prisons for crimes that are non-violent, non-serious, AND non-sexual are placed on PRCS under the supervision of county probation officers.<sup><a href="#footnote-666" id="footnote-ref-666">[641]</a></sup></p>

              <ol class="text">Some sex offenders; AND</ol>

              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE: If you were paroled from state prison before October 1, 2011, you will stay on parole, and not be placed on PRCS. However, if you are returned to the custody of state prison due to a parole revocation case, the CDCR will screen your case beginning at least 180 days before your calculated release date (see the next question about this timeline) to decide if you should be (1) returned to state parole or (2) placed on PRCS after serving the revocation term.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-668" id="footnote-ref-668">[643]</a></sup></strong></p>
