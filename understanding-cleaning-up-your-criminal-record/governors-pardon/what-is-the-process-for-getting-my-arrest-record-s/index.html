  <p>
    What is the process for getting my arrest record sealed?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The process for getting your arrest record sealed varies slightly, depending on your situation: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were arrested but never charged, you will need to start with the law enforcement agency that arrested you, and ask to have your records sealed. If the law enforcement agency refuses to seal your records (or doesn’t respond), you can file your request in court; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were arrested and charges were filed, you should take your request straight to the court first. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Either way, your claim will be reviewed, and you may have a hearing to convince the judge that you are factually innocent. If you are found factually innocent by either the law enforcement agency or the court, the records of your arrest will be sealed and eventually destroyed. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For information and instructions for each step of this process, see APPENDIX X, on PG. 1260.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NEW LAW NOTE: In 2016, California added a new section to the Penal Code permitting special factual innocence petitions for victims of human trafficking.[3129] Section 236.14 provides relief for any person arrested for OR convicted of a nonviolent offense while a victim of human trafficking. The court will vacate the conviction or seal the arrest if it is satisfied that: (1) the person was a victim of human trafficking at the time they committed the offense; (2) the offense was committed as a direct result of being a victim of human trafficking; (3) the person has tried to distance him or herself from human trafficking; AND (4) granting the petition is in the best interests of justice and the person’s best interests.[3130]

    Sealing California State Juvenile Records 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is a common misperception that juvenile criminal records are automatically sealed when you turn 18. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If you have a juvenile record in California, you must ask the court to have it sealed, otherwise this information may find its way into your background check.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: This section refers only to sealing juvenile records from California. Every state has different laws for handling juvenile records.[3131] If you have a juvenile record from another state, you will need to find out what remedies are available in that state.[3132] Additionally, federal juvenile records can be sealed only under the very limited circumstances (the same as federal adult convictions).[3133] If you have a federal juvenile record, it is recommended that you speak to a Federal Public Defender. Read about sealing federal adult records on PG. 1198.
