          <h1>Legal restrictions on certain jobs</h1>
          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="EM_LegalRestrictionsCertainJobs"></a><a id="_Toc448153464"></a>Legal restrictions on certain jobs</h2>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153465"></a>Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record? </h3>
          <p class="text">Unfortunately, yes… But this is very rare. Although we don't want to give you bad news, we also want to give you the information you need to decide which jobs will be best for you! There are a few situations when having a criminal record—or having certain types of convictions on your record—will disqualify you from getting certain types of jobs. It is important that you know about these situations beforehand, so that you can realistically set your sights on jobs that you can have. </p>
          <p class="text">Although this list is incomplete, below are some examples of jobs that have legal restrictions for people with certain criminal convictions. In general, these are jobs where you would have access to private or sensitive information (like financial records); vulnerable people (like children or the elderly), or high-security places, where there might be a greater risk of harm to the public.</p>
          <ol class="text">Airport security screeners (or anyone with unsupervised access to secure airport areas);<sup><a href="#footnote-1927" id="footnote-ref-1927">[1897]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">Federal law enforcement officers;<sup><a href="#footnote-1928" id="footnote-ref-1928">[1898]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Defense contractors;<sup><a href="#footnote-1929" id="footnote-ref-1929">[1899]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Prisoner transportation personnel;<sup><a href="#footnote-1930" id="footnote-ref-1930">[1900]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Port workers;<sup><a href="#footnote-1931" id="footnote-ref-1931">[1901]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Bank employees;<sup><a href="#footnote-1932" id="footnote-ref-1932">[1902]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Insurance personnel;<sup><a href="#footnote-1933" id="footnote-ref-1933">[1903]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Jobs that administer employee benefits plan;<sup><a href="#footnote-1934" id="footnote-ref-1934">[1904]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies;<sup><a href="#footnote-1935" id="footnote-ref-1935">[1905]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Working for a school district in a position that requires certification or a supervisory capacity (if you have been convicted of a felony defined as serious or violent);<sup><a href="#footnote-1936" id="footnote-ref-1936">[1906]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Most of the time, if an employer cannot hire a person with a record for certain types of job positions, the employer may still be able to hire that person for other positions. If an employer says that they cannot hire you for a job based on your criminal record, you should ask whether there are any other positions available that you could take instead.</p>

            <h3><a href="/roadmap-to-html/employment/legal-restrictions-on-certain-jobs/can-i-ever-be-eligible-again-to-get-these-jobs/">Can I ever be eligible again to get these jobs?</a></h3>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448153466"></a>Can I ever be eligible again to get these jobs?</h3>
              <p class="text">It depends. Each of these jobs has very specific rules about what convictions will disqualify you, and whether and how you can become eligible for them again. It will depend on the specific laws, regulations, and other rules that apply to that type of work.<sup><a href="#footnote-1937" id="footnote-ref-1937">[1907]</a></sup> It is recommended that you ask a lawyer to review your RAP sheet and explain how your convictions will affect your ability to get the job you want. See PG. 745 for how to contact an attorney. </p>
              <ol class="text">For some jobs, you are only disqualified for a certain period of time, and then you will become eligible after that time has passed.</ol>
              <ol class="text">For many jobs, you can become eligible if your conviction is expunged, or if you get a Certificate of Rehabilitation or a pardon for the conviction.</ol>
              <ol class="text">For some jobs, you can request a waiver or exemption for your conviction, which means asking the government to make an exception to the law based on your individual circumstances. You may need to present evidence of rehabilitation and other factors showing that your conviction does not pose a risk of harm and therefore you should not be disqualified because of it.</ol>
              <ol class="text">If you think you were disqualified based on incorrect information in your record, you may be able to appeal the disqualification and show that you should NOT be disqualified according to the law. For example, if you were not actually convicted of the offense that caused you to be disqualified for the job (e.g., the charges were dismissed, or you pleaded guilty to a lesser offense that does NOT disqualify you), you can appeal and present court records showing that you were not convicted of that offense.</ol>
