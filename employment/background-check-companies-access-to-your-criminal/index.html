<h1>Background check companies’ access to your criminal records</h1>

<p>
  Background check companies’ access to your criminal records
</p>

<p>
  How do background check companies get information on me for their background check reports? 
</p>

<p>
  Background check companies will use any available source to dig up information on you.[1833] They may look at: 
</p>

<p>
  Court records (any criminal or civil case you’ve been involved with);
</p>

<p>
  Police, correctional facility, and CDCR records (including mug shots);[1834] 
</p>

<p>
  DMV driving records; 
</p>

<p>
  Other public records (eviction records; tax records; property records; birth certificates; marriage and divorce records; etc.); 
</p>

<p>
  Internet searches, including on Google and social networking sites (Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc.); other websites (including websites that post mug shot photos),[1835] 
</p>

<p>
  Your previous school and work history, AND
</p>

<p>
  Talk with people who know you or have information about you (friends, neighbors, co-workers, landlords, etc.)[1836]
</p>

<p>
  If the background check includes any information from public records (such as court records), the background check company must state in the background check report:
</p>

<p>
  Where it got the information (including which court), AND
</p>

<p>
  When the information was reported (i.e., made public).[1837]
</p>

<p>
  See PG. 723 about the rules around accessing RAP sheets, which are confidential to most (not all) employers.
