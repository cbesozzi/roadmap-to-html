          <p class="text">Outside factors and life circumstances can have a huge impact on your educational goals. As an adult student, you may have work and family obligations to juggle. If you’re incarcerated or on parole/probation, you may have to work around special restrictions in order to pursue your education. </p>
          <p class="text">In light of all this, you’ll want to pick an education program that you can balance with your other responsibilities, and that fits your current situation as well as your future goals. For example, you may ask yourself: </p>
          <ol class="text">How much time do you have to devote to your education? </ol>
          <ol class="text">Do you have a family to support and take care of? </ol>
          <ol class="text">Will you need to work to support yourself while in school? </ol>
          <ol class="text">Are your options limited because you are still incarcerated or on parole or probation? See PG. 1040 </ol>
