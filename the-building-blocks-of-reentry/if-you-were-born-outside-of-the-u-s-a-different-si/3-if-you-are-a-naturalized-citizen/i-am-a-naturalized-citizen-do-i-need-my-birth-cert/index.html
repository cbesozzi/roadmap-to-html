          <p class="text">If you were not born in the United States, but immigrated here and became a U.S. citizen at some point in your life, you are a naturalized citizen. You should have been issued a <em>Certificate of Naturalization</em> at the time you became a citizen. This is essentially the same as a birth certificate for purposes of obtaining other ID documents.<sup><a href="#footnote-37" id="footnote-ref-37">[37]</a></sup> If your Certificate of Naturalization was lost or destroyed, you can apply for a new one. You will need to fill out an “Application for Replacement Naturalization/Citizenship Document” (Form N-565). You can call the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services, National Customer Services Center hotline at 1-800-375-5283 to have the form mailed to you. The form is also available online at <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/n-565">http://www.uscis.gov/n-565</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-38" id="footnote-ref-38">[38]</a></sup> A copy of the most up-to-date form as of the time of this Guide’s first printing (2015) is at Appendix C, PG. 110.</p>
