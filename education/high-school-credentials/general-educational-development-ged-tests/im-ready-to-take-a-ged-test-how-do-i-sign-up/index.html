        <h4 class="sidebox">GED vs. High school diploma</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Compared to a GED program, which may focus on preparing you to answer test questions quickly, a high school diploma program requires you to complete many classes that are part of a high school education. Required course subjects include: English (reading, writing, literature); math (algebra, geometry); natural science (biology, ecology, physics); social science (history, civics, economics); humanities (art, religion); and electives (health, media literacy).</p>
        <p class="text">This section will help you decide whether an adult high school diploma program is a good option for you. You’ll also learn how to locate and sign up for an adult high school diploma program that meets your needs. </p>
