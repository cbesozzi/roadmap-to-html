          <p class="text">You will likely STILL be in violation of the order. Restraining orders are not mutual, they are a one-way street.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2548" id="footnote-ref-2548">[2516]</a></sup></sup> This means that only you as the “restrained person” can violate the order, the “protected person” cannot. </p>
          <p class="text">It is your duty, as the restrained person under the protective order, to make sure that you quickly leave the area and do not try and communicate with your partner when you realized that your partner is in the same area.</p>
          <p class="text">NOTE: It is possible for both people to have <strong><em>mutual restraining orders</em></strong> against one another. To stay in compliance, you should follow any orders against you, even if you also have an order against the other person.</p>
