  <h1>If I get my felony reduced under Prop 47, how do I then get it expunged?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153941"></a>If I get my felony reduced under Prop 47, how do I then get it expunged?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Possibly. Generally, if you served any time in state prison for a felony conviction, you are not eligible to get your conviction expunged.<sup><a href="#footnote-3044" id="footnote-ref-3044">[3008]</a></sup> However, many lawyers believe that this is an oversight by the drafters of Prop 47, and feel that if your felony conviction is eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop 47, it should be eligible for expungement (like most misdemeanors) as well. Some lawyers have had success getting discretionary expungements for Prop 47 convictions under California Penal Code section 1203.4a (which allows expungement of misdemeanor convictions with sentences <em>other than probation</em>).<sup><a href="#footnote-3045" id="footnote-ref-3045">[3009]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="importantbox">PROP 47 AND FEDERAL SENTENCESEven though Prop 47 only applies to state convictions, it may still help you if you are serving time for a <em>federal</em> conviction. If your federal sentence was <em>increased</em> because you had a prior <em>state</em> conviction, and that state conviction can be reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop 47, that conviction should no longer have as much impact on your federal sentence, which may mean that your total federal sentence can be reduced.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3046" id="footnote-ref-3046">[3010]</a></sup></strong> If you are serving a federal sentence and you have prior state convictions, it is recommended that you contact the federal lawyer who represented you, the federal public defender, or the county public defender where you were convicted immediately.</p>

  <h2 class="subheading"><a id="Expung_Part5_CertificatesOfRehab"></a><a id="_Toc448153942"></a>Proposition 64: the New ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA Law</h2>
  
  <h3>WHAT IS PROP 64?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Prop 64, which became law on November 9, 2016, legalizes the personal possession of small amounts of marijuana for people 21 and over. Prop 64 also reduces the penalties for marijuana convictions. Under Prop 64, some offenses that used to be felonies are now misdemeanors. Some offenses that used to be misdemeanors are now infractions. This means that people with marijuana convictions might be eligible to have their convictions reduced or expunged.  Prop 64 also generally reduces penalties for people under the age of 21.</p>
  
  <h3>HOW Can PROP 64 HELP ME?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">If you are “currently serving a sentence” for an offense that Prop 64 reduced (see below), Prop 64 may let you be resentenced.</p>
  
  <p class="text">If you have a prior conviction for an offense Prop 64 reduced (see below), your prior might be redesignated (changed to a misdemeanor or infraction) or sealed.</p>
  
  <p class="text">If you have a current juvenile disposition or prior adjudication for an offense Prop 64 reduced, Prop 64 applies to you too, and you can ask for a new disposition, redesignation, or sealing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3048" id="footnote-ref-3048">[3012]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">If you are serving a sentence for a marijuana-related federal offense, reducing your conviction or sealing your record could impact your federal sentence and immigration consequences.</p>
  
  <p class="text">Resentencing, redesignation, or sealing could give you back your gun rights.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3049" id="footnote-ref-3049">[3013]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <h3>WHAT OFFENSES DOES PROP 64 REDUCE OR ELIMINATE?</h3>
  
  <p class="text"><em>It depends. </em>There are different penalties based on the amount of marijuana, the person’s age, and the person’s prior offenses. Here is a general summary.</p>

  <h3>WHAT MARIJUANA-RELATED OFFENSES HAVE NOT CHANGED UNDER PROP 64?   </h3>
  
  <p class="text">Marijuana offenses involving minors<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3071" id="footnote-ref-3071">[3035]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">Manufacturing concentrate by chemical extraction or synthesis<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3072" id="footnote-ref-3072">[3036]</a></sup></sup></p>

  <p class="text">Driving with marijuana<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3075" id="footnote-ref-3075">[3039]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">Marijuana offenses related to jails<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3076" id="footnote-ref-3076">[3040]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">(Note: There may be offenses not on this list, and Prop 64 added new infractions in Health and Safety Code sections 11362.3 and 11362.4)</p>
  
  <h3>CAN I BE RESENTENCED UNDER PROP 64? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">There are three requirements for resentencing. The court must resentence you unless the prosecution proves that you do not meet the requirements.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3077" id="footnote-ref-3077">[3041]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">1) You are “currently serving a sentence.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3078" id="footnote-ref-3078">[3042]</a></sup></sup> (There otherwise is no time limit.)</p>
  
  <p class="text">“Currently serving a sentence” is not defined in Prop 64.  It probably includes you if you:</p>
  
  <p class="text">Are serving time in prison, county jail, or a juvenile facility;</p>
  
  <p class="text">Are on parole or probation;</p>
  
  <p class="text">Are serving mandatory supervision under Penal Code section 1170(h); or</p>
  
  <p class="text">Are on parole or post-release community supervision<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3079" id="footnote-ref-3079">[3043]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">2) You “would not have been guilty of an offense, or [] would have been guilty of a lesser offense under [Prop 64] had the Act been in effect at the time of the offense . . . .”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3080" id="footnote-ref-3080">[3044]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">3) You do not pose an “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” </p>
  
  <p class="text"> “Unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” for Prop 64 means “an <em>unreasonable</em> risk the [you] will commit a new violent offense” from a list of among the most serious offenses found in Penal Code section 667(e)(2)(C)(iv).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3081" id="footnote-ref-3081">[3045]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">Note if You Have a Pending Appeal: You may be able to argue you should be resentenced without the court first deciding if you pose an “unreasonable risk.”  Prop 64 arguably applies retroactively to you because a statute reducing punishment typically applies to all cases pending on appeal under a case called <em>In re Estrada</em> (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3082" id="footnote-ref-3082">[3046]</a></sup></sup>  Consult with your appellate attorney about this argument.</p>
  
  <h3>CAN I GET A PRIOR MARIJUANA CONVICTION IN MY RECORD REDUCED OR REMOVED UNDER PROP 64?</h3>
  
  <p class="text"><em>Yes. </em>If you already have finished your sentence or juvenile disposition (including any supervision), then you can change convictions or adjudications on your record that now would be misdemeanors, infractions, or no offense under Prop 64. If they now would be misdemeanors or infractions, they can be redesignated”—reduced to—misdemeanors or infractions. If they now would be considered legal activities, they can be “sealed” or destroyed.</p>
  
  <p class="text">The requirements for redesignation or dismissal and sealing are: </p>
  
  <p class="text">You have finished your sentence or disposition</p>
  
  <p class="text">You “would not have been guilty of an offense, or [] would have been guilty of a lesser offense under the [Prop 64] had the Act been in effect at the time of the offense . . . .”</p>
  
  <p class="text">The law also lists convictions that may underlie a petition: Health and Safety Code sections 11357 (Possession), 11358 (Planting, harvesting, or processing), 11359 (possession for sale), or 11360 (Sale, transportation for sale, or gift).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3083" id="footnote-ref-3083">[3047]</a></sup></sup> An argument may exist that other convictions not listed as eligible for redesignation and sealing, but which would not be illegal under current law, can be redesignated or sealed.  <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3084" id="footnote-ref-3084">[3048]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">There is no “unreasonable risk” exception. There is no time limit.</p>
  
  <h3>WHAT DOES SEALING MEAN?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Prop 64 does not specify the meaning of sealing. Sealing will at least reach the court’s own records.  You also may want to ask the court for specific orders directing other agencies like police departments or prisons to also seal records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3085" id="footnote-ref-3085">[3049]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <h3>WHAT IF MY MARIJUANA CONVICTION WAS PART OF A PLEA AGREEMENT?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">You can be resentenced.  In fact, if you had a plea agreement, a judge cannot sentence you to more time or reinstate charges dismissed in a plea agreement.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3086" id="footnote-ref-3086">[3050]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <h3>WHAT MUST I DO TO GET RESENTENCED OR MY RECORD FIXED BECAUSE OF THE PROP 64 CHANGES?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">For resentencing, a “petition” to the sentencing court is required.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3087" id="footnote-ref-3087">[3051]</a></sup></sup>  For fixing your record, an “application” to the sentencing court is required.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3088" id="footnote-ref-3088">[3052]</a></sup></sup>  There is a form petition/application, available here: http://www.courts.ca.gov/prop64.htm. Contact the attorney who represented you or the county public defender’s office from where you were sentenced to file the petition or application for you.  If you have an ongoing appeal, also talk to your appellate attorney.   </p>
  
  <p class="text">Additionally, some records will be sealed automatically. State agencies must automatically destroy records of arrest and conviction from January 1, 1976 or later for possession of marijuana offenses under Health and Safety Code sections 11357 and 11360(b), plus juvenile adjudications for all marijuana-related offenses except those involving synthetic marijuana under Health and Safety Code section 11357.5. Agencies should destroy records two years after conviction or arrest if no conviction. Certain offenses including Health and Safety Code section 11357, subdivision (d) and other offenses on K-12 school grounds have special rules requiring destruction only upon a person turning 18.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3089" id="footnote-ref-3089">[3053]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">If you have certain offenses from before 1976, you can apply to destroy related records of arrests and convictions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3090" id="footnote-ref-3090">[3054]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <h3>WHAT PROP 64 DOES NOT DO?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Prop 64 does not specify a legal right to seek compensation for time spent in custody you could not have spent under the current law.</p>
  
  <h3>WHAT IF I ALREADY HAD MY CONVICTION EXPUNGED?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">You still should be eligible for Prop 64 relief that applies to you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3091" id="footnote-ref-3091">[3055]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <h3>IF I GET MY FELONY CONVICTION REDUCED UNDER PROP 64, CAN I THEN GET IT EXPUNGED?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Generally, if you have served time in prison for a felony conviction, you do not qualify for expungement. However, the law clearly says that offenses reduced to misdemeanors under Prop 64 should be treated as misdemeanors “for all purposes.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3092" id="footnote-ref-3092">[3056]</a></sup></sup>  This language should mean (and courts hopefully will decide it does mean) they will be misdemeanors for purposes of expungement under Penal Code section 1203.4a.  If you are in this situation, you should consult with an attorney for more information. You can contact the public defender’s office in the county where you were sentenced.</p>
  
  <h3>WHAT IF I HAVE A GUN POSSESSION CONVICTION, HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION 11370.2 ENHANCEMENT, OR OTHER OFFENSE/ ENHANCEMENT THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD WITHOUT MY FELONY MARIJUANA CONVICTION OR SENTENCE?  </h3>
  
  <p class="text">Depending on the circumstances, it might be possible to challenge other convictions/adjudications or sentences/dispositions affected by a marijuana conviction that gets sealed or redesignated under Prop 64. The California Supreme Court now is considering a similar question of whether a prior prison term enhancement (Pen. Code, § 667.5, subd. (b)) should be stricken where the underlying felony was changed to a misdemeanor under Prop 47.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3093" id="footnote-ref-3093">[3057]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <h3>DOES PROP 64 IMPACT MY FEDERAL SENTENCE?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Maybe. Even though Prop 64 only applies to state sentences, it still could help you if you are serving time for or at risk of deportation for a federal conviction.  </p>
  
  <p class="text">If your federal sentence was increased because you had a prior state conviction, sealing that conviction or reducing it to a misdemeanor could decrease the length of your sentence. </p>
  
  <p class="text">If you are serving a federal sentence and have a prior state conviction possibly affected by Proposition 64, contact the federal lawyer who represented you, the federal public defender, and/or the county public defender where you were convicted immediately for assistance.</p>
  
  <h3>DOES PROP 64 HELP WITH IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES? </h3>
  
  <p class="text"><em>Maybe.</em> First, under Prop 64, misdemeanor sentences cannot be longer than 364 days.  Therefore, if you are at risk of being deported because of a felony conviction and Prop 64 redesignates your conviction to a misdemeanor or infraction, this redesignation could have a significant impact for you.  In your petition or in court (if you have a hearing), it may help you to ask the court to note on the record the new maximum sentence.  </p>
  
  <p class="text">Second, because Prop 64 labels some relevant convictions “legally invalid,” you may be able to argue these “legally invalid” convictions should not affect immigration because they were “legal defects.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3094" id="footnote-ref-3094">[3058]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">Contact a lawyer immediately for help with this situation.  The Immigrant Post-Conviction Relief Project, run by the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights, offers free help to people with immigration issues related to their criminal convictions.  Contact the Lawyer’s Committee by phone at (415) 543-9444 or email at info@lccr.com.</p>

  <h4 class="sidebox">Am I eligible for a Certificate of rehabilitation if I am still on parole, probation, or PRCS?</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">NOT YET. BEFORE you can apply for a COR, you must have completed any term of probation, parole, or PRCS that was part of your sentence or a condition of your release.You will also have to complete a waiting period (which begins when you are released from custody) BEFORE you can apply for a COR. However, any time that you spend on parole, probation, or PRCS will count toward this period. For more information on when you can get a COR, see PG. 1186.</p>
  
  <p class="text">A Certificate of Rehabilitation (COR) is another way to clean up your criminal record. Although it does NOT remove anything from your record, it can restore certain rights that you may have lost, and can help improve your chances of success when you’re applying for work, housing, and professional or occupational licenses.</p>
  
  <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have a felony or misdemeanor sex conviction that is eligible for expungement (meaning you were not sent to prison), by law you must get the conviction expunged first, BEFORE you will be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (COR).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3095" id="footnote-ref-3095">[3059]</a></sup></strong></p>
