  <p>
    Am I eligible for the California LifeLine program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Eligibility for the California Lifeline phone program can be based on one of two different factors: (1) the low-income assistance programs (called program-based eligibility), OR (2) by meeting certain total household income limit requirements (called income-based eligibility). Go to http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=2752#qualify for a list of federal and state assistance (public benefits) programs that meet the program-based eligibility requirements, and for a chart that explains how much you can make to meet income-based eligibility requirements.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Only one LifeLine telephone line is allowed per “household.” For this program, a “household” member is defined as any adult (over 18 years old or an emancipated minor) living with you and sharing income and household expenses. Go to https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/household_worksheets/st_en_10_hh.pdf to view  a sample worksheet to help you figure out if you qualify as one “household.”
