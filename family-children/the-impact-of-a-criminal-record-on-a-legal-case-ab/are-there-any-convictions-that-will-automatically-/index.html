  <p>
    Are there any convictions that will automatically ban me from reconnecting with my child or grandchild?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. For some conviction offenses, the law will automatically ban you from reconnecting with a child/grandchild. And for some conviction offenses, a judge is unlikely to grant full custody or unsupervised visitation. See the chart that follows.

    HOW DIFFERENT CONVICTIONS WILL AFFECT YOUR CUSTODY & VISITATION RIGHTSCONVICTION OFFENSEHOW WILL THIS AFFECT MY CHANCES OF GETTING CUSTODY OR VISITATION?Domestic ViolenceJudges are hesitant to give custody to someone who has engaged in domestic violence, and will consider any history of domestic abuse against your child, the other parent, or a partner.[2233]RapeA judge will not allow someone who has been convicted of rape to have any custody or visitation with a child who was conceived from that rape.[2234]Other ConvictionsA judge usually will not grant custody or unsupervised visitation in the following circumstances, unless the s/he finds that there is no risk of harm to your child:If you have a conviction for certain child abuse offenses;[2235]If you have a conviction for first-degree murder of the child’s other parent; and/orIf you are a 290-sex offender registrant for an offense where the victim was a minor (under 18), or if you live with someone else who is a 290-sex offender registrant for an offense where the victim was a minor (under 18).[2236]
