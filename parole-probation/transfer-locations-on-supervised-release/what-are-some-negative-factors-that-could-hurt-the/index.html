          <h3><a id="_Toc448153030"></a>What are some <em>negative factors</em> that could hurt the chances of my request to move/ transfer from being approved?</h3>
          <p class="text">Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. </p>
          <p class="text">The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:</p>
          <ol class="text">No job offer in new area;</ol>
          <ol class="text">No or weak family and community ties in the new area;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);</ol>
          <ol class="text">You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;</ol>
          <ol class="text">The new address where you want to move is unsafe;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">The residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.</ol>
