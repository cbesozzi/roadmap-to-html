          <h1>What is juvenile dependency court?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153623"></a>What is juvenile dependency court?</h3>
          <p class="sidebox">How is <em>juvenile dependency court</em> different from <em>juvenile delinquency court</em>?Juvenile delinquency courts are for cases where a child is charged with committing a crime. Juvenile dependency courts, on the other hand, are for cases where a parent or caregiver is suspected of abusing or neglecting a child. Sometimes, children are involved in both of these courts at the same time—if they are <em>both </em>being charge with a crime <em>and</em> there is a case of suspected child abuse or neglect by their parents. If your child is being charged with a crime, see the next section on juvenile delinquency on PG. 945.</p>
          <p class="text">The local county Child Protective Services (CPS) opens a case in juvenile dependency court when a child’s parent(s) or caregivers are suspected of <em>abuse </em>or<em> neglect</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2368" id="footnote-ref-2368">[2336]</a></sup> </p>
          <h5 class="question">When would CPS get involved?</h5>
          <p class="text">CPS gets involved in a child’s life when a parent has been violent with, abused, or neglected a child, or if the child tests positive for drugs at birth.<sup><a href="#footnote-2369" id="footnote-ref-2369">[2337]</a></sup> When CPS gets involved, they may open a case in juvenile dependency court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2370" id="footnote-ref-2370">[2338]</a></sup> Whether or not they open a case in dependency court depends on if CPS removed the child from his or her home. Once CPS removes the child, a case is started in juvenile dependency court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2371" id="footnote-ref-2371">[2339]</a></sup> In most cases, the parent(s) will have the opportunity to get their child back if they meet certain requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-2372" id="footnote-ref-2372">[2340]</a></sup></p>
          <h5 class="question">What is considered child abuse?</h5>
          <p class="text">Under the law, abuse may be physical harm, sexual abuse, cruel or unreasonable punishment, using drugs while pregnant, and/or neglect of a child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2373" id="footnote-ref-2373">[2341]</a></sup></p>
          <h5 class="question"><a id="_Toc302383998"></a><a id="_Toc304119089"></a><a id="_Toc312427116"></a><a id="_Toc314389728"></a>Can CPS remove my child from my care just because I have a criminal record?</h5>
          <p class="text">No. Just having a criminal record is not enough for Child Protective Services (CPS) or a judge to take your child away—there has to be some connection between your conviction and a risk of harm to your child. For example, a conviction for child abuse, certain violent felonies, or using drug or alcohol in a way that put your child at risk could cause CPS or the judge to remove your child from your care.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2374" id="footnote-ref-2374">[2342]</a></sup></sup> </p>
