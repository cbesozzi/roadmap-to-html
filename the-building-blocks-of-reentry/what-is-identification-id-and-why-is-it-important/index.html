          <h3><a id="_Toc328831218"></a>What is identification (ID) and why is it important?</h3>
          <p class="text">Identification (“ID”) is proof of who you are —your <em>identity</em>. Government agencies, workplaces, service providers, schools, and other institutions issue ID cards for people who are members. Many forms of ID include a photo and important information about you, such as your address or physical characteristics. Having an ID is important because, when you sign up for various programs, licenses, and services, you’ll have to show an ID to prove that you are who you say you are, and to show that you qualify for whatever you’re signing up for. </p>
