  <h4 class="sidebox">How CAN I show Proof of homelessness</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">For proof of homelessness, most housing providers will just need a signed statement. If the housing provider asks for further documentation, you may need to show eviction papers, a letter from a social worker, etc. Some organizations will also issue certificates of homelessness, for example:Coalition on Homelessness<br/>488 Turk Street<br/>San Francisco, CA 94102<br/>Phone: (415) 346-3740<br/><em>Certificates of Homelessness are issued Mondays and Wednesdays 10 a.m.–12 p.m.</em></p>
  
  <p class="answer"><em>It depends on the program. </em>Unfortunately, most post-release transitional housing programs will not let you fill out an application or get on the waitlist before your release. A few let you apply from inside prison or jail, but may have other requirements or restrictions. Go to APPENDIX B on PG. 467 for a partial list of transitional housing options in California that <em>may</em> accept residents who write to them from inside prison or jail.BUT NOTE: In recent years, the CDCR has introduced several pre-release transitional housing programs designed to let people to carry out the last part of their sentence in a controlled community setting.These are <em>alternatives</em> to traditional incarceration that typically provide for greater freedom. Participants remain under the CDCR’s jurisdiction and control and are NOT on parole or other post-release supervision. In that sense, these programs are very different from the posts-release housing options discussed here. For more information on CDCR-sponsored pre-release programs see page [].</p>
