  Getting Off Informal Probation
</p>

<p>
  Can I get off informal probation early? 
</p>

<p>
  Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from your informal probation term.[605] Some people are able to satisfy all of the conditions of their probation (all of the things the court orders you to do, such as attend counseling or pay restitution) before their probation term is up. For this reason, judges are often willing to release people from probation early.[606] The process is the same for asking a court to terminate your informal probation, formal probation, or mandatory supervision early. If the judge grants your request (called a “motion”) to end your informal probation early, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record! For more information on how to file a Motion for Early Termination of Probation, and how to request a dismissal of your eligible convictions, please see the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132.
