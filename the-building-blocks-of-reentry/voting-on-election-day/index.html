  Voting on Election Day
</p>

<p>
  I AM registered to vote. Where, when, and how do I vote in the next election? 
</p>

<p>
  In California, you can vote in two ways: (1) by mail ballot, or (2) at your local county polling place. 
</p>

<p>
  Voting by Mail — If you’re already registered to vote at your current home address, contact your county elections office to request a vote-by-mail ballot application form (see PG. 85 to learn how to find the nearest county elections office).[272] Once you get this form in the mail, complete and return it to the county elections office at least 7 days before the election. 
</p>

<p>
  Voting in Person — Once you’re registered, you’ll get a sample ballot in the mail (which you don't need to fill out — it’s just supposed to help to prepare you for election day). Your voting location (called a “polling place”) is listed on this ballot. You can also call your county elections office[273] to ask about your voting location. On election day, go to this location to vote. All polls should be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
</p>

<p>
  When is election day? 
</p>

<p>
  The General Election is on the first Tuesday of November.[274] 
</p>

<p>
  Can I get time off from work to vote in California? 
</p>

<p>
  Yes. If you don’t have enough time outside of work to vote, you have to right to take time off from work to vote — up to 2 hours, which must be paid time off. You need to tell your employer at least 2 working days in advance, and you can only take the time off at the start or end of your workday, unless you have made a different agreement with your boss.[275] If you are a part-time or temporary employee, then these rules apply to you IF you are hired to work for more than 52 hours over the course of 90 calendar days.[276] If you are an independent contractor, you are not considered an employee by law, so these rules do NOT apply to you — you do NOT have the right to paid time off to vote.[277] However, even if you aren’t entitled to paid time off, you are still entitled to take a reasonable time off to vote, because federal law prohibits interfering with citizens’ right to vote.[278]
</p>

<p>
  I have a physical disability. Can I get help getting access to my voting location? 
</p>

<p>
  Yes. Follow these two steps:
</p>

<p>
  STEP 1: First, contact your county elections office to find out if your voting location (“polling place”) is accessible to you, given your disability. 
</p>

<p>
  STEP 2: Second, if your voting location isn’t accessible to you, curbside voting should be available. With curbside voting, you will be asked to get as close to the voting area as you can, and elections officials will bring you a sign-in sheet, ballot, and any other voting materials you need.[279]
