  <p>
    Who has to pay child support?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A court can only order you to pay child support if you are legally considered to be the child’s mother or father.[2437] You have to pay child support when a family court judge makes a child support order, which says how much each parent is required to pay. A family court judge can make a child support order in any of the following cases (please note: EITHER parent can ask the judge for a child support order in any of the following cases):[2438]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Divorce, legal separation, or annulment—for parents who are married to each other and want to end their relationship;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Paternity (parentage)—for parents who are NOT married to each other;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Petition for Custody and Support of Minor Children—for parents who have signed a voluntary Declaration of Paternity, OR who are married and want to stay married; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Domestic violence restraining order—for married OR unmarried parents; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In some situations, the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) may also start a child support case in court against one or both parents/caregivers (see next question for more information about LCSA child support cases).[2439]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In general, you must continue to make child support payments until your child turns 18 years old,[2440] or until the judge or LCSA agrees to change the order. Child support also ends if your parental rights are terminated.[2441]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do legal guardians have to pay child support?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No.[2442] Child support is a parental responsibility, not a legal guardian’s responsibility, and therefore a judge cannot order a legal guardian to pay child support.[2443] But adoptive parents DO take on a legal financial responsibility to support their adoptive child(ren)—because they assume all legal rights and responsibilities of biological parents (unlike legal guardians).[2444]
