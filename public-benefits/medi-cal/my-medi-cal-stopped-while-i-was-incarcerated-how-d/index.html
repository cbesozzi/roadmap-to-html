          <h3><a id="_Toc290125904"></a><a id="_Toc448153318"></a>My Medi-Cal stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart it?</h3>
          <p class="text">It depends on when you first became incarcerated, and when your release date is/was. California law on this has recently changed, and different rules started to apply on January 1, 2014.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1501" id="footnote-ref-1501">[1471]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">The old rule. If you were incarcerated before January 1, 2014:<em> </em>If you were on Medi-Cal prior to your incarceration, then your Medi-Cal was ended on the day that you entered jail or prison. This means if you wanted to get Medi-Cal again, you had to reapply, get approved, and wait until your release before you could receive health care coverage through Medi-Cal. </p>
          <p class="text">The new rule. If you were incarcerated anytime after January 1, 2014: If you were on Medi-Cal prior to your incarceration, then your Medi-Cal got automatically suspended (paused) on the day that you entered jail or prison. The suspension period is set to last 1 year. This means that:</p>
          <ol class="text">If you’re released before 1 year passes, AND you continue to meet all other eligibility requirements, your Medi-Cal should automatically restart on the day of your release (and you don’t need to reapply).<sup><a href="#footnote-1502" id="footnote-ref-1502">[1472]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If you’re still incarcerated after 1 year passes, then your Medi-Cal coverage will end—and if you want to get Medi-Cal again, you’ll need to reapply to restart your coverage after your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-1503" id="footnote-ref-1503">[1473]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text">If you qualified for Medi-Cal through SSI, you may need to restart your SSI benefits (see PG. 615) before you can get your Medi-Cal coverage back.<sup><a href="#footnote-1504" id="footnote-ref-1504">[1474]</a></sup></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125905"></a><a id="_Toc448153319"></a>I believe my Medi-Cal was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? </h3>
          <p class="text">If and when the Medi-Cal office decides to suspend or end your Medi-Cal coverage, it must send you a “Notice of Action” explaining this decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-1505" id="footnote-ref-1505">[1475]</a></sup> If you disagree with the decision and want to appeal (challenge) it, read the back of the Notice for instructions about how to request a hearing. </p>
          <p class="text">In general, you’ll need to contact the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) State Hearings Division:</p>
