  <h1>If I try to sue the employer in court, what must I prove?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="EM_Sue_ReasonableAccomodations"></a><a id="_Toc448153493"></a>If I try to sue the employer in court, what must I prove?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">To sue an employer under the federal ADA (FHA), California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act),<sup><a href="#footnote-1977" id="footnote-ref-1977">[1947]</a></sup> you must show that your status as an individual with a disability was a motivating factor in the employer’s decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.<sup><a href="#footnote-1978" id="footnote-ref-1978">[1948]</a></sup> You must also provide evidence that your disability substantially limited your ability to live a normal life,<sup><a href="#footnote-1979" id="footnote-ref-1979">[1949]</a></sup> that the requested accommodation is reasonable and necessary, and (for a disability related to substance abuse) that you are not currently using illegal drugs.<sup> </sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1980" id="footnote-ref-1980">[1950]</a></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">Remember, you CANNOT sue an employer in court until AFTER you’ve filed a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH and received a Right-to-Sue notice.</p>
  
  <p class="text">NOTE: You should be prepared for the employer to argue that you do NOT have a protected disability because you are a “current user” of illegal drugs, or that you are not being treated for your mental illness.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1981" id="footnote-ref-1981">[1951]</a></sup></sup> You can support your request by providing treatment records showing that you have not used drugs for a significant period of time, or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1982" id="footnote-ref-1982">[1952]</a></sup></sup> You should also provide evidence of your participation in or completion of a drug abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness.</p>
