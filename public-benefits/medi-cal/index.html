<h1>Medi-Cal</h1>

<p>
  Medi-Cal
</p>

<p>
  Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid program, offering free or low-cost health care coverage for low-income California residents.[1448] You can apply as an individual or as a family. Due to recent changes in the law, California has expanded the Medi-Cal program. Thus, if you applied for Medi-Cal prior to January 1, 2014 and were denied, you may still be eligible under the new rules.[1449]
</p>

<p>
  INFO ON INCOME LIMITS
</p>

<p>
  The limit is defined as 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The FPL varies based on family size, and it changes from year to year. Because the income limit changes, each year, ask your county welfare agency for exact numbers when you’re ready to apply. To determine whether you qualify for Medi-Cal benefits, based on your income, visit: http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/Pages/DoYouQualifyForMedi-Cal.aspx. To download and print the income limit, visit: https://www.coveredca.com/PDFs/paper_application/CA-SingleStreamApp_92MAX.pdf. 
</p>

<p>
  Am I eligible for Medi-Cal? 
</p>

<p>
  If you live in California, you can qualify for full Medi-Cal coverage in a few different ways:
</p>

<p>
  First: You may be eligible for Medi-Cal if:
</p>

<p>
  You’re a California resident or you’re lawfully present in the U.S.,[1450] and 
</p>

<p>
  You have limited income.[1451] 
</p>

<p>
  Second: You may be automatically eligible for Medi-Cal if you (1) meet the income requirements, and (2) fall into one of these special categories:
</p>

<p>
  Adults age 65 and older
</p>

<p>
  Blind or disabled individuals
</p>

<p>
  Children under age 21
</p>

<p>
  Pregnant women
</p>

<p>
  Women diagnosed with breast and/or cervical cancer
</p>

<p>
  Parents or caretakers of disadvantaged children under 21
</p>

<p>
  Residents in skilled nursing or intermediate care homes
</p>

<p>
  Individuals enrolled in certain other public benefits programs, including CalWORKs, SSI/SSP, Refugee Assistance Program, In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS), Foster Care or Adoption Assistance Program.[1452]
</p>

<p>
  To find out if you’re eligible for full or partial health care coverage through Medi-Cal, contact your county welfare agency. For a statewide directory of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A, on PG. 634. You may also seek to apply using a paper application.[1453]
