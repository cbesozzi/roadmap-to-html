          <h3><a id="_Toc290125896"></a><a id="_Toc352861563"></a>Am I legally required to enroll in health care coverage?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you live in the U.S., and you’re <em>not currently incarcerated</em>, the answer is probably <em>yes</em>. <a id="PB_HealthCare_IndividualMandate"></a>Certain people in special situations (explained below) are excused from this requirement. Unless you have one of these situations, you MUST enroll in health care coverage, or else you must pay a penalty fee when you file taxes.<sup><a href="#footnote-1510" id="footnote-ref-1510">[1509]</a></sup> This legal requirement is called the “individual mandate,” and the tax penalty is called the “shared responsibility fee.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1511" id="footnote-ref-1511">[1510]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><a id="PublicBenefits_HealthCare_ExceptionManda"></a><strong><em>Exemptions to the Individual Mandate:</em></strong> If you qualify for an exemption, you don’t have to pay a penalty even if you don’t have health care coverage. You may qualify for an exemption if one of the following situations applies to you:<sup><a href="#footnote-1512" id="footnote-ref-1512">[1511]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Currently incarcerated:</span> You’re currently in jail or prison serving a sentence for a conviction. This doesn’t include being held for a case that’s still pending—for example, you’ve been charged but not yet convicted.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Short coverage gap:</span> Your uninsured period is shorter than 3 months (back-to-back) during the year.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Not lawfully present:</span> You don’t have citizenship or lawful immigrant status in the U.S.<sup><a href="#footnote-1513" id="footnote-ref-1513">[1512]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Not required to file taxes:</span> You’re not legally required to file a tax return because your income is too low.<sup><a href="#footnote-1514" id="footnote-ref-1514">[1513]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Unable to afford coverage:</span> You can’t afford the cheapest coverage available to you, because it would cost more than 8% of your household income.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Indian tribe:</span> You belong to a federally recognized Indian tribe, or you’re eligible for services through an Indian Health Services provider.<sup><a href="#footnote-1515" id="footnote-ref-1515">[1514]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Sharing ministry:</span> You’re a member of a recognized health care sharing ministry.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Religious conscience:</span> You’re a member of a recognized religious sect with religious objections to insurance, including Social Security and Medicare.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Hardship:</span> You’ve had financial or domestic difficulties that kept you from enrolling in health care, such as homelessness, a death in the family, bankruptcy, a medical emergency, or a natural disaster. Filing for a hardship requires you to fill out special forms. </ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">A Note About Individual Mandate Exemptions</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Even if you qualify for an exemption, you still can apply and get health care coverage to help pay for medical expenses. An exemption just means that you don’t have to pay the penalty fee—called the “shared responsibility fee”—if you one of the exemption situations applies to you, and you don’t get health care coverage.</p>
          <p class="text">For most of these situations, you must apply to get an exemption. The process varies by situation. </p>
          <p class="text">If you have questions about the forms you need, or if you aren’t sure how to get an exemption for your situation, call Covered California at 1-800-300-1506 (TTY 1-888-889-4500) or the federal government’s Health Insurance Marketplace at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY 1-855-889-4325). Or you may try calling Health Consumer Alliance (HCA), a non-profit organization dedicated to providing information about and helping Californians to get health care.

          <h4 class="textbox">YOU DON’T need to APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION IF…</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">You have a short coverage gap;If you are not required to file taxes because your income is too low;If you are not lawfully present;You are currently incarcerated (But note: Once you’re released, the individual mandate will apply to you, so you’ll need to get health coverage at that time. See PG. 457 for more information.)</ul>
