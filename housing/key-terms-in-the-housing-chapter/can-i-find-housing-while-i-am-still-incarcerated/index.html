        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL TIPS<br/>as you look for housing</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS as a person with a criminal record <em>before</em> you apply for housing! Depending on who owns and runs the housing (private vs. government-assisted—see PG. 394), you will have different rights in the process.IT’S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO FIND HELP, if you can. Find an attorney, advocate, case manager, friend or family member, or probation/parole officer who can help you find housing. It is very important to have support in this process and throughout reentry. There is a list of helpful community resources in the back of this guide on PG. 1296 if you want ideas about where to look for help.FINDING HOUSING IS TOUGH BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE—be patient and keep looking!SOME OF YOUR OPTIONS. Depending on whether you are currently incarcerated or already out, affordability, eligibility, and whether you are looking for short-term or long-term housing, you will have different types of housing options available to you. As you move further into your reentry, these options are likely to change over time.</ul>
        <h4 class="sidebox">STAY POSITIVE!</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Finding housing can be an exhausting process, but don’t give up. Reach out for help. There are resources listed throughout this chapter, and also a list of legal services providers on PG. 1286.Call us at Root &amp; Rebound (510-279-4662) if you have an emergency, and we may be able to refer you someone to help.</p>
        <p class="text">Yes, it is possible. First, you may want to think about (1) what you need in the short-term vs. long-term; (2) how your parole or probation (or other type of supervision) affects where you can live; and (3) whether you want to look for private housing, government-assisted housing, or both. To help with this process, read about<em> your housing options</em>, starting on PG. 377.</p>
        <p class="text">There are additional considerations if you plan to move in with family or friends. You will want to ask them to find out everything possible about the guest policies where they live, and/or about adding someone to their apartment lease. If the housing your family or friend lives in receives <em>any form of government assistance</em>, they may also need to contact their local Public Housing Authority (PHA) to let them know they would like to add you to the household. A list of PHAs in California and their contact information can be found here: APPENDIX A, PG. 461 or online here: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/states/ca.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/states/ca.cfm</a>. Learn more about moving in with family and friends beginning on PG. 436.</p>
        <p class="text">If you want to find transitional or emergency housing, generally you or a family member, friend or advocate will have to directly write or call the housing facility to ask about what the requirements are. For a list of transitional housing programs that may accept you while you are still incarcerated, see APPENDIX B, PG. 467.</p>
