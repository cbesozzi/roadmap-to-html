  <p>
    who has to pay spousal support?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you and your spouse or partner either get a court-order for spousal support or you agree to a payment plan on your own, the spouse or partner that is the higher wage earner will have to pay the lesser-earning spouse or partner an adequate amount of money to help pay for the less his/her basic living expenses.[2497]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How will owing spousal support affect my reentry? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Owing spousal support can affect your credit score, your ability to get some types of employment, your income, and more. For example:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your Credit Score Can Be Affected: If a Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) is involved they will report your support non-payment to credit rating agencies. They are also entitled to use all the enforcement mechanisms that they use for child support non-payments.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your Employment and Income Can Be Affected: If the person receiving spousal supports files for wage garnishment, your employer may be forced to withhold part of your wages to pay back your past due spousal support.
