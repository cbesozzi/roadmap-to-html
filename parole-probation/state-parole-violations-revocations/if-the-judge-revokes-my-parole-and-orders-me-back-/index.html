          <h1>If the judge revokes my parole and orders me back into custody, where will I serve and for how long?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152851"></a>If the judge revokes my parole and orders me back into custody, where will I serve and for how long?</h3>
          <p class="text">It depends on your conviction history.</p>
          <p class="text">(1) MOST PEOPLE – Almost everyone who has his or her parole revoked will serve the parole revocation sentence in county jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-603" id="footnote-ref-603">[578]</a></sup> You will most likely get 180 days in county jail, even if there were multiple grounds for the revocation.<sup><a href="#footnote-604" id="footnote-ref-604">[579]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">You can earn “half-time” credit on parole revocation sentences (meaning 2 days “good conduct credit” for every 2 days actually served in custody), regardless of the nature of the commitment offense or parole violation. If you are serving a parole revocation sentence and you violate jail rules or refuse to do assigned work, then you may lose some or all of your good conduct credits.<sup><a href="#footnote-605" id="footnote-ref-605">[580]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">(2) FORMER “LIFER” –There are different rules if you are on parole after serving an indeterminate prison term of “life with the possibility of parole” (a.k.a. “former lifers”). If you are a former lifer:</p>
          <ol class="text">You can get a parole revocation sentence term of up to 12 months;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You are not entitled to earn good conduct credits; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your revocation sentence could be extended if you violate rules while you are in custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-606" id="footnote-ref-606">[581]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text">(3) CERTAIN SEX OR MURDER CONVICTIONS – There are also different rules for people convicted of certain sex offenses or certain murder convictions:<sup><a href="#footnote-607" id="footnote-ref-607">[582]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">If you have life-long parole (some people convicted of sex offenses or murder) and it gets revoked, you’ll be sent back to prison, not county jail.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-608" id="footnote-ref-608">[583]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Within 1 year of being returned to prison, a two-member BPH panel will hold a hearing. The panel must release you within 1 year of the date of the revocation—unless it determines the seriousness of the parole violation requires longer incarceration for public safety. If the two-member BPH panel keeps you in prison longer than 1 year, you have the legal right to a parole consideration hearing every year afterwards.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-609" id="footnote-ref-609">[584]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152852"></a>What rights do I have if I am a person with a disability going through parole revocation proceedings? </h3>
          <p>Under a federal law called the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you have the legal right to reasonable accommodations during parole violation/revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-610" id="footnote-ref-610">[585]</a></sup> Examples of accommodations could include:</p>
          <ol class="text">Ensuring access to the hearing room for a parolee with mobility impairments;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Providing Braille, taped documents, or reading assistance for a vision-impaired parolee;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Providing assistance in communicating for a developmentally disabled parolee; OR</ol>
          <ol class="text">Providing sign language interpretation for a hearing-impaired parolee.<sup><a href="#footnote-611" id="footnote-ref-611">[586]</a></sup></ol>
          <p>Just like all other aspects of parole, the CDCR’s parole staff must use “effective communication” and provide reasonable accommodations when interacting with you. That means that they must use effective communication and provide reasonable accommodations when:</p>
          <ol class="text">Arresting you;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Modifying your conditions of parole; or </ol>
          <ol class="text">Imposing sanctions like flash incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-612" id="footnote-ref-612">[587]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text"><em>KEEP IN MIND: </em>If you are a disabled parolee who is having problems receiving help from parole staff, you can submit a CDCR Form 1824, “Request for Modification or Reasonable Accommodation,” (read more about this process on PG. 199 above). CDCR parole staff should also alert jail staff and the attorney appointed to you about what your needs are when revocation proceedings begin.<sup><a href="#footnote-613" id="footnote-ref-613">[588]</a></sup></p>
