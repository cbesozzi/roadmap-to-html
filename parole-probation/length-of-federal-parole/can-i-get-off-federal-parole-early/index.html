  <p>
    Can I get off federal parole early?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possibly. Read about when and how you can ask to be released from federal parole early.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every year, your U.S. Probation Officer submits a report to the Parole Commission about your adjustment in the community. After reviewing the report and any recommendations it contains, the Parole Commission may decide to end your parole supervision early.[911] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At any point in time, you may request, or the Parole Commission on its own motion may decide, to end your parole supervision early.[912]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After you’ve completed 2 years on federal parole (again: not counting any time you spend on parole before the most recent release, and not counting any time you spent in confinement on another sentence[913]), the Parole Commission must consider terminating your federal parole, and again must consider early termination at a minimum every year thereafter.[914]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After you’ve completed 5 years on federal parole (again: not counting any time spend on parole before the most recent release, and not counting any time you spent in confinement on another sentence), by law, the Parole Commission must end your supervision UNLESS it finds—after conducting a hearing with you present—that you are likely to engage in future conduct violating criminal law. You have the right to a personal hearing before the Parole Commission can make such a finding to keep you on federal parole past 5 years.[915] You should not waive your right to this hearing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is a “GOOD RISK DETERMINATION”?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is VERY difficult to have a “very good risk” determination for the SFS. This is because the score sheet is written to be nearly impossible for someone to every have that good of a score. To have a VG (Very Good) you have to have 10 -8 SFS, which is very hard given that you lose a point just for being on parole. The scorecard is very “stacked” against the parolee. not.
