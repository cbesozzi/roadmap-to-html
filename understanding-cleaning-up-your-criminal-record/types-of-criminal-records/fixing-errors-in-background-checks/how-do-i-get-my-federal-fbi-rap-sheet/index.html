          <h3><a id="_Toc448153899"></a>How do I get my federal (FBI) RAP sheet?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you have ever been arrested or had a conviction in another state, or for a federal offense, you will want to get a copy of your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your “Identity History Summary.” </p>
          <p class="text">There are two ways to get a copy of your FBI RAP sheet:</p>
          <ol class="text">You can request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI; OR</ol>
          <ol class="text">You can use a special private company, called a “Channeler,” that has contracted with the FBI to perform this service.</ol>
          <p class="text">NOTE: It is generally faster to go through an FBI Channeler, but it is likely to be more expensive because these companies usually charge extra fees.</p>
          <p class="text">Whether you request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI or go through a channeler, you will need to fill out the FBI’s “Applicant Information Form” and get fingerprinted by a Live Scan service provider. For a step-by-step explanation of how to get your FBI RAP sheet, see APPENDIX D, on PG. 1215. </p>
          <p class="text">For more information about getting your RAP directly from the FBI, visit the FBI’s website at: <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/faqs">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/faqs</a></p>
