<p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h4 class="textbox">What will I learn? </h4>

<ul class="learn-bullets">A basic overview of your educational optionsWhat you need to get started in pursuing your education</ul>

<p class="text">Getting an education is one of the most important steps you can take in re-entry if it feels right to you. Education can open doors, create opportunities, and lead to better and more stable employment. </p>

<p class="text">This Chapter is a roadmap to help you start (or continue) planning so that you can reach your educational goals. It discusses what programs, schools, and financial aid opportunities are available, and it takes you through the process of deciding what is right for you. The advice here is intended to be practical both for people who are currently incarcerated, as well as for people who were formerly incarcerated and have returned to the community.</p>

<p class="text"><em>NOTE FOR READERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED: </em>Throughout this guide, we will often suggest that you “call” the resource that you need. We understand that it might not be possible for you to make these phone calls yourself while you are incarcerated, however we offer it as general information for you, your family, and your advocates to use for your benefit.</p>

<h4 class="textbox">DID YOU KNOW? </h4>

<p class="textbox">Studies show that formerly incarcerated people who receive general education or vocational training are much less likely to return to prison and much more likely to find employment after their release. In fact, people who participate in correctional education programs while incarcerated have a 43 percent <em>lower</em> chance of returning to prison, and a 13 percent <em>higher</em> chance of finding employment, than people who do not do educational programs while incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2614" id="footnote-ref-2614">[2582]</a></sup> </p>
