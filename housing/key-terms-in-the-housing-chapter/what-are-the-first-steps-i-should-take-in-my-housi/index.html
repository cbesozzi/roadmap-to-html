          <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
          <ul class="learn-bullets">Some short-term options for housingSome long-term options for housingThe difference between <em>privately run</em> &amp; <em>government-assisted</em> housingRecommendations for finding government-assisted housingRecommendations for finding housing for people with special needs, such as women and children, domestic violence survivors, seniors, veterans, people recovering from addiction, and 290 sex offender registrantsYour rights—and how they are different—if you are applying to privately run vs. government-assisted housing Your rights if you want to move in with friends and familyHow conditions of parole, probation, or other forms of supervision can affect where you can live and who you can live with after releaseHow to challenge denials from housing—whether it’s private or government-assisted—based on your criminal record</ul>
          <p class="text"><a id="Housing_options_main"></a><em>Here are the main types of housing you may consider after getting out of prison or jail: </em></p>
          <ol class="text">Short-term housing (staying short-term with a family member or friend, staying in transitional housing, staying in a shelter or other emergency housing)</ol>
          <ol class="text">Long-term permanent housing (finding an apartment, moving in with family or friends permanently)</ol>
          <ol class="text">Special needs housing (which could be short- or long-term)</ol>
          <ol class="text">Government-assisted housing</ol>
          <ol class="text">Below we walk through some steps to help you figure out your housing plans.</ol>
          <h4 class="step">SHORT-TERM HOUSING PLANS: </h4>
          <p class="text">First, you should figure out what type of housing is right for you in the short term, and where you will be allowed to live by probation or parole (or which ever type of supervision you are on) when you first get out. See the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 145 to learn about how your rules (called “conditions”) of supervision affect where you can live after release. There is more information about different types of short-term housing beginning on PG. 381.</p>
          <h4 class="step">GET YOUR ID. </h4>
          <p class="text">Most housing programs will require proof of who you are, your age, and any income you receive. (Go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21, to learn how to get various forms of identification documents.)</p>
          <h4 class="step">LONG-TERM HOUSING PLANS </h4>
          <p class="text">Later on, you can figure out what type of housing is right for you permanently—we call this “long-term housing.” You need to find housing that you can <em>afford</em>, that you <em>are eligible for</em> (meaning you meet the requirements to be accepted), and that <em>meets your personal needs</em>.</p>
          <p class="text">Long-term, permanent housing might mean living with family or friends; living in an affordable apartment or housing unit run by a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or a private landlord; or living in an assisted-living facility for people with special needs (like seniors, veterans, women and children, people with disabilities, or people escaping domestic violence, 290 sex offender registrants). There is more information about different types of short-term housing beginning on PG. 381. For more information For more information on housing for special needs, see PG. 385. </p>
