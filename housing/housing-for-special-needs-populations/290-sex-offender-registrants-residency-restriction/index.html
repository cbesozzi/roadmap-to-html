        <p class="text">Recently, there have been some important changes in the law governing residency restriction for 290 sex offender registrants. Up until March 2015, as a result of Proposition 83 (“Jessica’s Law”), there were strict residency restrictions on people who were required to register as sex offenders under California Penal Code Section 290. If this law applied to you, you could not reside <em>within 2,000 feet</em> of any school or park where children regularly gather.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1121" id="footnote-ref-1121">[1095]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
        <p class="text">In March 2015, the California Supreme Court declared that the blanket residency restriction for all sex offenders required to register under California Penal Code Section 290 is illegal. Now CDCR can place special restrictions on registered sex offenders in the form of discretionary (decided specifically for you) parole conditions. These conditions can require more or less than Jessica’s law, but they must be based on facts surrounding each individual parolee’s case.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1122" id="footnote-ref-1122">[1096]</a></sup></sup></span> The CDCR may also be able to impose other residency restrictions as special conditions of parole in individual cases based on specific case factors.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1123" id="footnote-ref-1123">[1097]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS TO KNOW For people convicted of sex offenses:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">“DISTANCE” is measured by a straight line between the main entrance of the residence and the boundary of the nearest park or school, not the driving or walking distance. 15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3571(e)(4). “RESIDENCE” is any place where:</p>
        <ul class="sidebox">You spend 1 day or night at the same address every week for multiple consecutive weeks; You spend 2 or more days or nights in a row living at the same address; You have a key to the address “and there is a pattern of residency”; orThe parole agent finds evidence of your residency such your clothes or toiletries. 15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3590(a).</ul>
        <p class="text">There is more information about 290 registrants in the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER of this guide. Go to PG. 182 to learn more.</p>
