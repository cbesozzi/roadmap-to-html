  <h3><a id="_Toc448153148"></a>How can I find out the criminal record policies of my local Public Housing Authority (PHA) or of the owner of government-assisted housing?</h3>
  
  <p class="textbox">REMEMBER THAT THESE “CATCH-ALL” BANS ARE NOT REQUIRED: <br/>This “catch-all” category is NOT a required ban. The PHA or owner is allowed to exclude you only if they can show that your criminal history poses a current threat to the health, safety, or peace of other residents, the owner, or PHA staff or agents/contractors. It’s recommended that they consider mitigating information and proof of your rehabilitation—and in the case of the Public Housing program, the PHA MUST consider such additional information!</p>
  
  <p class="text">Each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing will have different rules about what criminal history information they will ignore and what they will consider. By law, the PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST put their policies <em>in writing</em> and make them available to applicants.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1166" id="footnote-ref-1166">[1136]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">The rules and policies of each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing MUST not violate the legal protections discussed on PG. 428. Furthermore, the PHA must follow its own rules and policies. </p>
  
  <p class="text">You may want to consider talking to an advocate/lawyer about whether or not a particular PHA’s policies to exclude people with certain criminal records could be violating the law. (See PG. 1286 for a list of legal aid providers across California).</p>
  
  <p class="importantbox"> IMPORTANT: Want to learn how to challenge a denial from a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing? Go to PG. 408 to learn more! </p>
