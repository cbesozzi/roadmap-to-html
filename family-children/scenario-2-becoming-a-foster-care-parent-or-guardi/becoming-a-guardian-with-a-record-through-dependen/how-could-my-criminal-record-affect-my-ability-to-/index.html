  <p>
    How could my criminal record affect my ability to be appointed as the child’s guardian in dependency court?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, the bad news: If the child is NOT living with you right now, before the judge can make you the child’s guardian and allow the child to live with you, the court staff (or a county social worker) must run a background check on you AND any other adults who live in your home or who will spend significant time with the child.[2382] If you (or any other adult who gets checked) have a criminal record, the judge will not allow the child to live with you UNLESS you get a “criminal record exemption” from the county social service agency.[2383] A criminal record exemption means you must get the county social service agency to excuse your conviction and not hold it against you in the process of becoming the child’s guardian through dependency court.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What convictions can I NOT get an “exemption” for?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unfortunately, many convictions are considered “non-exemptible,” which means if you or anyone in your home has a non-exemptible conviction on your criminal record, the judge will NOT allow the child to live with you, even if living with you would otherwise be good for the child.[2384] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Non-exemptible convictions include: A FELONY conviction for child abuse, child neglect, spousal abuse, other crimes against a child (including child pornography), or for a crime involving violence (including rape, sexual assault, and homicide), and a felony conviction within the last 5 years for physical assault, battery, or a drug- or alcohol-related offense.[2385] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: BUT—and this is a big BUT—if the child is already living in your home, the judge can allow the child to continue living with you, even if you or someone else in the home has a “non-exemptible” conviction, especially if the child is doing well there.[2386]

    Juvenile Deliquency Court: Just the Basics
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What will I learn about juvenile delinquency court?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The types of cases that are in juvenile delinquency court.How a child’s case in juvenile delinquency court could affect your parent rights and your ability to reconnect with your child in reentry.Whether your criminal record could affect your child’s case in juvenile delinquency court.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following is a brief overview of juvenile delinquency court cases. We only include the basics because Root & Rebound is focused on providing information to people who are in reentry from prison and jail, and navigating legal issues with a criminal record. In general, we do not focus on situations in which a person is actively being charged with a crime in criminal or juvenile delinquency court. But because many people in reentry have children involved in the juvenile justice system, we are including a brief overview here to provide parents with some very basic information. If you have a child involved in a juvenile delinquency case, we recommend you speak with the juvenile delinquency court that is handling your child’s case, and your child’s attorney.
