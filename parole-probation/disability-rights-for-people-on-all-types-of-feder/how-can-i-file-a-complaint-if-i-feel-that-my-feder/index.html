        <h3><a id="_Toc448153094"></a>How can I file a complaint if I feel that my federal probation officer is not accommodating my disability, or feel that I am not getting access to parole services or programs?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, there are no special procedures or forms to seek accommodations for your disability, or to complain about overly restrictive conditions under federal supervision. There are several steps you can take to try and rectify the situation. </p>
        <p>STEP 1: If your disability makes it difficult to comply with your federal probation or parole conditions, or your conditions are overly strict and cause you harm due to your disability, the first thing to do is talk with your U.S. probation officer.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1020" id="footnote-ref-1020">[994]</a></sup></sup> You should explain:</p>
        <p><em>Your disability</em>; </p>
        <p><em>Which condition of supervision</em> is causing you problems due to your disability (e.g., drug testing conditions that prevent you from taking necessary medication) or how you are being <em>treated differently</em> due to your disability (e.g., you are stopped from participating in certain programs due to your disability or related medical treatment) or why you need additional help to participate in activities or follow the rules of supervision; <em>and</em></p>
        <p><em>What accommodations</em> (like changes in rules, policies, or procedures), services, or other assistance you need for your disability.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1021" id="footnote-ref-1021">[995]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p>If you have any other documents—such as a letter from your doctor or prescription for medication—you should show that to your probation officer. You can also remind your probation officer that federal law requires him or her to provide “reasonable accommodations” for your disability. Your probation officer, along with the judge and any medical providers who help you with your disability, will consider your situation and make a case-by-case decision about whether and how to accommodate your disability.</p>
        <p>STEP 2: If you are unhappy with your probation officer’s decision, you can ask a supervisor for assistance. If the probation department does not provide the assistance you need, you can go to court to request a change in your supervision conditions or other accommodations.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1022" id="footnote-ref-1022">[996]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p>STEP 3: You have the right to file an administrative complaint with the Department of Justice, which will investigate and attempt to resolve cases of discrimination based on disability, including a hearing and appeal process.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1023" id="footnote-ref-1023">[997]</a></sup></sup> Note, however that this process can take a long time to complete, so it’s best as a last resort.</p>
        <h2><a id="_Toc448153095"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="text">Being under some type of supervision is usually required for you to be released from prison or jail. In California, there are many types of supervision—state parole, county probation, Mandatory Supervision, PRCS, federal probation, Supervised, and federal parole. Hopefully now that you’ve read this Chapter, you better understand what it means to be under supervision, what special rules you have to follow, and all of the rights you have as a person in reentry.</p>
