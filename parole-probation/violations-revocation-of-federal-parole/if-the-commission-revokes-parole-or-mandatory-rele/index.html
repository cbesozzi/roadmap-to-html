  <p>
    If the commission revokes parole or mandatory release, does a parolee get any credit on the sentence for the time spent under supervision?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Generally, if you are convicted of a new law violation, you are entitled to credit for any of the time spent under supervision unless serving a Youth Corrections Act (YCA) or Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Act (NARA) commitment. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, there is no credit given for any time a parolee intentionally failed to respond or report to a Probation Officer or after a parolee has absconded from his or her area and the Probation Officer did not know where he or she was living. For violation of any of the other noncriminal conditions, a parolee generally will be credited for all of the time spent under supervision in the community.[987]
