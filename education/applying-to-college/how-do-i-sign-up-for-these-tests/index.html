          <p class="sidebox">If you are unable to take the SAT or ACT while you are incarcerated, you can still study and prepare for either test so that you are ready to be tested as soon as you are released. </p>
          <ol class="text">The SAT has no established procedure for allowing people who are incarcerated to take the test. You should check with your facility’s Education Department to see if you can arrange to take the SAT.<sup><a href="#footnote-2816" id="footnote-ref-2816">[2783]</a></sup> On the other hand, the ACT specifically allows people who are incarcerated to register for and take the test. This is called “arranged testing.” To ask for arranged testing, you will need to get and submit ACT’s “Request for Arranged Testing” form. You can get a copy of this form by calling the ACT Arranged Testing Line at 319-337-1510 or by writing to: ACT Arranged Testing, 301 ACT Drive, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, IA 52243-0168.</ol>
