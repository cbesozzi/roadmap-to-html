        <h3><a id="_Toc312427166"></a><a id="_Toc314389789"></a><a id="_Toc317247589"></a><a id="_Toc352861958"></a>What can i do if my money is being taken out of my salary for overdue child support payments?</h3>
        <p class="text"><em>If you are employed</em>, a portion of your wages will be automatically taken out to pay your current and/or overdue child support (called a <em>wage assignment</em> or <em>wage garnishment</em>).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2541" id="footnote-ref-2541">[2540]</a></sup></sup> This will happen even if you only owe <em>current</em> child support payments, without any overdue payments or interest. If your child support payments are being taken directly from your wages, you should not need to make other payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2542" id="footnote-ref-2542">[2541]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">If you are not employed, or if your child support is not being taken from your wages, you must make child support payments directly. </p>
        <h3><a id="FC_ChildSupport_AdjustAmountOwed"></a><a id="_Toc312427167"></a><a id="_Toc314389790"></a><a id="_Toc317247590"></a><a id="_Toc352861959"></a>Can I change or adjust the amount of child support I owe? ‚Ä¶While I am incarcerated? ‚Ä¶After my release? </h3>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your CURRENT and FUTURE child support payments is different than the process for changing your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt. This question will explain how to change your <em>current</em> child support payments. To learn about changing your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt, see PG.¬†777770.<strong> </strong></p>
        <p class="text">First the bad news: In general, you CANNOT go back and change the amount of past, overdue child support payments and interest that you owe. (The only exception is for child support orders issued on or after July 1, 2011, or if you agree to settle your past debts owed the other parent or the state‚Äîsee PG.¬†770 to learn more).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2543" id="footnote-ref-2543">[2542]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">But you CAN ask the judge to change the amount of child support that you have to pay in the future, starting from the date when you file your court papers. You CAN also ask the judge to set up a monthly payment plan so you can repay what you owe in installments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2544" id="footnote-ref-2544">[2543]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">To ask for a change in your child support payments while incarcerated, fill out the ‚ÄúIncarcerated Parent‚Äôs Request to Review Child Support‚Äù form and send it to your local child support agency (LCSA).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2545" id="footnote-ref-2545">[2544]</a></sup></sup> You can ask the prison or jail for a copy of this form, or for a sample form. If the form is not available, you should contact the LCSA immediately by phone or letter, and explain that you are incarcerated and need to change your child support payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2546" id="footnote-ref-2546">[2545]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">See Appendix¬†A, PG.¬†788, to find contact information for a list of LCSAs by county in California.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In general, the judge can only change the amount of child support you owe for <em>future</em> payments (starting from the day you file papers asking for the change). The judge cannot reduce the amount of <em>past</em> child support that you owe. Therefore, you should contact the LCSA and/or file your court papers <em>as soon as you are incarcerated</em>, if possible, to request a change in your payments.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>If you are served with new child support papers while in prison or jail</em>, you should contact the LCSA listed on the paperwork right away. It is best to contact the LCSA <em>in writing</em>, by filling out and sending back the blank <em>Response</em> form that you receive with the court papers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2547" id="footnote-ref-2547">[2546]</a></sup> You only have <em>30 days</em> (starting from the day you receive the papers) to respond to the LCSA and/or the court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2548" id="footnote-ref-2548">[2547]</a></sup></sup> You must notify the LCSA again once you are released.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2549" id="footnote-ref-2549">[2548]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">To change the amount of your current and future child support payments, you must ask the judge or LCSA (if involved in your case) to change your child support order.</p>
        <p class="text">See the chart on the next page as a guide for how to request a change to current and future child support payments.</p>

        <ul class="textbox"><em>If your driver‚Äôs license has been suspended due to unpaid child support</em>‚Ä¶ First, contact the LCSA to see if they can help make arrangements to have your license released. If you cannot pay the amount required by the LCSA, you can ask the judge to reinstate (give back) your license by filing a <em>Notice of Motion for Judicial Review of License Denial</em> (Form FL-670) with the family court that issued your child support order (see Appendix¬†L on PG.¬†815, for sample form).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2552" id="footnote-ref-2552">[2551]</a></sup></sup> <em>If there is a levy on your bank account</em>‚Ä¶ Contact the LCSA or call 1-866-901-3212 for any questions.<em>If your passport has a hold on it</em>‚Ä¶ Federal law requires that anyone who owes more than $2,500 in overdue child support cannot get a passport.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2553" id="footnote-ref-2553">[2552]</a></sup></sup> In California, you must pay off ALL of your overdue child support or have your child support case closed in order to get your passport released. Contact your LCSA for questions or assistance.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2554" id="footnote-ref-2554">[2553]</a></sup></sup></ul>
