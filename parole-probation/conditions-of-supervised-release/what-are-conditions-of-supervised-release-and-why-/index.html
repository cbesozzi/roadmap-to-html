          <h3><a id="_Toc448153014"></a>Wha<a id="supervisedreleseconditions"></a>t are conditions of supervised release, and why are they important?</h3>
          <p class="text">Your conditions of Supervised Release are rules set by the judge that you must follow if you want to remain in the community under supervision and not end up back in prison. These are called “release conditions”—and tell you what you can and can’t do in the community. </p>
          <p class="text">EXAMPLE of release conditions include:</p>
          <ol class="text">Not having guns or other weapons;</ol>
          <ol class="text">No contact with victims or witnesses; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Restrictions on your association with certain people or groups; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Restrictions on your travel; or </ol>
          <ol class="text">A curfew; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Community service; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Electronic monitoring; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Employment requirements; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Mental health treatment, or </ol>
          <ol class="text">Substance abuse treatment. </ol>
          <p class="text">It is important for you to know what conditions <em>you must follow</em> on Supervised Release so that you don’t get into trouble or sent back to prison for violating those rules. Also, be sure to talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about how to get connected to any needed services or resources offered in your community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-841" id="footnote-ref-841">[815]</a></sup></sup></p>
