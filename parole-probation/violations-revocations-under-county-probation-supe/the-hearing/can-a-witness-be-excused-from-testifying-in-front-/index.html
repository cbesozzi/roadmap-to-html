  <h3><a id="_Toc448152964"></a>Can a witness be excused from testifying in front of me at a probation revocation hearing?</h3>
  
  <p>Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you if they are deemed <em>fearful</em> or <em>confidential</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-762" id="footnote-ref-762">[736]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <ol class="text">“Fearful witnesses” are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee’s presence, but the parolee’s attorney must be present.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">“Confidential witnesses” are witnesses whose identity you are unaware of and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.<sup><a href="#footnote-763" id="footnote-ref-763">[737]</a></sup> However, if confidential information is used as part of the reason you’re charged with violating probation, you can request that the prosecutor disclose (reveal) this information or prove that revealing this information would create a risk of harm to the confidential witness.<sup><a href="#footnote-764" id="footnote-ref-764">[738]</a></sup></ol>
