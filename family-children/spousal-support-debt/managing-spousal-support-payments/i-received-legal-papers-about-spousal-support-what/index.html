  <p>
    I received legal papers about spousal support. What can I do?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have been “served” spousal support papers (meaning that someone has given you, or mailed you legal papers telling you that they have filed papers that ask the Family Court to issue an order about spousal or partner support), you should respond if you want to have input into the judge’s final decision.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To respond, you must file a “Responsive Declaration to Request for Order” (Form FL-320) and your “Income and Expense Declaration” (Form FL-150). Once you have filled out the forms, you could ask your Family Law Facilitator to review them before filing with the court clerk. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After you have filed your forms, you must serve your spouse/partner with your response and your Form FL-320 at least 9 days before the hearing (which is scheduled at the time you file your response with the court clerk).
