    How do I target my job search and find the best fit?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Consider the type of job you’re applying for.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Employers will be more concerned if the job position you are applying for requires you to do work that directly relates to your past convictions. For example, if you’ve been convicted of theft, this may concern an employer who is looking to hire someone to become a manager or cashier at a store. If you can proactively point out that the circumstances of your crime—including the seriousness of the offense and the length of time since it occurred—won’t affect your ability to do the job, an employer is more likely to feel you will be an honest and truthful worker. Also, there may be some types of jobs or occupational licenses that you can’t hold by law, based on your conviction offense. See PG. 746 for more information about legal restrictions for certain types of jobs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. Consider the type of employer you’re applying to. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Consider the type, size, and management style of the company to which you are applying. Most applications ask whether or not you have been convicted of a crime, but some only ask about felonies. Some experts suggest that applying to a small business could be more successful than a larger corporation, because this allows you the opportunity to speak directly with the owner and explain what happened.
