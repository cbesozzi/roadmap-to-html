          <h4 class="sidebox">SENTENCING REFORM ACT </h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Some historical background: In 1984, as part of the Sentencing Reform Act (“SRA”) that created the federal sentencing guidelines system, Congress got rid of federal parole and created Supervised Release. </p>
          <p class="text">Supervised release is overseen by Federal District Courts with the assistance of federal probation officers.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-828" id="footnote-ref-828">[802]</a></sup></sup> The judge can sentence you to a term of supervised release <em>in addition to a prison sentence</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-829" id="footnote-ref-829">[803]</a></sup></sup> In other words, a term of supervised release does not replace any time you are sentenced to prison; rather, a judge orders supervised release in addition to any term in prison you may serve.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-830" id="footnote-ref-830">[804]</a></sup></sup> In some cases, the judge that sentences you is actually <em>required by law</em> to impose a term of supervised release in addition to a prison term.<sup><a href="#footnote-831" id="footnote-ref-831">[805]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">It’s common today for a federal sentence to include a period of time in prison, followed by a period of time in the community on supervised release.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintSupervised Release vs. Federal Probation:<br/>What’s the difference between the two?</h4>
          <p class="textbox">Federal Probation: Federal probation is a substitute for incarceration, meaning that probation is ordered <em>instead of</em> incarceration. Supervised release: Supervised release is ordered <em>in addition to</em> incarceration. This means that after you are released from prison, you may be placed on supervised release. Note that the same terms and conditions generally apply to both people on federal probation and on supervised release. </p>
