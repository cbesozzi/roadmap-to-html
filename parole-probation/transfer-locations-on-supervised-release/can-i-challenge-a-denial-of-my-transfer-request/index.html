  <h3><a id="_Toc448153032"></a>Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor’s approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-877" id="footnote-ref-877">[851]</a></sup></p>
