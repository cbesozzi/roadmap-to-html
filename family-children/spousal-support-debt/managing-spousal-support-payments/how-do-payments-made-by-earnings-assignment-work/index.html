          <ol class="text">When the court orders ‚Äúwage garnishments,‚Äù your employer receives court papers that will tell him or her the amount of money that should be taken out (withheld) from your check each pay period. Once your employer receives this paperwork, he or she has just a few days to start taking the money out from your next paycheck.<sup><a href="#footnote-2531" id="footnote-ref-2531">[2499]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">Once this money is taken from your paycheck (or ‚Äúwithheld), your employer will send your money based on the type of order was issued. If your order was for:</p>
