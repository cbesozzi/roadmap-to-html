  <p>
    How often do I have to see my probation officer if I am on federal probation?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. How often you must report to your probation officer varies widely based on the individual “supervision plan” developed for you by your probation officer.[772] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some supervision plans require weekly meetings and even more frequent phone contact; for others, occasional or monthly contact is sufficient. Meetings may take place at the probation office, your home, or your workplace.[773] Probation officers sometimes make “surprise” visits. For this reason, it is important that you always inform your probation officer of any changes to your work schedule.
