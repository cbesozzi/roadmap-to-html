        <h3><a id="_Toc317247527"></a><a id="_Toc448153626"></a>Why would i go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with my child? </h3>
        <p class="text">You would go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with your child or grandchild if CPS is involved in investigating an allegation of child abuse or neglect. As a parent, that could mean your child was taken away from you or the child’s caregiver. You would attend juvenile court proceedings to try and resolve the allegations of abuse and neglect.<sup><a href="#footnote-2375" id="footnote-ref-2375">[2343]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">A grandparent could be involved either because the grandparent is accused of abuse or neglect or the grandparent wants to become the child’s guardian while the investigation by CPS continues.<sup><a href="#footnote-2376" id="footnote-ref-2376">[2344]</a></sup></p>
