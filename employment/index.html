          <p><strong>The EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER will help you prepare to reenter the workforce and will guide you throughout the job application process. You will learn about your rights when an employer runs a background check on you, how and when an employer may consider your criminal record, and how to protect your rights in these situations. This Chapter will also help you if you want to apply for a professional or occupational license, start your own small business, or consider other alternatives to traditional employment. Finally, this Chapter will explain your rights in the workplace if your incarceration was the result of a disability, and how to protect yourself against illegal discrimination. </strong></p>
          <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>
