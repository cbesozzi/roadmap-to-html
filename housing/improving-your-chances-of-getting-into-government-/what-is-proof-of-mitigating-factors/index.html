  <p>
    What is “proof of mitigating factors?”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Proof of mitigating factors” is extra information and evidence that explains that the PHA or landlord should not view the offense or conduct as negatively as it might otherwise. You can submit things like:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WARNING ABOUT what information you share with landlords:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are applying to private housing, be careful not to share any more information than necessary—see PG. 425 to understand what criminal record information a private landlord can access, and see PG. 408 to learn ways you can identify illegal discrimination by private landlords (which has a different legal standard than discrimination by government-assisted housing providers and Public Housing Authorities (PHA).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A period of time has passed since your conviction or criminal activity (the crime was not very recent);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were convicted at a young age;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The nature and extent of your conduct are less involved (like showing you were not as involved in the offense/ conduct as one might think);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Physical or emotional abuse, coercion, or untreated abuse or mental illness that led to the conviction (and any of these factors might have led to the crime/offense);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Disabilities that you or a family member has that might have led to the conviction; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any additional context for the conviction (other factors that would help explain the circumstances you were in when the offense occurred and why it should be viewed with more leniency).
