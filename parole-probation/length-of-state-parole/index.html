          <h1>Length of State Parole</h1>
          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="PP_StateParole_length"></a><a id="_Toc448152789"></a>Length of State Parole</h2>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152790"></a>How DO I know the length of my parole? who calculates it?</h3>
          <p class="text">Your parole date will be listed on your CDCR Form 1515,<em> </em>“Notice and Conditions of Parole” (see example <strong>i</strong>n<strong> </strong>Appendix G<strong>, </strong>PG. 302). Parole will be responsible for calculating these dates based on state law, and your parole agent must tell you what they are.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152791"></a>If I am on state parole, what law sets the length of my parole? </h3>
          <p class="text">If you are on state parole, the length of your parole period is set by state law<sup><a href="#footnote-376" id="footnote-ref-376">[376]</a></sup> and is based on your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you are or were incarcerated for), and <em>when the commitment offense occurred</em>. When determining your base parole period and maximum parole period, what matters is the wording of the law <em>at the time of the commitment offense</em> (NOT on the date you were sentenced, and NOT on the date you were released onto parole).<sup><a href="#footnote-377" id="footnote-ref-377">[377]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">In most cases, there is a minimum parole period that can be increased up to a maximum parole period if you commit parole violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-378" id="footnote-ref-378">[378]</a></sup> Because state laws set the minimum and maximum parole term lengths, the date that a person actually gets off parole will be determined by a number of factors. See PG. 170 for more information. </p>
          <p class="text">There are three discharge dates — a controlling discharge date, a maximum discharge date, and a presumptive discharge date — that together determine when you actually get off parole. And there are a number of factors that interact with those three dates to determine whether you’re eligible to get off parole earlier or later than originally expected. See the chart on PG. 170 below for a detailed description of these three dates and how they interact.</p>
          <p class="text">You can find the parole term lengths in California Penal Code § 3000(b) (for set-length parole terms) and § 3000.1 (for life-long parole terms). For your reference, we have included copies of the current versions of these laws in Appendix F, PG. 298. (The California Penal Code is a body of laws that apply to crimes, parole, and other criminal justice system-related laws in California). To look up the discharge dates that apply to you, see Appendix C, PG. 294 of this chapter.</p>
          <table><tr><td colspan="3"><p><strong>THE 3 DISCHARGE DATES YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong></p><p><strong>TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU GET OFF PAROLE</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="tablestyle2"><strong>CONTROLLING DISCH</strong><a id="cdddischargechart"></a><strong>ARGE DATE (CDD)</strong></p></td><td><p class="tablestyle2"><strong>MAXIMUM DISCHARGE DATE (MDD)</strong></p></td><td><p class="tablestyle2"><strong>PRESUMPTIVE DISCHARGE DATE (PDD)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>THIS IS YOUR BASE PAROLE PERIOD.</p><p>Your CDD is the date that you are set to be discharged from parole if nothing changes—your base term. </p><p>For example, if someone is on parole for 5 years with a maximum of 7 years, then the Controlling Discharge Date (CDD) is 5 years from the day of release from state prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-379" id="footnote-ref-379">[379]</a></sup></sup> </p><div class="textbox8">(NOTE: These parole length calculations are based on state law.

You can only get off on your PDD if you have served parole continuously without disruptions, meaning no revocation/violation time, suspensions, or “dead time” for absconding (going missing or failing to report to your parole agent).</p><p>For example, someone might have a 5-year parole length with a Presumptive Discharge Date (PDD) of 3 years. This means that the person is eligible to be discharged after 3 continuous years on parole.</p><div class="textbox8">(NOTE: These parole length calculations are based on state law. There is a sample worksheet for how to calculate your parole discharge date in Appendix C, PG. 294 of this chapter)IMPORTANT! Some people do not have a PDD—meaning certain individuals do not have a date on which they are eligible to get off parole early.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-382" id="footnote-ref-382">[382]</a></sup></sup> This is based on what your commitment offense was and when it happened. Go to Appendix C, PG. 294 of this chapter to determine your PDD, if you have one.</div></td></tr></table>
          <p class="text">For an example of how you can calculate your own parole discharge date, see Appendix C, PG. 294. To determine your CDD, MDD, and PDD, see Appendix B, PG. 292.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
          <p class="textbox">In addition to these three very important dates, you can ask your parole agent to recommend that you get off parole even earlier than your presumptive discharge date (PDD) — but this is very hard to achieve. For you to get off parole earlier than your PDD, every level of authority has to agree: the parole agent and his or her supervisor, the Regional Administrator for your parole region, and, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) must each approve your early release from parole.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152792"></a>What can I do if I think my parole term has been miscalculated?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you believe your parole term has been miscalculated, you can and should APPEAL (challenge) your parole term length with CDCR. You must exhaust the appeal process before you can go to court. </p>
          <p class="text">First, understand the timelines for filing an appeal (see box below). Then, follow the three steps, starting on PG. 171, to file your appeal.<strong> </strong></p>
