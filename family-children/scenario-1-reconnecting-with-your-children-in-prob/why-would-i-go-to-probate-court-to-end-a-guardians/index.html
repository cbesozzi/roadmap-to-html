          <h1>Why would I go to probate court to end a guardianship?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc317247510"></a><a id="_Toc448153609"></a>Why would I go to probate court to end a guardianship?</h3>
          <p class="text">You would go to probate court to end a guardianship if someone else (other than the child‚Äôs parents) was given guardianship of your child while you were incarcerated. If a judge in probate court formally created the guardianship, then you have to go to probate court to end it. </p>
          <h5 class="question">If I have been incarcerated and someone else is the guardian of my child, what are my legal rights as a parent?</h5>
          <p class="text">Guardianship does NOT end your parental rights; it only puts your parental rights on hold while the guardian has custody of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2343" id="footnote-ref-2343">[2311]</a></sup> </sup>This allows the guardian(s) to make all the decisions about caring for the child that a parent would make, without permanently cutting off the parents‚Äô rights to ask for custody of their child back in the future.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2344" id="footnote-ref-2344">[2312]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Parent‚Äôs Rights:</span></p>
          <p class="text">The child‚Äôs legal or biological parents still have certain <em>rights</em> for their child during the guardianship:</p>
          <ol class="text">The children in a guardianship are still considered legally and biologically ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to their parents (the parents‚Äô rights are not terminated);</ol>
          <ol class="text">The judge or the guardian of the child can allow the parents or other relatives to visit with the children in a guardianship;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2345" id="footnote-ref-2345">[2313]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">When the judge appoints a guardian to have custody of a child, the judge may also give visitation rights to the child‚Äôs parent(s) and/or sibling(s) to visit the child</ol>
          <ol class="text">If the judge orders visitation, the child‚Äôs guardian must allow these visits to take place. </ol>
          <ol class="text">If there is no court order for visitation, the guardian has the right to decide whether the child may visit with his/her parent(s) or other relatives.<strong> </strong>So if you don't have a court order and the guardian is not letting you see your child, you might need to go to Probate Court to ask the judge for visitation. </ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>Please Note:</em> You will need to ask for visitation from <em>the same probate court</em> that appointed your child‚Äôs current guardian, which may be in a different county from where you live. You will also need to use that county‚Äôs own specific probate court forms to request visitation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2346" id="footnote-ref-2346">[2314]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Parent‚Äôs Responsibilities:</span></p>
          <p class="text">The child‚Äôs legal or biological parents also still have certain <em>responsibilities</em> for their child during the guardianship:</p>
          <ol class="text">Parents must continue to financially support their children in a guardianship (including paying child support if it‚Äôs ordered ‚Äì read more about child support on PG.¬†960. Also, children in a guardianship can inherit money or get Social Security benefits from their parents.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2347" id="footnote-ref-2347">[2315]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If you are currently or about to become incarcerated and would like to learn how to pause your child support payments, see PG.¬†962 in the ‚ÄúChild Support‚Äù section.</ol>
