  <p>
    If I was denied government-assisted housing, how will I know the reason why?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were denied housing due to information that showed up in your criminal record, then the PHA also MUST give you a copy of the criminal record it used. This will help you to understand why you were denied.[1237]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Furthermore, if you are denied admission to federal government-assisted housing, you have the right to WRITTEN detailed notice of the denial—THIS SHOULD EXPLAIN THE SPECIFIC REASON(S) YOU WERE DENIED![1238] Sometimes, PHAs and owners will give you a general notice just telling you that you were denied, but not the specific conduct or offense that was the basis for the decision. If you get a general notice without the important details, you should ask for the detailed notice—which you have the right to! The PHA or owner of government-assisted housing MUST provide you with a detailed notice by law.[1239]

    Challenging the rejection may give you the necessary time to improve or gather information to clarify your criminal history. If you haven’t already done so, you should request a copy of your criminal record and try to correct any mistakes. [CROSS-REFERENCE TO RECORD-CLEANING SECTION] You should also gather evidence of rehabilitation and mitigating evidence.
