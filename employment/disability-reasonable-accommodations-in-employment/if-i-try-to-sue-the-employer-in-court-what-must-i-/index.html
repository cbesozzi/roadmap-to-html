  <p>
    If I try to sue the employer in court, what must I prove?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To sue an employer under the federal ADA (FHA), California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act),[1947] you must show that your status as an individual with a disability was a motivating factor in the employer’s decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.[1948] You must also provide evidence that your disability substantially limited your ability to live a normal life,[1949] that the requested accommodation is reasonable and necessary, and (for a disability related to substance abuse) that you are not currently using illegal drugs. [1950]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember, you CANNOT sue an employer in court until AFTER you’ve filed a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH and received a Right-to-Sue notice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: You should be prepared for the employer to argue that you do NOT have a protected disability because you are a “current user” of illegal drugs, or that you are not being treated for your mental illness.[1951] You can support your request by providing treatment records showing that you have not used drugs for a significant period of time, or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.[1952] You should also provide evidence of your participation in or completion of a drug abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness.
