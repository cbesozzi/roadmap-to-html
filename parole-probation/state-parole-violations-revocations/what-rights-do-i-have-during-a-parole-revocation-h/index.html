        <h1>What rights do I have during a parole revocation hearing?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152848"></a>What rights do I have during a parole revocation hearing?</h3>
        <p>The superior court judge cannot suspend or revoke your parole unless there is ‚Äúgood cause‚Äù (a good reason) to believe that you have violated your parole conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-589" id="footnote-ref-589">[564]</a></sup></p>
        <p>As a parolee, you have the following rights:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to receive written notice of the alleged violation (the rule or law that Parole claims you have broken) and possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain evidence that can help explain or justify your actions.<sup><a href="#footnote-590" id="footnote-ref-590">[565]</a></sup></strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to have Parole disclose any evidence against you (just like at trial).<sup><a href="#footnote-591" id="footnote-ref-591">[566]</a></sup></strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to timely hearing of the charges ‚Äî including a probable cause hearing and a formal revocation hearing (within 90 days if you were not granted bail).<sup><a href="#footnote-592" id="footnote-ref-592">[567]</a></sup></strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to present witnesses and documentary evidence.<sup><a href="#footnote-593" id="footnote-ref-593">[568]</a></sup> </strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who speak against your interest<sup><a href="#footnote-594" id="footnote-ref-594">[569]</a></sup> You have a conditional right under the U.S. and California constitutions to cross-examine people whose statements are used against you in a parole violation proceeding.<sup><a href="#footnote-595" id="footnote-ref-595">[570]</a></sup> BUT SEE NOTE BELOW!</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to a ‚Äúneutral and detached hearing body‚Äù (meaning a fair and unbiased judge).<sup><a href="#footnote-596" id="footnote-ref-596">[571]</a></sup> </strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The right to receive a written statement of the decision, the evidence relied on, and the reasons for revoking parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-597" id="footnote-ref-597">[572]</a></sup></strong></p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! You may waive (give up) your right to a revocation hearing by admitting that you violated parole.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-598" id="footnote-ref-598">[573]</a></sup></strong> If you believe your rights are violated during the process or in a hearing, you should SAY SOMETHING. If you are unsure about whether your rights have been violated, or if you don‚Äôt understand your rights, ask your lawyer or public defender. If you do not have a lawyer or public defender, call your local public defender‚Äôs office. </p>
        <p class="text">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WITNESSES: Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you at your parole revocation hearing if they are considered to be <em>fearful</em> or <em>confidential</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-599" id="footnote-ref-599">[574]</a></sup> Before your hearing, talk with your lawyer about all potential witnesses ‚Äî those for you and those against you. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>‚ÄúFearful witnesses‚Äù</strong> are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee‚Äôs presence, but your attorney must be present.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>‚ÄúConfidential witnesses‚Äù</strong> are witnesses, whose identity is not known to you, and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.<sup><a href="#footnote-600" id="footnote-ref-600">[575]</a></sup> However, if confidential information is used as part of the evidence that you violated parole, you can ask the District Attorney (prosecutor) to show you this information. If the District Attorney refuses to show you this information, then he or she must prove that showing you this information would create a risk of harm to the informant. </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152849"></a>What happens if an important state witness doesn‚Äôt show up to my parole revocation hearing?</h3>
        <p>If a ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù (essential) state witness fails to attend your parole revocation hearing and the hearing cannot fairly proceed without the witness, the court can postpone the hearing or dismiss the case against you.</p>
        <p>To decide whether the witness‚Äôs testimony would be ‚Äúmaterial,‚Äù the court should balance the importance of the witness‚Äôs expected testimony against the availability and reliability of another source of the same information. Also, if the state‚Äôs material witnesses fail to appear, but <em>your witnesses</em> are present, you and your attorney may want to ask that the judge take the testimony of your witnesses before postponing the rest of the hearing.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152850"></a>At my parole revocation hearing, Can the district attorney bring evidence that was found in an unlawful search or seizure?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Unfortunately, the ‚Äúexclusionary rule,‚Äù which applies in criminal cases, does not apply in parole revocation hearings. This means that unlawfully obtained evidence may be used against you in your parole revocation hearing ‚Äî even if it would be excluded from a criminal court trial, and even if actually was excluded from a criminal court trial related to the same issue.<sup><a href="#footnote-601" id="footnote-ref-601">[576]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="textbox">SUMMARY of SENTENCINGWhat are the court‚Äôs 3 options for sentencing/ punishment if it finds that I violated my state parole?</h4>
        <p class="textbox">The court‚Äôs 3 options are: </p>
        <ul class="textbox">Return you to parole supervision with changes (called ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù) to your conditions of parole, including possible time in county jail;Refer you to a Reentry Court or other Evidence-Based Practice program; orRevoke your parole and order confinement.<sup><a href="#footnote-602" id="footnote-ref-602">[577]</a></sup></ul>
