  <h2><a href="/the-building-blocks-of-reentry/voting-on-election-day/who-is-not-required-to-register-with-selective-ser/index.html">Who is not required to register with Selective Service?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Who is not required to register with Selective Service?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are NOT required to register with the Selective Service if you fit in one of the categories below:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1) Certain people who are confined:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People who are incarcerated in jail or prison[292] — You DO NOT have to register for the Selective Service while incarcerated, even if you are a male between ages 18 and 25. But if you are age 25 or younger at the time of your release, you must register within 30 days of getting out.[293]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People who are being kept in a hospital or institution for medical reasons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2) Certain people who have disabilities:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People with a mental or physical disability that prevents them from functioning in public, with or without assistance. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People who have been confined continuously to a residence, hospital, or institution from age 18 to age 25.[294]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3) Certain non-citizens:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lawful non-immigrants holding visas in the United States
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Seasonal agricultural workers holding visas (H-2A).[295]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (4) Certain military members:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Members of the U.S. Armed Forces on active duty.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cadets or midshipmen in a U.S. Service Academy or Coast Guard Academy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Students in Officer Procurement Programs at certain U.S. military colleges.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (5) Certain people who have had a sex change:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People who were born female (assigned female at birth) and have had a sex change are not required  to register with the Selective Service. However, people who were born male (assigned male at birth) and have had a sex change are required to register.[296]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When do I register with the Selective Service? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must register within 30 days of your 18th birthday. The Selective Service will accept your late registration through age 25 (up until the last day before you turn 26, but not after).[297] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I register with the Selective Service? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can register in 3 ways, and all are equally acceptable. You can register (1) online, (2) by filling out a paper registration form and mailing it to the Selective Service System, OR (3) by checking the “Register Me” option on the Federal Student Financial Aid Application (called the “FAFSA”). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do I need a Social Security Number (SSN) to register with the Selective Service?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No. If you have a SSN, you must provide it when registering; but if you don’t have one, it’s not required.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1) Registering online:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have access to a computer with Internet access, this is the fastest and easiest way to register. (Most public libraries have free computer access; see PG. 80 for more information on public library access.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Go to https://www.sss.gov/RegVer/wfRegistration.aspx.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fill out the online form and then click “Submit Registration.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2) Registering by mail:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can find the Selective Service registration form at any U.S. post office and at many high schools. If you want to find it online and print it out to send in by mail, you can go to https://www.sss.gov/PDFs/Regform_copyINT.pdf.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fill out the form and mail it to: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Selective Service System
  </p>
  
  <p>
    P.O. Box 94638
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Palatine, IL 60094-4638[298]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3) Registering through FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid):
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are a student applying for federal student financial aid using the FAFSA, you can register simply by checking “Register Me” on Box #22 of that application form. The U.S. Department of Education will send your information to the Selective Service, and you are done!
