This Chapter will teach you how to establish or re-establish your rights, responsibilities, and relationship with your child(ren), and how to navigate the family court systems so that you can best handle any issues related to custody, guardianship, juvenile dependency/CPS cases, visitation, child support, spousal support, paternity, and ending marriages or domestic partnerships.</p>
                <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation. </p>

                <p class="text">If you are a parent or caregiver with a criminal record, and you have legal issues related to your family situation, it can help to know some basic legal concepts like: <em>What is a guardian? What are custody and visitation?</em> Here, we explain the definitions of some of the key terms that will appear again and again in this Chapter, so you can refer back.<span class="emphasisheavy">Adoption: </span>Adoption means giving complete parental rights and responsibilities to someone who is not the child’s biological (“by blood”) parent. Once the adoption is final, the adoptive parents are considered to be the child’s new legal parents, and the child’s birth parents no longer have any rights to the child. Adoption is permanent, meaning it generally can’t be changed afterward. An adoptive parent can be a stepparent or domestic partner of one of the child’s birth parents, a relative who has been caring for the child, or someone not related to the child by blood.<a id="FamilyChildren_Arrears"></a><span class="emphasisheavy">Arrears:</span> Arrears are unpaid, overdue child support payments (child support debt). In other words, arrears are money you owe from past child support payments that you did not make. Arrears are different from <em>current</em> child support payments that you have to make now, which cover the cost of caring for your child today. Often, there are different rules for arrears (child support debt) and current child support payments (child support you owe now), so it’s important to know the difference. In addition, the state will charge you interest (10%) on your arrears, so the debt amount you owe will continue to increase—even if you’re actively paying your <em>current</em> child support payments.<span class="emphasisheavy">“Best Interest of the Child”:</span> This is the legal standard in any legal case involving a child’s care (like child custody and visitation cases) that the judge will use. The judge will ask what is in the “best interest of the child,” looking at factors like: the parent or caregiver’s criminal records and Child Protective Services (CPD) record, the child’s health and safety, and whether the child will be raised in a stable and loving environment.</p>
                <a id="FC_Terms_CasePlan"></a>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Case Plan:</span> A case plan is created by Child Protective Services (CPS) when it gets involved in a case regarding your child. The case plan sets out the steps you must take to get your child back. For example, a case plan could require you to attend parenting or counseling classes, participate in substance abuse treatment, and/or visit with your child. If CPS has removed your child from your home, your CPS social worker or the juvenile dependency court judge should give you a copy of your case plan, and as part of the case plan, the county must offer you certain programs and services that you need to complete your case plan for a limited amount of time upon reentry (see the term for “Family Reunification Services” for more information below). </p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHO MIGHT BE A CAREIVER?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The person caring for your child may be the child’s <em>other parent</em>, or may be a relative, family friend, foster parent, or someone else who has a relationship with your child. These are just some <em>examples</em> of people who might be caregivers – so your child’s situation may be different!</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Caregiver:</span> A caregiver is a person responsible for a child’s care and supervision from day to day. The caregiver may or may not be the child’s biological parent OR the child’s legal guardian. In some cases, a caregiver who is a close blood relative of the child will have more legal rights in a given situation than a non-relative (meaning unrelated) caregiver.<span class="emphasisheavy">Child Support Payment:</span> A judge may order the parent who does <em>not</em> have custody (see definition below) of the child to pay child support to the parent who does have custody of the child. This “child support payment” is to help cover the cost of caring for the child.<span class="emphasisheavy">Child Protective Services (CPS):</span> CPS is the part of the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) that responds to reports of child abuse or neglect. Every county in California has a CPS office.<a id="FamilyChildren_CourtOrder_definition"></a><span class="emphasisheavy">Court Order:</span> A “court order” is a decision by a judge in court, usually in writing. A court order requires someone to do OR not do something. A court order might say whether you currently have custody and/or visitation with your child; who else has custody and/or visitation with your child; and which court is involved in your family’s case. Court orders also require you to do things like attend a parenting class or prevent you from contacting someone. It is important to know about any court orders in your child’s case, because a court order may restrict how and when you can contact your child OR your child’s caregiver—and will help you understand what steps to take next.<span class="emphasisheavy">Custodial Parent:</span> The custodial parent is the parent who has <em>physical custody</em> of his or her child, meaning the child <em>lives with</em> this parent.<em> For comparison, see also definition for “non-custodial parent” below.</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Custody:</span> Custody is the legal rights and responsibilities to live with and care for your child. While you were in prison/jail, you were unable to have custody of your child. Once you’re released, if you want to communicate with, visit, or get custody of your child, you will need to find out who has custody of your child now.</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Physical Custody:</span> The legal right to have your child live with you.<span class="emphasisheavy">Legal Custody:</span> The legal right to make important decisions about your child’s health, education, and well-being.</ol>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Declaration of Paternity:</span> A “Declaration of Paternity” is a legal document that says who is the “natural father” (the biological father) of a child. It must be signed by <em>both</em> of the child’s biological parents (father and mother).<span class="emphasisheavy">Dependency Court: </span>The court family cases are started in if a child’s parent(s) are suspected of abuse or neglect and Child Protective Services (CPS) has become involved in the child’s case.<span class="emphasisheavy">Family Law Facilitator (sometimes called the Self-Help Facilitator):</span> Every family court should have a “Family Law Facilitator,” which is someone who can help you with court forms, answer questions, provide general information about family law issues, and walk you through some of the steps of your case if you do not have a lawyer. However, the Family Law Facilitator <em>cannot</em> give any legal advice or answer questions about a specific case. To find your local Family Law Facilitator, see Appendix A, PG. 881, or go to <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-facilitators.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-facilitators.htm</a>.<span class="emphasisheavy">Family Reunification Services:</span> These are services that Child Protective Services (CPS) must provide you with, with certain exceptions, if it is involved in a legal case regarding you and your child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2199" id="footnote-ref-2199">[2199]</a></sup> Family reunification services are meant to help you complete your “case plan” (see definition above) and any other dependency court requirements to encourage reunification with your child.<span class="emphasisheavy">Foster Care:</span> Sometimes when a child is removed from his or her parents’ home, the judge will send the child to live in a “foster care” placement. “Foster care” describes the placement of a child living with one or two “foster parents”—people who the State has licensed, trained and approved to care for children in their home. However, foster parents have fewer rights than legal guardians or biological parents, so the judge and Child Protective Services (CPS) will continue to be legally responsible for making decisions about the child.<span class="emphasisheavy">Guardian (or “Legal Guardian”):</span> A guardian is an adult (not the child’s parent), such as a relative or family friend, who has legal and physical custody (see definitions under “custody” above) of the child. A guardianship does <em>not</em> terminate the parental rights of the child’s legal or biological parents; it only puts their parental rights on hold while the guardian has physical and legal custody.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2200" id="footnote-ref-2200">[2200]</a></sup></sup> Learn more about guardians on PG. 827.<a id="FamilyChildren_LienDefinition"></a><span class="emphasisheavy">Lien:</span> A lien is the right to take (and sell) property belonging to another person until that person pays off a debt s/he owes. For more information about liens, read the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717.<span class="emphasisheavy">Local Child Support Agency (LCSA): </span>LCSAs are county-run offices that collect and enforce child support payments by making sure that custodial parents and guardians receive the payments from non-custodial parents.<span class="emphasisheavy">Non-Custodial Parent:</span> The non-custodial parent is the parent who does <em>not</em> have physical custody of his or her child. <em>For comparison, see also definition for “custodial parent” above.</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Notice:</span> In any case involving you and your rights as a parent, you are legally required to receive “notice” of the case, which means you must be informed of the case. This “notice” could be a letter mailed to you, an announcement made by the judge in court, paperwork handed to you in person in court, at your home, or while you are incarcerated. Depending on your role in the case, you may have the right to get the “notice” papers handed to you IN PERSON—even while incarcerated. Often, a local law enforcement officer or Sheriff takes on the role of giving people “notice” papers inside prison or jail. <span class="emphasisheavy">Parent</span>: We use the term “parent” to describe the child’s legal or biological mother or father, with the understanding that the child’s parent(s) may or may not be caring for the child from day to day. <em>See also “caregiver” to understand how that person could be someone other than a child’s “parent.”</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Parental Rights:</span> Parents (see definition above) have a lot of legal rights with respect to their minor children, including the right to live with, care for, and make decisions for their children under the age of 18. These rights are called “parental rights.” In some situations, a parent’s rights can be temporarily put on hold and/or given to someone else (such as a legal guardian). In extreme situations, a parent’s rights may be taken away permanently (through the termination of parental rights and adoption of the child by another person or family). However, parents have the right to special legal protections before their legal rights can be changed or taken away without their permission.<span class="emphasisheavy">Petition/Petitioner:</span> A petition is a legal document that asks a judge to do or not do something. A petitioner is the person (or people) who asks the judge to do this, by filing the petition in court. <span class="emphasisheavy">Restraining Order (Protective Order):</span> A restraining order is a court order from a judge that can protect someone from being physically harmed, threatened, stalked, or harassed. The person who asks for and is protected by the restraining order is called the “protected person” (or protected party). The person whom the restraining order is against is called the “restrained person” (or restrained party). <em>There are several types of restraining orders:</em><span class="emphasisheavy">Domestic violence restraining order:</span> if someone is the victim of domestic violence, they can request a domestic violence restraining order.<span class="emphasisheavy">Personal conduct order:</span> This type of order prohibits (stops) the restrained person from doing specific acts towards the protected person. For example, the order may prohibit the restrained person from contacting, stalking, sexually assaulting, or destroying property of the protected person. <span class="emphasisheavy">Stay-away order</span>: This type of order requires the restrained person to stay a certain distance away from the protected person and/or from a specific place (such as the protected person’s house or workplace).<span class="emphasisheavy">Residence exclusion order</span>: This type of order requires the restrained person to move out from where the protected person lives, and to take only their own clothing or personal belongings until there is a court hearing. <span class="emphasisheavy">Reunification</span>: Reunification can mean 2 things: In the real world (i.e., outside of court), reunification can mean reuniting with your child and (re)developing a relationship with him/her. In court, reunification means getting back your legal right to care for your child, after s/he has been removed by CPS.<span class="emphasisheavy">Removal</span>: When CPS or a judge takes a child away from his/her parent’s custody. <span class="emphasisheavy">Visitation</span>: Visitation is the legal right to spend time with your child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2201" id="footnote-ref-2201">[2201]</a></sup></sup> When a judge makes a custody order, he/she must give visitation rights to the parent who does not have custody of the child, unless granting visitation is not in the child’s best interest.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2202" id="footnote-ref-2202">[2202]</a></sup></sup>Now that you’ve learned some of the basics, keep reading to learn more about the child custody, child visitation, the court system, guardianship, other legal issues related to families and partnerships, and child support.</p>

                <p class="text">Before we jump deep into family law issues, we think it’s important to understand what a “criminal record” is. In the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029, we go into more detail about what a criminal record is and who can access it. Here is a quick summary.Your “criminal record” is the broad term used to describe <em>any contact</em> you have had with law enforcement, the courts, or another part of the criminal justice system that was written down (recorded). Your entire criminal record includes: arrests (whether or not they led to a conviction), any criminal charges filed against you, convictions (felonies or misdemeanors, even if they get “expunged”), pleas, acquittals (“not guilty” findings), dismissals, sentences, periods of incarceration in jail or prison, and any other contact with the criminal justice system. BUT—and this is an important but—not everyone can see this entire record because some criminal records are <em>protected under certain circumstances.</em> To learn more about criminal records, go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER on PG. 717.</p>

                <h4 class="sidebox">What are examples of legal cases involving children?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Examples of legal cases involving children include cases about: custody, visitation, ending a marriage, adoption, guardianship, CPS/dependency cases, and fostering a child.  These cases may also involve questions about paternity/parentage, child support, spousal support, and/or protective orders.</p>
                <p class="text">In any legal case involving children, a criminal record could, and often does, affect your ability to reconnect with a child or grandchild.A judge making decisions about the care of a child will look at anything and everything about a child’s and the parents’ life that relates to the well-being of the child and who is best suited to care for and have a relationship with that child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2203" id="footnote-ref-2203">[2203]</a></sup> </sup>This includes the judge looking at things like:</p>

                <p class="text">Not necessarily. Although it may seem like parents and grandparents would have automatic rights to care for a child, being blood-related (biologically related) or married to someone who is blood-related to a child does not mean you automatically have the right to live with, see, or make decisions about your child or grandchild. It’s also important to note that the legal rights of parents are MUCH stronger than those of grandparents. Below we discuss whether you have the legal right to care for a child as a parent and grandparent:<span class="emphasisitalic"><em>For Parents:</em></span> The law assumes that a child’s parents—whether biological or adopted—will make decisions that are in the “best interest of the child” and so they generally have the automatic legal right to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-2211" id="footnote-ref-2211">[2211]</a></sup> Courts get involved when something goes wrong, and then the judge must make decisions based on what is in “the best interest of the child” (more on what factors a judge looks at in deciding what is in the “best interest of the child” on PG. 809.</p>
                <ol class="text">For women, if you give birth to a child, you are the child’s biological parent and so under the law you have the automatic legal right to care for that child unless (1) you have chosen to give up your parental rights through adoption <em>OR</em> (2) the state limited or took away your parental rights for a certain reason.<sup><a href="#footnote-2212" id="footnote-ref-2212">[2212]</a></sup>For men, if it is scientifically proven that you are the biological father of the child (this is called paternity) or you were married to or in a domestic partnership with the mother when the child was born, then you have the automatic legal right to care for that child unless (1) you have chosen to give up your parental rights through adoption <em>OR</em> (2) the state limited or took away your parental rights for a certain reason.<sup><a href="#footnote-2213" id="footnote-ref-2213">[2213]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text"><a id="FC_II_GPsRights"></a><span class="emphasisitalic"><em>For Grandparents:</em></span> Under the law, grandparents do NOT have any automatic legal rights to see or care for their grandchildren. In other words, just because your biological child has a child of his or her own does NOT mean you have any legal right to care for or make decisions about that grandchild.<sup><a href="#footnote-2214" id="footnote-ref-2214">[2214]</a></sup>But a grandparent CAN make informal or formal arrangements to take care of or see their grandchildren. </p>
                <ol class="text">Informally, absent any legal restrictions due to your criminal background, you MAY be able to make arrangements with your grandchild’s caregiver or parent(s) to spend time with your grandchild.If an informal arrangement isn’t possible, then a grandparent could ask a judge in court for custody or visitation with their grandchildren.In family court, a grandparent can join an ongoing case involving the grandchildren and ask for custody or visitation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2215" id="footnote-ref-2215">[2215]</a></sup>  For more information on Family Court, see PG. 821In probate court, a grandparent can start a case or join on ongoing case and request permanent or temporary guardianship of their grandchildren is a parent is UNABLE to take care of the child. For more information on Probate Court, see PG 827.In dependency court, a grandparent can ask the judge and the county’s Child Protective Services (CPS) to take care of their grandchild(ren) when a child has been removed from their parents’ care due to abuse or neglect allegations. For more information on Dependency Court, see PG. 835.</ol>
                <p class="text">Again, whether or not a grandparent will be able to get legal custody of their grandchildren through a formal court case in family court, probate court or dependency court will all depend on what a judge decides is in the best interest of the child(ren).

                <h4 class="sidebox">Examples of Court Orders</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Examples of court orders include Personal Conduct No-Contact Orders, Restraining Orders, and Criminal Protective Orders. For full definitions of each of these types of orders, see the “Key Terms” section of this Chapter, beginning on PG. 792.</p>
                <p class="text">A court order is a legal decision by a judge requiring something. It could affect your ability to reconnect with your child, so it is very important to know about them. A court order could impact you in the following ways:</p>

                <p class="text">Court orders are very important because they may explain your rights and responsibilities with your child—including when and how you are allowed to visit and contact the child. If you break a court order, then you could ruin your ability to reconnect with your child. Why? By violating the court order, you could face civil or criminal consequences that could prohibit you from contacting your child at all. Also, breaking a court order is a violation of the law as well as a violation of supervision. If you want to change a court order, you need to go to the court where the order is from and ask about the process to change it.</p>

                <p class="sidebox">Even if you were served with court papers while in prison/jail, it is best to get a new copy of the court order once you get out to make sure that you have all the most up-to-date papers.</p>
                <p class="text">IF YOU WERE SERVED WITH COURT PAPERS (before, during, or after your incarceration), check the papers to see if they include court orders that limit your custody and/or visitation rights with your child OR limit your ability to contact your child and/or your child’s other parent or current caregiver (<em>for grandparents,</em> the child’s caregiver might be your child, your grandchild’s other parent, or someone else). IF YOU ARE NOT SURE IF THERE ARE ANY COURT ORDERS, you can find out by contacting the clerk in the local county court <strong>where your child’s case is going on</strong>. You can usually call the clerk’s office by phone or go in person when the clerk’s office is open. Ask for copies of ALL the court orders in the case. Usually, a court order will say “court order” or “order” on the paperwork.To figure out if there is a case in court that involves your child and more information on this question, see <strong>Step 4</strong> on PG. 802 below. </p>
                <h4 class="step">Find out if there are any CONDITIONS OF PAROLE, PROBATION, OR OTHER TYPE OF COMMUNITY SUPERVISION that could limit or stop you from contacting your child and/or your child’s caregiver. </h4>
                <p class="text">If you are on parole, probation, or some other type of community supervision, you must get to know and follow ALL of the terms and conditions of your supervision. This includes any rules about whom you <em>can and cannot contact</em>, places where you <em>can and cannot travel, move, live, or visit.</em> These conditions can impact your ability to see or visit your child(ren)—so be aware of them BEFORE you start contacting or visiting them. If you want to change any conditions of supervision, read about the process for your type of community supervision in the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER of this guide: see PG. 175 (state parole); 204 (PRCS); 195 (Mandatory Supervision), 195 (informal probation), 200 (formal probation), 219 (Federal Supervised Release or Federal Probation). <span class="emphasisitalic">Until and unless a supervision condition is changed through the legal process, you should ALWAYS FOLLOW IT!</span>You my also be able to request a <strong>travel pass</strong> from your parole or probation officer to travel beyond where you are normally allowed to go. You may need a travel pass to attend a court hearing or visit with family members or friends for your case. For more information about travel restrictions and other conditions of supervision, see PG. 130 in the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER. For more information about protective, no-contact, and restraining orders, see also PG. 811.</p>

                <p class="text">If you do not already know where you child is, the next step is to locate your child—so long as there are no court orders or conditions of your supervision that prevent you from contacting your child or child’s caregiver.You will need to know the location of your child and child’s caregiver if you want to contact that child or “serve” the caregiver with any court papers, if you open a case. (To “serve” someone with court papers means to give proper legal documentation and notification about a court case to certain required people.)</p>

If you want more custody or visitation, you may need to ask the judge to change this court order.IF CPS IS INVOLVED IN YOUR CHILD’S CASE, ask the clerk at the <strong>dependency court</strong> in the county where your child lives for any <strong>court orders</strong>.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2221" id="footnote-ref-2221">[2221]</a></sup> You can also ask your county social worker and/or the dependency court judge for:</p>

Each of the three family-related courts in California has different powers, different rules, and different procedures that you need to be aware of before going to court.Exactly how your record will impact your request for greater custody and visitation rights will depend on <strong>the court your case is in</strong> and <strong>the exact conviction(s)</strong> on your record. Some convictions will completely prevent you as a parent or a grandparent from getting custody or visitation of your child or grandchild. For more information on the impact of specific convictions, see PG. 797.You may also consider asking a judge for VISITATION before you ask for full CUSTODY.

                <p class="textbox">In general, if you are the child’s parent, it is usually <strong>easier to get visitation rights with your child at first, rather than full custody</strong> after a period of incarceration. California has a strong public policy of supporting parent-child relationships and allowing visits unless they will be harmful to the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2222" id="footnote-ref-2222">[2222]</a></sup></sup> Asking a judge for visitation rights with your child—and then allowing for some time to show that the visits are going well—can be a great first step to getting custody. Through visitation with your child, you can show a judge that you are responsible, have a good relationship with your child, and eventually request greater custody rights.</p>

                <p class="text">There are so many different reasons that courts get involved in family matters. Examples of when courts get involved include cases of divorce or legal separation; cases about paternity/parentage; disagreements about custody, visitation, or child support; when one or both parents are no longer able to care for a child because they are sick, disabled, incarcerated, or passed away; or the court is supervising a child’s care due to allegations of abuse or neglect.In most cases, incarceration will affect your relationship with your family, and the courts may end up getting involved to decide who should have the legal right to make decisions about your child or grandchild, and who should be able to visit or care for your child or grandchild. While you are/were incarcerated, it’s possible that there were changes in your child’s care that had nothing to do with your actual conviction, but the courts got involved either because there was already an open case about the child, someone asked the court to get involved, OR the county’s Child Protective Services (CPS) deemed it necessary for the court to oversee the care of your child because of abuse or neglect allegations.If a court case is opened about the care of your child, it is important to know that everything in your criminal record will be available to the judge in that case. But the judge doesn’t look only at your criminal record; s/he looks at your record as one factor among MANY factors about whom is best suited to care for your child, and what is in the child’s “best interest.” To learn about the convictions that may ban you from reunifying with a child, see the chart on PG. 797.

                <p class="text">It depends—but it can never hurt your case. We recommend cleaning up your criminal record in case there is any misinformation or mistakes that could unfavorable affect your case in family court. Also, there could be updates that would look more favorable in family court such as expungement and dismissals.

                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint Clean Up Your Criminal Record &amp; Get Convictions Expunged</h4>
                <p class="textbox">If possible, it is recommended that you get your conviction expunged (“dismissed”) under California Penal Code Section 1203.4—or that you clean up your criminal record in other ways—<em>before</em> trying to get custody of a child in dependency court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2239" id="footnote-ref-2239">[2239]</a></sup>Expungement does NOT remove the conviction from your criminal record, but it has many benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-2240" id="footnote-ref-2240">[2240]</a></sup> For example, cleaning up your record and getting convictions expunged can only help you in trying to get custody, guardianship, or reunite with your child, because it will show the judge that you are committed to making positive changes in your life and can take on greater caregiving responsibilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-2241" id="footnote-ref-2241">[2241]</a></sup> Some judges (but not all) will even treat an expunged conviction <em>the same</em> as a criminal record exemption—meaning they’ll excuse the conviction in deciding that child can live with you as a guardian through dependency court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2242" id="footnote-ref-2242">[2242]</a></sup></sup> For more information about expungement and other ways to clean up your criminal record, read the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</p>

                <p class="text">There are two types of protective orders (also called “stay-away”, “no-contact”, and “restraining” orders) that could be in place against you:</p>
                <ol class="text">A protective order could be a <span class="emphasisitalic">condition of your supervision</span>, required by parole, probation, or some other type of community supervision) AND/OR A protective order could be <span class="emphasisitalic">required by a court</span> (put in place by a judge in a criminal court and/or civil court).<sup><a href="#footnote-2243" id="footnote-ref-2243">[2243]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">In either case, you MUST follow the protective order.<strong> While following the protective order, you can still challenge, fight or appeal it!</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2244" id="footnote-ref-2244">[2244]</a></sup><strong> Read the question on PG. 812 to learn how.PLEASE NOTE: </strong>It’s important to get to know the SPECIFICS of any orders preventing you from contacting another person. For example, a protective order/ “no-contact” condition may prevent you from contacting the caregiver or other parent of your child or grandchild; but this protective order may<em> not</em> apply to your child or grandchild, <em>unless it specifically says so</em>. This can create a situation where, for example, you <em>are</em> allowed to contact your child, but you <em>cannot</em> arrange for a visit with your child because you are <em>not</em> allowed to contact your child’s caregiver or the other parent. </p>

                <p class="text">If you violate a court’s protective order or a “no-contact” condition of your supervision that forbids you from contacting another person, you could be fined and/or re-incarcerated for violating the court order or the conditions of your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-2245" id="footnote-ref-2245">[2245]</a></sup> <strong>While following the protective order, you can still challenge, fight or appeal it! </strong>Read the next question on PG. 812 to learn how.Again, it is important to get to know the SPECIFICS of any protective orders or “no-contact” conditions against you so that you do not violate them.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You might have protective and restraining orders against you from both <em>criminal</em> and <em>civil</em> courts, each with different conditions or requirements. So what rules should you follow? Answer: the criminal court order! A protective order from <em>criminal court</em> is stronger than a civil restraining order from family, probate, dependency, or any other civil court. If you have multiple orders against you from different courts, you MUST follow the criminal protective order.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2246" id="footnote-ref-2246">[2246]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>
                <p class="text">It is also important to know about any conditions or orders against you, because if you go to court to ask for greater rights with your child (for example, increased custody or visitation), the judge will consider any protective or restraining orders against you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2247" id="footnote-ref-2247">[2247]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If your criminal case involved domestic violence or child abuse, then it is possible that the judge gave your child a protective order against you. If your child has a protective order against you, do NOT contact your child. </p>

                <p class="text">In addition to “no-contact” conditions (read more on PG. 811), you may have travel restrictions placed on you by parole or probation that limit your ability to reconnect with your child or grandchild.<strong>Travel Restrictions </strong>could make it difficult for you to <em>visit</em> your child or grandchild, especially if he or she lives in another county. If you have limits on where or how far you can travel, you should talk to your parole agent or probation officer and request a <strong><em>travel pass</em></strong>—and make sure you get <span class="emphasisitalic">approval in writing</span>! Alternatively, you can arrange with family, friends, a case manager or mentor, parole officer, or through the court (by requesting a change in the conditions of your supervision) for your child or grandchild to come visit you. Always check with your parole agent or probation officer if you are unsure if you have any travel restrictions. <strong>Transfer Restrictions</strong>: There may also be limitations on your ability to transfer your parole location to certain counties for a number of reasons—and you should get to know these limitations BEFORE you attempt to move, visit, or contact your child or grandchild. Again, it is always best to follow a condition while appealing it rather than violate that condition. Speak to your parole agent or probation officer about your conditions so that you are clear where you can go and where you cannot go.</p>

                <p class="text">This section will explain the three courts in California that make legal decisions about family issues and the care of children. Just because your situation <em>seems to fit into the description of cases that happen in one type of court…</em>does not mean the case will definitely be heard and decided by a judge in that court. Family law cases can be long, complicated, and difficult to navigate. Every case is different and every county handles cases dealing with family and children a little bit differently. It can even vary by<em> judge</em> within the <em>same</em> county!<span class="emphasisitalic">But don’t let this overwhelm you.</span> There are people you can contact to get help with your family law situation so you do not have figure things out alone:</p>
                <ol class="text">First, there are <strong>Family Law/Self-Help Centers</strong> in every county that can help you decide which court to go to, where to file your forms, and what kinds of documents to show as evidence.Second, you can also read this Chapter and call <strong>Root &amp; Rebound’s</strong> <strong>Reentry Hotline</strong> (any Friday, 9AM – 5PM, at phone number 510-279-4662) for more information about <em>reunifying with your children</em> or working through a family law case when you have a criminal record.

                <p class="text">There are 3 different courts in California that make decisions about family matters and the care of children: <span class="emphasisitalic">probate court</span>, <span class="emphasisitalic">juvenile court</span>, and <span class="emphasisitalic">family court</span>.It is important to understand the basics of all three courts so you know the best place to go to restore or establish your rights as a parent, grandparent, caregiver, or guardian.<span class="emphasisheavy">Here are the 3 courts and what you need to know:</span><span class="emphasisitalic">(1) Family court</span> handles cases about <strong>divorce</strong>, <strong>child support</strong>, <strong>paternity/parentage</strong>, and SOME <strong>child custody and visitation</strong> cases.<span class="emphasisitalic">(2) Probate court</span> handles “probate guardianship” cases. Individuals who want to become a child’s legal guardian, such as relatives or family friends, may file guardianship petitions in this court for temporary or permanent guardianship. This does <em>not</em> end the parent’s rights, but instead puts them on <em>pause.</em><span class="emphasisitalic">(3) Juvenile court</span> includes two divisions: <em>dependency</em> and <em>delinquency</em>.</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Dependency court</span> handles cases of child abuse and neglect, also called CPS cases. The government agency Child Protective Services (CPS) opens a case in dependency court if someone reports that a child may be at risk. (Note: CPS can have different names in each county of California; it is often called the Department of Child and Family Services). If a child is at risk at home, the dependency court may take over custody of the child. A child is sometimes called a “ward” of the dependency court.NOTE: <span class="emphasisitalic">Delinquency court</span> makes decisions in cases where a child (under the age of 18) is arrested and charged with a crime. This court may send the young person to juvenile hall as a punishment for breaking the law. For more information on delinquency court, visit the California Courts’ website at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-delinquency.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-delinquency.htm</a>. We do not go into detail about delinquency court in this guide because the guide is focused on people in the adult criminal justice system and in reentry from prisons and jails.</ol>

                <p class="text">Yes – for any court hearing involving your child, you can <em>ask</em> the judge to be transported and it is up to the judge whether or not to order your transportation for the hearing; and for certain types of cases, you have the <em>automatic right</em> to be transported.<em>As an incarcerated parent</em>, you have the <span class="emphasisheavy">RIGHT TO REQUEST</span> transportation to:</p>
                <ol class="text">A court hearing in a dependency court case; andHearings in other courts (such as family court, probate court, and juvenile delinquency court) that could affect your parental rights (including cases about custody and visitation, divorce, paternity/parentage cases, guardianship, child support, etc.).<sup><a href="#footnote-2261" id="footnote-ref-2261">[2261]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">In these cases, the <em>judge</em> decides whether or not to grant your request.<sup><a href="#footnote-2262" id="footnote-ref-2262">[2262]</a></sup>As an incarcerated parent, you have <span class="emphasisheavy">THE AUTOMATIC RIGHT</span> <strong>to be transported</strong> <strong>to court</strong> for a few specific reasons:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Jurisdictional and dispositional hearings in dependency court: </strong>Jurisdictional and Dispositional hearings are formal meetings in front of a judge once a case has begun in juvenile dependency court. At the jurisdiction hearing the judge will decide whether the allegations in the petition are true. If the judge decides the allegations are true, the court will take authority over your child. This is called jurisdiction in the law; that is why the hearing is called the jurisdiction hearing. Disposition is the part of the case where the judge will decide what you should do to make things better for your family and your child. This is called the reunification plan.<strong>Hearings that seek to terminate their parental rights:</strong>Hearings that seek to terminate parental rights are formal meetings in front of a judge about ending the right a parent has to see and care for their child. If a parent's rights are terminated, that parent can no longer make legal, medical or general life decisions for the child. In the eyes of the law, the child is no longer that parent's child. Examples of the types of cases that could end a parent's right include: adoption, petition terminating the parental rights of alleged father, or a petition for emancipation.</ol>
                <p class="text">Under state law, the judge should <em>automatically</em> make an order for you to be transported to these types of hearings. The court MUST send a copy of the “transport order” to the warden or sheriff of your facility at least 15 days before the date you need transportation. If you do not receive this order, or if you want to be transported to court for other dependency court hearings, you can write to the court to request such an order, or ask the attorney representing you to request one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2263" id="footnote-ref-2263">[2263]</a></sup></sup><a id="FamilyChildren_SupervisionReconnect"></a><a id="_Toc308433778"></a><a id="_Toc308701458"></a><a id="_Toc309293923"></a></p>

                <p class="text">Yes, you have <em>the right to request visitations</em> while you are incarcerated. However, we recommend trying to come to an informal agreement with the child’s caregiver for visits to your facility. Filing a lawsuit is a timely and costly process that can cause confrontation in your family. If you have an informal visiting schedule then you are more likely to have an amicable relationship with the child’s guardian. Once you have a successful visit or two, you can ask the caregiver for a <em>reasonable schedule for visits</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2264" id="footnote-ref-2264">[2264]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Be sure to put your agreement in writing—It can be a simple letter from you stating what you have agreed. Keep a copy. Then keep written records of how your arrangement is working out over time. </p>
                <p class="text">If you cannot agree on an informal visitation plan with your child’s caregiver, then you can request visitation through court. If that is your situation, you can follow the steps for starting or joining a case in any of the three family-related courts (see PG 817 or how to start or join a case). Grandparents, because they do not have any automatic right to visitation, cannot ask the court for visitation with their grandchild while they are incarcerated, but may be able to set up an informal agreement with the child’s parent or caregiver to come visit them.</p>

                <p class="text">A family court judge who is deciding whether or not to give you custody or visitation rights (meaning rights to <em>see, care for, and/or make decisions</em> for your child or grandchild) must find that it would be in the “<span class="emphasisheavy">best interest of the child” </span>to do so. The factors a judge will look at in deciding what is in the “best interest of the child” are on PG. 809; your criminal record is <em>just one factor</em> the judge will consider.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2267" id="footnote-ref-2267">[2267]</a></sup> </sup><span class="emphasisitalic"><em>For Parents:</em> </span>The law assumes that it is in the “best interest of the child” to have a stable, consistent relationship with both parents through custody and/or visitation. BUT if one or both parents can’t provide the care and stability that your child needs—or if there is a specific reason to believe that having contact with the parent(s) would be harmful to your child—then the judge will consider other options or even limit or cut off contact between the parent(s) and their child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2268" id="footnote-ref-2268">[2268]</a></sup><a id="FC_V_Grandparentsrightstorequestcorv"></a><span class="emphasisitalic"><em>For Grandparents:</em></span> A Grandparent may request to become the child’s primary caregiver, getting <em>custody</em> of the child, OR a judge might order <em>visitation rights</em> under certain circumstances.</p>
                <ol class="text"><em>If you are a grandparent seeking CUSTODY of your grandchild:</em> As a grandparent, you cannot ask for custody of your grandchild if both parents still have full rights to the child. However, if BOTH of your grandchild’s PARENTS have lost or ended their parental rights, you can then ask for custody of your grandchild by asking to become the child’s <strong>legal guardian</strong> in probate court (see PG. 827 OR in dependency court if CPS is involved in the child’s case (see PG. 835 OR by adopting the child (see PG. 849).<em>If you are a grandparent seeking VISITATION with your grandchild:</em> Under state law, a grandparent <em>cannot</em> ask a judge in family court for visitation with a grandchild if the parents of the child are still married, <em>UNLESS</em> one of the following is true:The parents are living apart from each other;One parent’s location has been unknown (for at least a month);One of the parents joins your “petition” (a request filed with the court) to ask for visitation—which means the parent with custody is supporting your request to the judge to have visits;The child doesn’t live with either parent;The grandchild has been adopted by a stepparent.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2269" id="footnote-ref-2269">[2269]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">If one or more of these factors are TRUE, you can ask a judge in family court for visitation with your grandchild. The judge will then balance <em>the following factors</em> to make a decision:</p>

                <p class="text">Because parents are given priority in making decisions about their child’s care, a family court judge will probably deny your request for visitation if:</p>

                <p class="text">Yes. As stated on PG. 797 your criminal record can be one of many factors a family court judge will consider in deciding what is in the “best interest of the child.”For some conviction offenses, the law will <em>automatically ban you</em> from reconnecting with a child or grandchild. For other convictions and criminal history that <em>do not completely prevent you</em> from having custody or visitation with your child, a family court judge will look at this history as one factor of many in deciding what custody and/or visitation plan is in the “best interest of the child.” For example, if you have past convictions for child abuse, first-degree murder of the child’s other parent, or being a 290-sex offender registrant where the victim was a minor, a judge is unlikely to grant full custody or unsupervised visitation.

                <ol class="text"><strong>Write down ALL of your efforts to see your child or grandchild and keep the document in a safe place in case you go to court.</strong> By recording the date and times you called can help show to the court that you have taken the process of connecting with your child/grandchild seriously. This may help you if the child’s caregiver has been difficult in allowing you to visit. <strong>Stay in contact with your child/grandchild.</strong> Whether you are incarcerated or not, try to stay a parental figure as much as you can by remembering dates important to your child and asking your child’s caregiver or others about the child.<strong>Start slowly with visits.</strong> If you and the other parent (or caregiver) feel better about your reconnecting with your child slowly, you might start with short visits in the other parent’s (or caregiver’s) home. Then over time, if you build a record of positive visits, you can discuss making your visits longer and more frequent.<strong>You can make other requests of the other parent (or caregiver), in addition to visits.</strong> You can ask to call and write to your child, to receive photos and report cards, to stay updated on school progress and health issues, and to be asked about important decisions.<strong>Keep written records of everything.</strong> Put any agreements in writing, and always keep an extra copy safe. As your visits continue, keep written records of how things are going.</ol>
                <p class="text">NOTE: A case plan is created by Child Protective Services (CPS) when it gets involved in a case regarding your child. The case plan sets out the steps you must take to get your child back.

If you are the child’s parent and want to get custody or visitation, you will generally need to go to family court (PG. 821) or juvenile dependency court if there is a CPS case involving your child.

                <p class="text">You would go to probate court to end a guardianship if someone else (other than the child’s parents) was given guardianship of your child while you were incarcerated. If a judge in probate court formally created the guardianship, then you have to go to probate court to end it. </p>
                <h5 class="question">If I have been incarcerated and someone else is the guardian of my child, what are my legal rights as a parent?</h5>
                <p class="text">Guardianship does NOT end your parental rights; it only puts your parental rights on hold while the guardian has custody of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2284" id="footnote-ref-2284">[2284]</a></sup> </sup>This allows the guardian(s) to make all the decisions about caring for the child that a parent would make, without permanently cutting off the parents’ rights to ask for custody of their child back in the future.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2285" id="footnote-ref-2285">[2285]</a></sup></sup><span class="emphasisheavy">Parent’s Rights:</span>The child’s legal or biological parents still have certain <em>rights</em> for their child during the guardianship:</p>
                <ol class="text">The children in a guardianship are still considered legally and biologically “related” to their parents (the parents’ rights are not terminated);The judge or the guardian of the child can allow the parents or other relatives to visit with the children in a guardianship;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2286" id="footnote-ref-2286">[2286]</a></sup></sup>When the judge appoints a guardian to have custody of a child, the judge may also give visitation rights to the child’s parent(s) and/or sibling(s) to visit the childIf the judge orders visitation, the child’s guardian must allow these visits to take place. If there is no court order for visitation, the guardian has the right to decide whether the child may visit with his/her parent(s) or other relatives.<strong> </strong>So if you don't have a court order and the guardian is not letting you see your child, you might need to go to Probate Court to ask the judge for visitation. <em>Please Note:</em> You will need to ask for visitation from <em>the same probate court</em> that appointed your child’s current guardian, which may be in a different county from where you live. You will also need to use that county’s own specific probate court forms to request visitation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2287" id="footnote-ref-2287">[2287]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <ol class="text">Whether the guardianship is in the “<em>best interest of the child</em>.” In all child custody and visitation cases, including ones for probate guardianship, the judge will consider such factors as: The health and safety of the child, Any history of abuse by the parent or person seeking custody, Habitual or continued substance abuse by the parent, The criminal record of the non-parent petitioning for guardianship, ANDWhether the child will be raised in stable and loving environment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2293" id="footnote-ref-2293">[2293]</a></sup>Whether giving custody to someone other than the child’s parent(s) would <em>harm the child</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2294" id="footnote-ref-2294">[2294]</a></sup></sup> The goal is to make sure the child is raised in a safe, stable, and loving environment.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2295" id="footnote-ref-2295">[2295]</a></sup></sup></ol>

We explain what the judge will look at about your record, including what positives can help weigh against your criminal history.In probate court, the judge will look at the following:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>PAST CONVICTIONS:</strong> The judge can consider all of your convictions when deciding whether to appoint you as a guardian. But certain types of convictions are more likely than others to affect your chances of being appointed as a guardian.<sup><a href="#footnote-2296" id="footnote-ref-2296">[2296]</a></sup> Although the judge will consider all of your past convictions, the convictions that are viewed most negatively are child abuse and/or domestic violence; registered sex offenses where the victim was a child; and rape or murder of the child’s other parent.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2297" id="footnote-ref-2297">[2297]</a></sup></sup><strong>RESTRAINING ORDERS:</strong> The judge will also consider any restraining or protective orders against you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2298" id="footnote-ref-2298">[2298]</a></sup></sup><strong>CPS HISTORY:</strong> The judge will look at any history with Child Protective Services (CPS).<sup><a href="#footnote-2299" id="footnote-ref-2299">[2299]</a></sup><strong>DRUG OR ALCOHOL ABUSE:</strong> Finally, a judge will consider any history of drug or alcohol abuse (whether or not you have any convictions that were related to that drug or alcohol abuse) to decide if it is in the child’s best interest to make you his/her guardian.<sup><a href="#footnote-2300" id="footnote-ref-2300">[2300]</a></sup> The judge may require you to do drug or alcohol tests, or make an order that requires you NOT to use any drugs or alcohol. However, the probate court judge cannot deny your guardianship petition based only on the results of a positive drug/alcohol test—a dirty test is only one factor of many when deciding whether the guardianship would be in the child’s best interest.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2301" id="footnote-ref-2301">[2301]</a></sup></sup><strong>NEW CONVICTIONS:</strong> If you’ve been appointed the child’s legal guardian, the judge can remove you as guardian (meaning, <em>end</em> your guardianship rights) if you are convicted of a felony, regardless of whether the underlying offense happened before or after you became the child’s legal guardian in court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2302" id="footnote-ref-2302">[2302]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <ol class="text">A caregiver can sign a Power of Attorney for a Minor Child in front of a notary (see the side box about notary services) that gives you physical “custody” of the child and lets you make decisions about the child's education and medical care. Learn more about notary services on PG. 32.Make sure you have the child’s health insurance information. If you want to add the child to <em>your</em> health insurance, you will probably need a court-ordered guardianship (technically called a “guardianship of the person”) since most insurance companies will require a court order.The parents can cancel the Power of Attorney at any time. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2303" id="footnote-ref-2303">[2303]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <ol class="text">If the child will remain in California, the person taking care of the child can complete and sign a Caregiver's Authorization Affidavit.If you are a relative of the child, this document allows you to enroll the child in school and make decisions about the child’s medical care. If you are not a relative, you will only be able to enroll the child in school and make medical decisions for the child that are <em>related to school</em> (like immunizations or physical exams required for school enrollment).The Caregiver's Authorization Affidavit is NOT an official court form.The parents do not have to sign the Caregiver's Authorization Affidavit.The parents can cancel the Caregiver’s Authorization Affidavit at any time.If the child is no longer living with the caregiver, the affidavit is not valid. The caregiver must notify the school and health care provider if the child is no longer living with him or her.There are certain things that you will NOT be able to do or you will have a lot of difficulty even if you have this form and a notarized letter. For example, it may be hard for you to get medical insurance for the child unless you are the legal guardian. Most insurance companies will not allow you to add the minor to your insurance unless you have a court order making you the guardian.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2304" id="footnote-ref-2304">[2304]</a></sup></sup> </ol>

                <ol class="text">This would be an agreement between you and the child’s parents.

                <h3>What is juvenile dependency court?</h3>
                <p class="sidebox">How is <em>juvenile dependency court</em> different from <em>juvenile delinquency court</em>?Juvenile delinquency courts are for cases where a child is charged with committing a crime. Juvenile dependency courts, on the other hand, are for cases where a parent or caregiver is suspected of abusing or neglecting a child. Sometimes, children are involved in both of these courts at the same time—if they are <em>both </em>being charge with a crime <em>and</em> there is a case of suspected child abuse or neglect by their parents. If your child is being charged with a crime, see the next section on juvenile delinquency on PG. 847.</p>
                <p class="text">The local county Child Protective Services (CPS) opens a case in juvenile dependency court when a child’s parent(s) or caregivers are suspected of <em>abuse </em>or<em> neglect</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2309" id="footnote-ref-2309">[2309]</a></sup> </p>
                <h5 class="question">When would CPS get involved?</h5>
                <p class="text">CPS gets involved in a child’s life when a parent has been violent with, abused, or neglected a child, or if the child tests positive for drugs at birth.<sup><a href="#footnote-2310" id="footnote-ref-2310">[2310]</a></sup> When CPS gets involved, they may open a case in juvenile dependency court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2311" id="footnote-ref-2311">[2311]</a></sup> Whether or not they open a case in dependency court depends on if CPS removed the child from his or her home. Once CPS removes the child, a case is started in juvenile dependency court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2312" id="footnote-ref-2312">[2312]</a></sup> In most cases, the parent(s) will have the opportunity to get their child back if they meet certain requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-2313" id="footnote-ref-2313">[2313]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question">What is considered child abuse?</h5>
                <p class="text">Under the law, abuse may be physical harm, sexual abuse, cruel or unreasonable punishment, using drugs while pregnant, and/or neglect of a child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2314" id="footnote-ref-2314">[2314]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question"><a id="_Toc302383998"></a><a id="_Toc304119089"></a><a id="_Toc312427116"></a><a id="_Toc314389728"></a>Can CPS remove my child from my care just because I have a criminal record?</h5>
                <p class="text">No. Just having a criminal record is not enough for Child Protective Services (CPS) or a judge to take your child away—there has to be some connection between your conviction and a risk of harm to your child. For example, a conviction for child abuse, certain violent felonies, or using drug or alcohol in a way that put your child at risk could cause CPS or the judge to remove your child from your care.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2315" id="footnote-ref-2315">[2315]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc317247525"></a><a id="_Toc448153624"></a>Why would i go to juvenile dependency court?</h3>
                <p class="text">You would go to Juvenile Dependency Court because of one of the following situations:</p>
                <ol class="text">CPS is involved in investigating an allegation that your child was abused or neglected; orYou are, or want to be, the child’s foster parent. </ol>

                <p class="text">You would go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with your child or grandchild if CPS is involved in investigating an allegation of child abuse or neglect. As a parent, that could mean your child was taken away from you or the child’s caregiver. You would attend juvenile court proceedings to try and resolve the allegations of abuse and neglect.<sup><a href="#footnote-2316" id="footnote-ref-2316">[2316]</a></sup> A grandparent could be involved either because the grandparent is accused of abuse or neglect or the grandparent wants to become the child’s guardian while the investigation by CPS continues.<sup><a href="#footnote-2317" id="footnote-ref-2317">[2317]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc317247528"></a><a id="_Toc448153627"></a>How can a judge’s decision in juvenile dependency court affect my rights as a <em>parent</em>?</h3>
                <p class="text">A judge’s decision could either take away or limit your rights as a parent. Unless the case is dismissed, meaning the allegations of child abuse or neglect are found to be untrue, your parental rights will be affected in dependency court. Keep reading for more information on different kinds of judge’s orders. If your child is part of a CPS case in juvenile dependency court, the judge could make orders that:</p>
                <ol class="text">Place your child with relatives, foster parents, or a court-appointed legal guardian; and/orGive you visitation rights; and/orGive you a case plan that requires you to attending parenting classes, counseling, or other programs, and/orEnd your parental rights if you are unable to successfully complete your case plan within 18 months.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2318" id="footnote-ref-2318">[2318]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Just like any court’s decisions about the custody of a child, a dependency court judge must decide what is in the “best interest of the child.” This means the judge will make decisions that affect your parental rights to care for, live with, see, and make decisions for your child—and can even reduce or take away some of these rights completely. Most of the time, you will have a year to complete your requirements if you keep making progress. But if your child is under three years old, you will have only six months to show that you are committed to finishing up everything.<sup><a href="#footnote-2319" id="footnote-ref-2319">[2319]</a></sup><strong>Below we briefly describe some of the caregiving arrangements that a judge can order through a case in juvenile dependency court: </strong></p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Long-Term Guardianship: </strong>This is where the court places the child with a relative if family reunification services are unsuccessful. The child will stay with the guardian until he or she is 18.<sup><a href="#footnote-2320" id="footnote-ref-2320">[2320]</a></sup> See more on PG. 830. Guardianships can also be set up through probate court if CPS is <em>not </em>involved. See more on Guardianships on PG. 830.<strong>Foster case:</strong> This is where a child is placed with one or two “foster parents”—people who the State has licensed, trained and approved to care for children in their home. However, foster parents have fewer rights than legal guardians or biological parents, so the judge and Child Protective Services (CPS) will continue to be legally responsible for making decisions about the child.See more on PG. 842. <strong>De Facto Parent:</strong> This is where a non-parent who has been taking care of a child can get parental legal rights IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE TRUE:The child is a “dependent” or “ward” of the juvenile dependency court (meaning the dependency court has an open case about that child); ANDYou are currently or have been taking care of the child every day; ANDYou have been acting as the child’s parent; ANDYou are meeting or have met the child’s needs for food, shelter, clothing, as well as care and affection.<sup><a href="#footnote-2321" id="footnote-ref-2321">[2321]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">PLEASE NOTE: No law says exactly what a “de facto parent” needs to do f	or this arrangement to be approved by a judge in court. Judges make this decision based on other court cases and their own court rules!<sup><a href="#footnote-2322" id="footnote-ref-2322">[2322]</a></sup> For more information on “de facto parent” status, see Appendix D, PG. 887.</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Adoption:</strong> This is where a non-parent adopts a child because the dependency court has ended the rights of the parents. This is different from a guardianship, which puts parental rights on hold. For more information on adoption, see PG. 849.</ol>
                <p class="text">To learn more about how a judge makes this decision about where to place a child, see below on PG. 838.<a id="_Toc308433802"></a><a id="_Toc308701482"></a><a id="_Toc309293929"></a><a id="_Toc312427114"></a><a id="_Toc314389726"></a> For more information on the difference between guardianship, adoption and foster care see PG. 828.</p>
                <h5 class="question"><a id="_Toc312427117"></a><a id="_Toc314389729"></a>How will a dependency court judge decide where to place a child?</h5>
                <p class="text"><strong>TO PLACE BACK WITH THE PARENT(S): </strong>The judge will decide whether or not to let the child return home with the parents if, given the situation presented to the judge by CPS and the parents, it is safe for the child to return home with the parents.<sup><a href="#footnote-2323" id="footnote-ref-2323">[2323]</a></sup> This is a case-by-case analysis. <strong>TO NOT PLACE WITH THE PARENT(S): </strong>If the child returning home with one or both parents is <em>not</em> an option, then the judge in dependency court will decide where to place a child based on what is in the best interest of that child (learn more about this legal standard “best interest of the child” on PG. 809).The judge can place the child in a legal guardianship so long as:</p>
                <ol class="text">The parent and child (if old enough to meaningfully comment) agree; AND The judge finds that the guardianship is in the child’s best interest; ANDThe guardian meets the same basic requirements as a guardian has to meet in probate court (see PG. 830) for the requirements for guardians)<sup><a href="#footnote-2324" id="footnote-ref-2324">[2324]</a></sup>—BUT! A guardian in dependency court has to go through criminal background checks as a foster parent.<sup><a href="#footnote-2325" id="footnote-ref-2325">[2325]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">However, if the judge decides not to place the child in a legal guardianship or there are no family or friends to ask the judge and CPS to care for the child, then the child will be considered a “dependent” or “ward” of the court and placed in foster care.<sup><a href="#footnote-2326" id="footnote-ref-2326">[2326]</a></sup> Keep reading this section for more information on foster care. </p>

                <p class="text">As we explained on PG. 842, a child is placed in foster care when Child Protective Services takes custody of a child due to a concern that the child’s parents or caregivers are unable, unwilling or unfit to care for the child. The goal of foster care is to reunify with their parent(s) or guardian or find another suitable permanent living arrangement. CPS files a juvenile dependency petition in dependency court when the child is removed from his/her home and placed in a foster home.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2328" id="footnote-ref-2328">[2328]</a></sup></sup> You can make sure you are involved in ever step of the legal process as your child is placed in foster care.</p>

                <ol class="text">Detention HearingJurisdiction HearingDisposition HearingStatus Review HearingPermanent Plan Hearing</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">Remember!

                <h4 class="step">Third, most important for you will be the disposition hearing, where the court will decide what you need to do to reunify with your child. CPS will write a <em>case plan</em> that you must follow if you want to reunify with your child upon your release.. At this hearing you can request that the court order several ways to keep in contact with your child including:</h4>

                <h4 class="step">Finally, the court will be more likely to return your child to you during Status Review Hearings if you:</h4>

                <p class="text">If you are the child’s parent and want to reunite with your child, AND your parental rights have NOT yet been ended (“terminated”), you generally have the right to reunite with your child <em>even if</em> you have a criminal record (so long as you don’t have a conviction that automatically bans contact with your child, see PG. 797 and <em>even while</em> you are incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2331" id="footnote-ref-2331">[2331]</a></sup> Regardless of your criminal record, you will need to show that reuniting with your child will be <em>in your child’s best interest</em> and <em>will not put your child at risk of harm</em>. It will help to show the dependency court judge proof of the following:</p>
                <ol class="text">Rehabilitation: Showing evidence that you have treatment for drug or alcohol use or even parenting or counseling courses can help. Before your hearing, you should ask for any paperwork that shows the dates of your treatment or meetings you attended. You may also want to bring letters of support from your counselors.Letters of Support: These can be from case managers, teachers, family, friends, and others who know both you and your child.Proof of Housing and Income: By showing evidence of where you live and proof of where you work can also help. You may also consider showing the court a budget of how you plan to provide for both you and your child financially to show that you have thought and planned to be reunited with your child.Proof that you are successfully complying with all conditions of your probation, parole, or community supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-2332" id="footnote-ref-2332">[2332]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Other things you can do to show the judge that you are serious about reuniting with your child and are ready to have increased caregiving responsibilities and rights include the following:</p>
                <ol class="text">Visit your child as much as you can; andAddress the issues that caused Child Protective Services (CPS) and/or the court to get involved in the first place (for example, work on dealing with substance abuse, anger management, and other issues). </ol>
                <p class="text">Finally, the judge is more likely to give you <em>visitation</em> rights sooner than full <em>custody</em> rights, regardless of your criminal record. Under state law, it is generally assumed that it’s in a child’s best interest to have visits with his/her parent(s); judges are encouraged to give visitation rights to the parent(s), so long as the visits will not be harmful to the child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2333" id="footnote-ref-2333">[2333]</a></sup> To decide whether visitation is in your child’s best interest, the judge will look at things like your relationship with your child, whether your child’s other parent (or caregiver) is in favor of the visits, whether your child wants to visit with you (depending on the child’s age), and how well you and your child get along during those visits—not just whether you have a criminal record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2334" id="footnote-ref-2334">[2334]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Remember, you have a LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME to complete your dependency “case plan” requirements and reunite with your child. If your child’s dependency court case started or was happening while you were incarcerated, the clock may have already started to run during your time inside. This means you will have to work extra hard to complete all of your case plan requirements and show the judge that you’re ready to care for your child again once you get out (before your time runs out).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2335" id="footnote-ref-2335">[2335]</a></sup></strong></p>

                <p class="text">As stated in the family court section on PG. 825, You can show the judge anything that indicates that giving you custody or visitation will be in the best interests of your child. You can show the judge things like: certificates earned during incarceration, letters to and from your child, letters of support from family and friends, documents that show attendance in self-help groups, proof of employment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2336" id="footnote-ref-2336">[2336]</a></sup> However, if you have a conviction that automatically bans you from getting custody or visitation with your child, then mitigating evidence will not be considered.

                <p class="text">Foster care is a system run by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) that provides temporary homes for children who cannot live with family or a legal guardian. A child in foster care was removed from his or her home by Child Protective Services (CPS) because the child’s parents were <em>unable, unwilling or unfit</em> to care for the child. The goal of foster care is to reunify the child with his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) OR find another suitable permanent living arrangement. This may include an adoptive home, long-term guardianship, or living with a relative.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc317247545"></a><a id="_Toc448153644"></a>What is a juvenile court guardianship? </h3>
                <p class="text">Legal guardianship is a court order saying that a certain adult—someone who is not the child’s parent—is in charge of taking care of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2349" id="footnote-ref-2349">[2349]</a></sup></sup> Guardians have many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as parents do while the guardianship is in place. They can make decisions about where the child lives, the child’s health care, and where the child goes to school.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2350" id="footnote-ref-2350">[2350]</a></sup></sup> Remember! In California, there are <em>2 kinds of legal guardianships</em>: (1) <em>probate</em> guardianships and (2) <em>juvenile dependency</em> guardianships. Many guardianships are set up through the probate court, not in juvenile dependency court. If your child is NOT a dependent of the juvenile court, you may want to read about probate guardianships on PG.  827. NOTE: A guardian who was appointed through dependency court has the <em>same responsibilities</em> as a guardian appointed in probate court, although they do not have an automatic duty to provide status reports to the court at least once a year. Guardians through dependency court still have the following responsibilities. <strong><em>A guardian through dependency court is responsible for the following for the dependent child:</em></strong></p>
                <ol class="text">Health care: You can make medical decisions for the child. You can give permission for most medical and dental treatments, and for counseling or therapy. Education: You can choose the child’s school and learning program. If he/she needs special education, you can work with the school to write an individualized education program (“IEP”).Social services: You can get help for the child from programs such as Head Start, Regional Centers (for children with developmental disabilities), California Children’s Services (for children with physical disabilities or certain medical conditions), and after-school programs.Residence: You can decide where the child lives.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2351" id="footnote-ref-2351">[2351]</a></sup></sup> Financial support: You can choose to support the child by yourself; or, if you want help, you can ask for welfare, foster care payments, or other help.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2352" id="footnote-ref-2352">[2352]</a></sup></sup> Marriage: You and the court must give permission for the child to get married if he/she wants to do so while under 18.Armed forces: You can give permission for the child to join the armed forces if he/she is under 18.Driver’s License: You can give permission for the child to apply for a driver’s license. You’ll have to pay for any damage if he/she gets in an accident, and you must get insurance to cover the child. If you change your mind, you can sign a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to cancel the child’s license.Misconduct: You can be sued for money damages if the child does something wrong.Other responsibilities: The judge can ask you to take on other responsibilities. For example, the judge can set up visits for the child with his/her parents or sisters/brothers.</ol>

                <p class="text">Guardians can be grandparents, brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, other relatives, foster parents, family friends, or others who know the child. A guardian doesn’t have to be blood-related to the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2353" id="footnote-ref-2353">[2353]</a></sup></sup></p>

                <p class="text"><em>First, the bad news:</em> If the child is NOT living with you right now, before the judge can make you the child’s guardian and allow the child to live with you, the court staff (or a county social worker) must run a background check on you AND any other adults who live in your home or who will spend significant time with the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2354" id="footnote-ref-2354">[2354]</a></sup></sup> If you (or any other adult who gets checked) have a criminal record, the judge will not allow the child to live with you UNLESS you get a “criminal record exemption” from the county social service agency.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2355" id="footnote-ref-2355">[2355]</a></sup></sup> A criminal record exemption means you must get the county social service agency to excuse your conviction and not hold it against you in the process of becoming the child’s guardian through dependency court.</p>
                <h5 class="question">What convictions can I <em>NOT</em> get an “exemption” for?</h5>
                <p class="text">Unfortunately, many convictions are considered <em>“non-exemptible,”</em> which means if you or anyone in your home has a <em>non-exemptible conviction</em> on your criminal record, the judge will NOT allow the child to live with you, even if living with you would otherwise be good for the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2356" id="footnote-ref-2356">[2356]</a></sup></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Non-exemptible convictions include:</span> A FELONY conviction for child abuse, child neglect, spousal abuse, other crimes against a child (including child pornography), or for a crime involving violence (including rape, sexual assault, and homicide), and a felony conviction <em>within the last 5 years</em> for physical assault, battery, or a drug- or alcohol-related offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-2357" id="footnote-ref-2357">[2357]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: </span>BUT—and this is a big BUT—if the child is <em>already</em> living in your home, the judge can allow the child to continue living with you, <em>even if</em> you or someone else in the home has a “non-exemptible” conviction, especially if the child is doing well there.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2358" id="footnote-ref-2358">[2358]</a></sup></sup></p>

                <p class="text">The following is a brief overview of juvenile delinquency court cases. We only include the basics because Root &amp; Rebound is focused on providing information to people who are in reentry from prison and jail, and navigating legal issues with a criminal record. In general, we do not focus on situations in which a person is actively being charged with a crime in criminal or juvenile delinquency court. But because many people in reentry have children involved in the juvenile justice system, we are including a brief overview here to provide parents with some very basic information. If you have a child involved in a juvenile delinquency case, we recommend you speak with the juvenile delinquency court that is handling your child’s case, and your child’s attorney.</p>

                <p class="text">There are two types of cases that end up in juvenile delinquency court: they are called “601 petitions” and “602 petitions”.<sup><a href="#footnote-2359" id="footnote-ref-2359">[2359]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">601 petitions:</span> The county’s probation department files 601 petitions based on crimes that are only illegal when someone is a child under the age of 18. This includes things such as breaking curfew, skipping school, running away, or disobeying parents. If the court finds a child under the age of 18 guilty of one of these offenses, the child is called a “status offender.” <sup><a href="#footnote-2360" id="footnote-ref-2360">[2360]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">602 petitions:</span> The District Attorney’s office files 602 petitions based on crimes that would still be illegal even if the child were 18 years or older. These types of crimes include both felonies and misdemeanors. If the court finds the child guilty of these types of crimes, it is called an “adjudication” (instead of a “conviction,” which is the term used to describe crimes that people are found guilty of in the adult criminal court system). A child who has an “adjudication” is called a “delinquent” to describe their status under law. <sup><a href="#footnote-2361" id="footnote-ref-2361">[2361]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">In juvenile delinquency court, they have hearings called “fitness” hearings (sometimes called “waiver” hearings), where the judge decides if the child is “unfit” for juvenile delinquency court. If the child is found “unfit” for juvenile court, the child’s case will be held in adult criminal court, with adult punishments. Children can only be found “unfit” for juvenile delinquency court, and have their case sent to adult criminal court, if they were <em>14 or older</em> at the time of the alleged offense. </p>

                <p class="text">Adoption is the <em>legal process</em> of forming a legally recognized parent-child relationship when you are <em>not</em> the child's biological or birth parent. Adoptive parents have ALL the same legal rights and responsibilities that a biological parent would have had. That adoptive parent-child relationship is permanent and is seen as exactly the same as that of a birth family under the law. An adoptive parent can be a stepparent or domestic partner of one of the birth parents, a relative of the child who has been caring for the child, or someone unrelated to the child by blood.

                <p class="text">Anyone who applies to adopt a child will have to provide a lot of documentation, including a state criminal record and fingerprints that will be run though the California Department of Justice’s (CA DOJ) state database and the FBI’s federal database.<sup><a href="#footnote-2368" id="footnote-ref-2368">[2368]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">It depends on your past conviction(s) and the past conviction(s) of anyone else living in the adoptive home.<sup><a href="#footnote-2369" id="footnote-ref-2369">[2369]</a></sup> If your past conviction was related to the abuse or neglect of a child, or was for a violent offense, the judge may not allow you to adopt. If you were convicted of abuse or neglect or a violent offense, it you should talk to a lawyer about whether you will still be able to legally adopt a child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2370" id="footnote-ref-2370">[2370]</a></sup> Because the judge is determining what is in the best interest of the child, convictions related to child abuse or neglect will likely bar you from adopting a child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2371" id="footnote-ref-2371">[2371]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>&gt; Convictions that will <em>AUTOMATICALLY</em> Ban You from Adopting a Child:</strong></ol>
                <p class="text">Whether you are going through an adoption agency, family court, or juvenile dependency court, under state law you may <em>not</em> adopt a child if you have a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, any crimes against a child (including child pornography), or for a violent crime such as rape, sexual assault, or homicide).<sup><a href="#footnote-2372" id="footnote-ref-2372">[2372]</a></sup> You also may not adopt a child if you have a felony conviction within the last 5 years for physical assault, battery, or a drug- or alcohol-related offense (in other words, you will have to wait 5 years <em>after</em> the date of your conviction to be able to adopt a child in California).<sup><a href="#footnote-2373" id="footnote-ref-2373">[2373]</a></sup>So regardless of whether it is a court or an adoption agency reviewing your record, you will not be approved as an adoptive parent if one of the above bans applies.</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>&gt; Convictions that <em>MIGHT</em> Ban You from Adopting a Child:</strong></ol>
                <p class="text">The question above explained state law that <em>automatically</em> prevents people with certain convictions from adopting a child, no matter if it is a court or an adoption agency making the decision.In addition to those convictions, a family court, dependency court, and/or an adoption agency will also screen and consider the following factors about you:</p>
                <ol class="text">How you’ve dealt with difficult or stressful life situations in the past; Relationships within your family;Ability to take over the responsibility for the care, guidance, and protection of a child;Emotional flexibility and stability;Self-esteem;Coping ability;How you accept normal hazards and risks;<strong> </strong>Motivation for adoption;Your ability to have a parent-child relationship and to enjoy life with a child;Flexibility regarding your expectations of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2374" id="footnote-ref-2374">[2374]</a></sup></sup>Social background;Educational background;Financial stability;Work adjustment; andAdequacy of housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2375" id="footnote-ref-2375">[2375]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">In sum, courts and adoption agencies review every adoption application individually. Your conviction history will be one factor, but depending on your current situation and efforts at rehabilitation, you may still be able to adopt (unless you have a conviction on the list of ones that <em>automatically</em> prevent you from adopting, on PG. 797).</p>

This means that you can be the child’s biological parent but not the “legal parent,” OR you can be the child’s legal parent even if you are <em>not</em> the biological parent. There are specific legal rules for deciding whom the child’s legal parents are—in other words, rules for establishing paternity/parentage (these legal rules are also called “presumptions”).When a child is born, the woman who gives birth to the child (the child’s biological or “natural mother”) is automatically the child’s legal parent. But the child does not another legal parent until paternity/parentage is established according to these legal rules. Even if someone is the child’s biological parent (and can prove it), if he was never married to the mother of the child, they are not considered the child’s legal parent and do not have any legal rights or responsibilities for the child UNLESS paternity/parentage is legally established according to these presumptions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2379" id="footnote-ref-2379">[2379]</a></sup> To learn more about how paternity/parentage is established, keep reading this section.For same-sex couples, if a couple conceives through assisted reproduction (i.e. with a sperm or egg donor) than the non-biological parent is treated by law as if they were the legal parent of the child as long as there is consent in writing signed by both parents.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2380" id="footnote-ref-2380">[2380]</a></sup></sup> The couple does not need to be married to meet this standard.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2381" id="footnote-ref-2381">[2381]</a></sup></sup> Non-biological parents can also establish parentage if they received the child into their home and openly held them out to be their natural child, or were married at the time the child was born, but to establish legal parentage this way you would need to go to court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2382" id="footnote-ref-2382">[2382]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153663"></a>Why does legal paternity/parentage matter? </h3>
                <p class="text">Establishing paternity/parentage gives you and your child many rights, including a right to child support, access to your child’s medical records, public benefits for you and the child, and more. Once parentage is established, a family-related court (family court, probate court, or dependency court) can make orders for custody, visitation, child support, health insurance, name changes, and reimbursement of pregnancy and birth costs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2383" id="footnote-ref-2383">[2383]</a></sup></sup> Until parentage is established, the court can’t make orders about these issues.</p>

                <p class="text">There are two reasons why paternity/parentage can be important in reentry:</p>
                <ol class="text">Only biological or adoptive parents have legal rights to care to for and making decisions about their child. You may have an informal agreement if you are not the biological parent, but you cannot go to court to ask a judge for (more) custody or visitation. However, if you are not the biological or adoptive parent of the child, you can seek custody or visitation by asking a judge in court to become a guardian or foster parent. For information on how to become a guardian, see PG. 830. For information on how to become a foster parent, see PG. 842. If you are the biological or adoptive parent, you may have child support obligations. For more on child support obligations, see PG. 860. </ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If a person is established as a legal parent of a child, that person MUST financially support the child. It is a crime for a legal parent to fail to support his or her child.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2384" id="footnote-ref-2384">[2384]</a></sup></strong> A legal parent also has the right to get custody or visitation rights related to the child. For more information on how financial support may occur, please see the our section on Child Support section beginning on PG. 860. For more information on custody and visitation, please see the overview on custody and visitation on PG. 805. </p>

                <p class="text">Yes. After establishing paternity, a parent with a criminal record may be limited or completely denied some or all of the benefits of paternity at the time of the court hearing OR may have to establish a record of good behavior to do things like visit the child. This is a sad reality for many people in reentry trying to reconnect with their children. However, to even begin the process and establish a record of good behavior, it’s necessary to establish legal paternity/ parentage.</p>

                <p class="text">There are two main ways to establish paternity/parentage when the child’s parents are not married: </p>
                <ol class="text">Go to court and get a court order—either on your own or with the help of the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA). To begin, you should collect the forms you will need and file them in the county where your child lives (see <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm</a> for help on finding the right county.)

                <p class="text">Yes, you can establish paternity/parentage while you are incarcerated, but it will be difficult.If you establish paternity/parentage through a court order, you are required to file the correct forms and “serve” them – give them formal notice - on the other party in the suit. You also have to make arrangements to either attend court hearings in person or through a videoconference. You can do all these things while you are incarcerated but it may not be easy:<strong><em>Forms:</em></strong> We recommend you obtain assistance from one or all of the following:</p>
                <ol class="text">You can write to the Family Law Facilitator in the county where your child is currently livingLaw clerks in the law library (if you have one in your institution)Family and Friends – they can call the Family Law Facilitator for you or download the correct forms off the internet at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm</a> and send them to you. </ol>
                <p class="text"><strong><em>Filing fees:</em></strong> If you have limited funds, we recommend you try and obtain a file fee waiver from the court. <strong><em>Attending court hearings:</em></strong> you can do one of the following:</p>
                <ol class="text">Request to be transported to court for the hearings. For more information on your right to be transported to court see PG. 818.An alternative to your physically appearing in court is appearing by telephone or videoconference. We recommend that you ask for one of these options if transportation to court is not possible or feasible for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2385" id="footnote-ref-2385">[2385]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">If you establish paternity/parentage by signing a “Declaration of Paternity,” it must be signed by both parents at the same time and notarized. If you are incarcerated, this may not be possible. Another challenge is that the form is in triplicate and is only available through government offices such as county Social Services, Registrars of Births and Deaths, and Family Law Facilitators.<sup><a href="#footnote-2386" id="footnote-ref-2386">[2386]</a></sup> </p>

                <p class="text">You can end a marriage or domestic partnership while you are incarcerated in the same way you would if you were out of prison or jail. However, there are a few factors you should take into consideration when deciding whether or not to end your marriage or domestic partnership while you are incarcerated:</p>
                <ol class="text">You may not be able to go to the court hearings.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2392" id="footnote-ref-2392">[2392]</a></sup></sup> You will not be able to get physical custody of any child(ren).You are not guaranteed visitation rights with any child(ren).It can be difficult to access information about your finances and property while you are incarcerated. </ol>

                <p class="text">Yes you can. The same requirements apply as if you were not incarcerated. See Appendix J, PG. 911, for the steps. But there are some things you should consider:</p>
                <ol class="text">You will not be able to present at the hearing unless it is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2393" id="footnote-ref-2393">[2393]</a></sup></sup> It will be very hard for you to show that it is necessary for you to be present at court. To request to be present, you must file a motion with the court explaining your reasons for wanting to be at the hearing. You can also request that you be allowed to call in or participate by videoconference.You won’t be able to gain custody because you are incarcerated so that part of your divorce proceeding will not be handled. Instead, you will have to come back to court once you are released to discuss custody.There is no guarantee that your child or children will visit you in jail and may be more difficult if you get a divorce while in jail.Since you will not be present at the divorce, you may not be able to get information about property or financial interests that you may be entitled to from your spouse. If you get a divorce while incarcerated, you will not be able to go back to get these things.</ol>

How do I get a divorce?</h3>
                <p class="text">The process of divorce is the same, but you CANNOT make contact with your spouse or domestic partner. Instead, you will have to ask someone to file your forms for you. To protect yourself and to make sure you do not violate the no-contact order, talk to your attorney who represented you at the time you received the protective order if you received the no-contact order as a result of a criminal investigation or criminal conviction. If the no-contact order was <em>condition of your parole</em>, you should contact the defense attorney/public defender who represented you and/or ask your parole officer for help. Both of these people can help you find resources so that you can begin the divorce process. </p>

                <p class="text">If you can no longer find your spouse, you must still file the paperwork and go through the steps of filing a divorce (see Appendix J on PG. 911 for those steps). When you appear in court however, you will need to show that you tried your best to find your spouse. The judge may ask you questions about how you tried to find your spouse. If the judge feels like more should be done, s/he may require you to “notify” your spouse by “publication” (a newspaper posting) or by “posting” (putting the divorce notice on a bulletin board in the courthouse).<sup><a href="#footnote-2394" id="footnote-ref-2394">[2394]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">You will likely receive paperwork through the mail, which will include the Summons, and Petition legal papers that were filed by your former spouse. You will also receive a form called the “Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt” (FL-117). This form asks if you would like to “waive” (meaning give up) your right to be served with future papers. If you do not agree to give up this right, then your spouse seeking the divorce will have to arrange for someone to serve future papers related to the divorce to you personally (usually someone you spouse hires or someone in law enforcement).Once you have received this paperwork, you will have 30 days to respond.<sup><a href="#footnote-2395" id="footnote-ref-2395">[2395]</a></sup> For steps on how to respond, please see Appendix J on PG. 911. Unfortunately, however, there is no law saying you have the right to be present at the court hearing—unless there will be a potential change in your rights as a parent).<sup><a href="#footnote-2396" id="footnote-ref-2396">[2396]</a></sup> BUT you can still respond! You should still respond to the petition within 30 days if you disagree with something that is included in the paperwork filed by your spouse—for example, see Appendix J on PG. 911, for reasons why you could disagree with the petition. </p>

                <p class="text">Many people coming home from prison or jail are surprised to find they owe lots of money to various courts, agencies, and people. The money you owe can make it very hard to get back on your feet, which can leave you feeling frustrated and discouraged. In this section, we will walk you through the different types of court ordered debts that a judge can order you to pay to support your children or spouse. </p>

                <p class="text">In the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717, we explain the types of court-ordered debts you may owe because of criminal justice system involvement. Examples of these debts include: <em>restitution; court fines and penalties; administrative fees; and traffic fines and fees</em>.There are a <em>other court-ordered debts</em> we do not cover in that chapter because these debts are specific to court orders involving your child(ren) or former spouse.

                <p class="text">Family-related court-ordered debts are important to manage and navigate because if you are <em>unaware, unwilling, or unable to pay</em>, they can add up quickly and harm you as you try to rebuild stability in your reentry. If you owe money to help support your child or spouse, this may affect your wage earnings, credit score, ability to secure housing, bank accounts, and failure to pay could be a violation of your conditions of parole, probation, or other type of community supervision. Here, we describe each family-related court-ordered debt, how to find out if and how much you owe, how to request a change to the order, how to manage your payments, and the consequences for failure to pay.</p>

                <p class="text">Child support is a <em>monthly payment</em> that a judge can order a PARENT (including an adoptive parent) to make to another parent or caregiver to cover the child’s care and living expenses. State law says that every parent must financially support his or her child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2397" id="footnote-ref-2397">[2397]</a></sup> Usually, the parent who does <em>not</em> have custody of the child (or who has custody some of the time and earns more money) pays child support to the parent or caregiver who has custody of the child most or all of the time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2398" id="footnote-ref-2398">[2398]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">A court can only order you to pay child support if you are legally considered to be the child’s mother or father.<sup><a href="#footnote-2399" id="footnote-ref-2399">[2399]</a></sup> You have to pay child support when a family court judge makes a <em>child support order</em>, which says how much each parent is required to pay. A family court judge can make a child support order in any of the following cases (<em>please note:</em> <em>EITHER</em> parent can ask the judge for a child support order in any of the following cases):<sup><a href="#footnote-2400" id="footnote-ref-2400">[2400]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">In general, you must continue to make child support payments until your child turns 18 years old,<sup><a href="#footnote-2402" id="footnote-ref-2402">[2402]</a></sup> or until the judge or LCSA agrees to change the order. Child support also ends if your parental rights are terminated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2403" id="footnote-ref-2403">[2403]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question">Do legal guardians have to pay child support?</h5>
                <p class="text">No.<sup><a href="#footnote-2404" id="footnote-ref-2404">[2404]</a></sup> Child support is a parental responsibility, not a legal guardian’s responsibility, and therefore a judge cannot order a legal guardian to pay child support.<sup><a href="#footnote-2405" id="footnote-ref-2405">[2405]</a></sup> But <em>adoptive parents</em> DO take on a legal financial responsibility to support their adoptive child(ren)—because they assume <em>all legal rights and responsibilities of biological parents</em> (unlike legal guardians).<sup><a href="#footnote-2406" id="footnote-ref-2406">[2406]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">In general, your child support payments go to the child’s other parent or caregiver who has physical custody of the child, OR to the state of California if your child receives public benefits or if Child Protective Services (CPS) is involved. </p>
                <h5 class="question">Can you pay child support directly to the legal guardian of a child?</h5>
                <p class="text">You can pay child support directly to the guardian in an informal capacity. If the guardian or the local child support agency (LCSA) has requested child support in court you will have to pay the state disbursement unit and they will provide support to your child’s guardian.<sup><a href="#footnote-2407" id="footnote-ref-2407">[2407]</a></sup> </p>

                <p class="text">Owing child support can affect every area of your reentry from getting employment to occupational licenses to public benefits and even housing. If you do not make child support payments, you can face such serious consequences as the following:</p>
                <ol class="text">If you are employed, your employer will automatically deduct (take away) a portion of your wages to pay your current and/or overdue child support obligations (called a <em>wage assignment</em> or <em>wage garnishment</em>);<sup><a href="#footnote-2408" id="footnote-ref-2408">[2408]</a></sup>Your child support payments can be automatically deducted (taken away) from other income and benefits you earn, including state or federal income tax refunds, workers’ compensation benefits, unemployment and state disability benefits, retirement benefits, and lottery winnings;<sup><a href="#footnote-2409" id="footnote-ref-2409">[2409]</a></sup>Liens can be placed on your property and bank accounts to pay overdue child support (see PG. 794 for more information about liens;<sup><a href="#footnote-2410" id="footnote-ref-2410">[2410]</a></sup>Your driver’s license, occupational license, and commercial or recreational licenses may be suspended, revoked, or denied;<sup><a href="#footnote-2411" id="footnote-ref-2411">[2411]</a></sup>Your passport may be revoked or denied;<sup><a href="#footnote-2412" id="footnote-ref-2412">[2412]</a></sup>Unpaid child support will be reported to credit bureaus, which can hurt your credit rating and make it harder to get a loan, rent an apartment, or find a job;<sup><a href="#footnote-2413" id="footnote-ref-2413">[2413]</a> </sup>AND/ORThe amount of interest that you owe will continue to increase.<sup><a href="#footnote-2414" id="footnote-ref-2414">[2414]</a></sup><em>If you are unemployed and do not pay your child support obligations</em>, the judge may order you to get a job (or at least to try). For example, the judge may order you to apply for a certain number of jobs every week until you get hired, and may require you to bring in proof of every job application you do.<sup><a href="#footnote-2415" id="footnote-ref-2415">[2415]</a></sup>Finally, if the judge finds that you are <em>able</em> to make child support payments and are <em>willfully</em> failing to pay, the judge can find you “in contempt of court” and have you arrested or put in jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-2416" id="footnote-ref-2416">[2416]</a></sup> However, the judge usually only does this as a last resort, if all other enforcement efforts have failed.</ol>

                <p class="text">If you were ordered to pay child support, you should have received papers from the LCSA or the other parent.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2417" id="footnote-ref-2417">[2417]</a></sup></sup> If you can’t remember whether you received papers (or you don’t have them anymore), you should contact the LCSA to find out how much you owe.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2418" id="footnote-ref-2418">[2418]</a></sup></sup> To find the LCSA in your county, call 1-866-901-3212 or visit <a href="http://www.childsup.ca.gov/home/lcsaoffices.aspx">http://www.childsup.ca.gov/home/lcsaoffices.aspx</a>. You can also contact the family court clerk to get a copy of your child support order and other court papers. If you disagree with the amount of overdue child support you (or the other parent) owe, you can ask the LCSA for a review of your account, and/or you can ask the judge to determine how much money you owe (called a Judicial Determination of Arrears).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2419" id="footnote-ref-2419">[2419]</a></sup></sup> If the overdue child support payments are from the period of time you were incarcerated, there is a special form to ask the judge how much you owe (Form FL-676: Request For Judicial Determination of Support Arrearages or Adjustment of Arrearages Due to Incarceration or Involuntary Institutionalization.)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2420" id="footnote-ref-2420">[2420]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you <em>never received any papers or child support order</em>, but the LCSA now says that you owe child support, you may be able to have the judge <em>cancel</em> the child support order.

                <p class="text">You can make payments by one of the following methods, depending on whether or not the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) is involved:</p>
                <ol class="text">If the LCSA is involved (there is a formal arrangement for support payments between you and the other parent or caregiver:When you pay your child support, you are making these payments to the California State Disbursement Unit (SDU).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2427" id="footnote-ref-2427">[2427]</a></sup></sup> Under federal law, the California SDU is required to process 100% of child support payments (which used to be processed by the LCSA itself, but no longer).<sup><a href="#footnote-2428" id="footnote-ref-2428">[2428]</a></sup>Mail your payment (check or money order) to the California SDU at the following address:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2429" id="footnote-ref-2429">[2429]</a></sup></sup>California SDU, P.O.

                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintKeep Records of Your Payments!</h4>
                <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! Whether you are making your payments to the California SDU or directly to the other parent, it’s a good idea to <em>always keep a record of every payment you make</em>. You can keep a separate notebook where you write down the <em>date</em> and <em>amount</em> of each payment, or make notes on a calendar every time you make a payment (including the date and amount).</p>
                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint	I lost my job or went to jail and cannot afford my child support payments!	</h4>
                <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! If you cannot pay or are falling behind on your child support payments because you lost your job, went to jail, or some other important changes have happened, it’s recommended that you<em> immediately</em> contact the LCSA and/or family court and ask to change your child support amount. Don’t wait! You are responsible for paying the full amount of child support until the LSCA or judge changes the child support order. For more information about changing your child support order, see Appendix K, PG. 914.</p>

                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your CURRENT and FUTURE child support payments is different than the process for changing your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt. This question will explain how to change your <em>current</em> child support payments. To learn about changing your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt, see PG. 860.<strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="text">First the bad news: In general, you CANNOT go back and change the amount of past, overdue child support payments and interest that you owe. (The only exception is for child support orders issued on or after July 1, 2011, or if you agree to settle your past debts owed the other parent or the state—see PG. 860 to learn more).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2432" id="footnote-ref-2432">[2432]</a></sup></sup>But you CAN ask the judge to change the amount of child support that you have to pay in the future, starting from the date when you file your court papers. You CAN also ask the judge to set up a monthly payment plan so you can repay what you owe in installments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2433" id="footnote-ref-2433">[2433]</a></sup></sup> To ask for a change in your child support payments while incarcerated, fill out the “Incarcerated Parent’s Request to Review Child Support” form and send it to your local child support agency (LCSA).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2434" id="footnote-ref-2434">[2434]</a></sup></sup> You can ask the prison or jail for a copy of this form, or for a sample form. If the form is not available, you should contact the LCSA immediately by phone or letter, and explain that you are incarcerated and need to change your child support payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2435" id="footnote-ref-2435">[2435]</a></sup></sup> See Appendix A, PG. 881, to find contact information for a list of LCSAs by county in California.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In general, the judge can only change the amount of child support you owe for <em>future</em> payments (starting from the day you file papers asking for the change). The judge cannot reduce the amount of <em>past</em> child support that you owe. Therefore, you should contact the LCSA and/or file your court papers <em>as soon as you are incarcerated</em>, if possible, to request a change in your payments.</p>
                <p class="text"><em>If you are served with new child support papers while in prison or jail</em>, you should contact the LCSA listed on the paperwork right away. It is best to contact the LCSA <em>in writing</em>, by filling out and sending back the blank <em>Response</em> form that you receive with the court papers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2436" id="footnote-ref-2436">[2436]</a></sup> You only have <em>30 days</em> (starting from the day you receive the papers) to respond to the LCSA and/or the court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2437" id="footnote-ref-2437">[2437]</a></sup></sup> You must notify the LCSA again once you are released.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2438" id="footnote-ref-2438">[2438]</a></sup></sup>To change the amount of your current and future child support payments, you must ask the judge or LCSA (if involved in your case) to change your child support order.See the chart on the next page as a guide for how to request a change to current and future child support payments.</p>

                <p class="text">Yes. Failure to pay child support can amount to a violation of supervision or parole if you are held in contempt of court for willfully withholding payment. This is because carrying out any criminal activity (which acting in contempt of court is) is a general violation of parole and supervision (for more information on parole and probation conditions, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, PG. 130).</p>

                <p class="text">Not paying child support can have very serious consequences. If a family court judge finds that you have the ability to pay support but are willfully not paying it, it can find you “in contempt of court.” Being “in contempt of court” means you are not following an order from a judge and it could be punished with jail time. This enforcement tool is generally used only when all others have failed since it has such serious consequences.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2453" id="footnote-ref-2453">[2453]</a></sup></sup> If you are being charged with contempt of court and could face criminal charges, you have the right to a lawyer.

                <p class="text">If you have been “served” spousal support papers (meaning that someone has given you, or mailed you legal papers telling you that they have filed papers that ask the Family Court to issue an order about spousal or partner support), you should respond if you want to have input into the judge’s final decision.To respond, you must file a “<em>Responsive Declaration to Request for Order” </em>(Form FL-320) and your “<em>Income and Expense Declaration” </em>(Form FL-150). Once you have filled out the forms, you could ask your Family Law Facilitator to review them before filing with the court clerk. After you have filed your forms, you must serve your spouse/partner with your response and your Form FL-320 at least 9 days before the hearing (which is scheduled at the time you file your response with the court clerk).</p>

                <p class="text">Your spousal support payments do not automatically stop while you are incarcerated, but you can request that your order be paused or reduced if you are not longer able to pay. For steps on how to change an order, see Appendix L, PG. 921. If you do not ask the family court judge to reduce your spousal support order, then your missed payments plus interest will add up while you are incarcerated, and you must pay this after you are released. To reduce or pause spousal/partner support payments, you should either (1) if no children are involved, contact your local Family Law/Self-Help Facilitator OR (2) if children are involved, contact your local child support agency (LCSA).

                <p class="text">Most spousal support is paid through “earning assignments,” also known as “wage garnishments.” This is a portion of money that is removed from your paycheck BEFORE you get paid. In the same way that many taxes are taken out, an “earning assignment” or wage garnishment is removed directly from your paycheck and is considered payment for your court spousal order (and/or child support order).<sup><a href="#footnote-2460" id="footnote-ref-2460">[2460]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">If you also have a child support earnings assignment in place, child support will be taken from your check first. Then, if you also owe spousal or partner support that will be taken from your check.If the local child support agency (LCSA) is involved in your case, they will automatically issue the earnings assignment and begin collecting from your paycheck through your employer.If the LCSA is not involved in your case, your former spouse or domestic partner, or the court itself, will prepare an “earnings assignment” and send it to your employer.</ol>

                <ol class="text">When the court orders “wage garnishments,” your employer receives court papers that will tell him or her the amount of money that should be taken out (withheld) from your check each pay period. Once your employer receives this paperwork, he or she has just a few days to start taking the money out from your next paycheck.<sup><a href="#footnote-2461" id="footnote-ref-2461">[2461]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Once this money is taken from your paycheck (or “withheld), your employer will send your money based on the type of order was issued. If your order was for:</p>

                <p class="text">After a judge makes a spousal or partner support order, one or both spouses or domestic partners may need to change the order. This may happen because you or your former spouse’s job changed, you or your former spouse does not need support any more, or you would like to make changes because the spouse that is paying cannot afford to pay the ordered amount. When deciding whether to change the order, a judge will look to determine if there is are “changes in circumstances.” </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Unless the judge signs a new court order, the existing spousal or partner support amount and order will not be changed. So, to protect yourself, even if you have a verbal agreement with your spouse/domestic partner to change the spousal or partner support amount, put it in writing and have a judge sign it. That way you have a current spousal or partner support order that reflects the current amount.</p>
                <p class="text">IMMEDIATELY! It takes time for the courts to process paperwork and/or to schedule a hearing before a judge to change court orders and you do not want to get into trouble if your circumstances have changed and now it is difficult to pay. Remember, failure to pay because you do not want to pay may result in the court stating you are in “contempt of court” which may lead to jail time.For steps on how to change your spousal support court order, see Appendix L, PG. 921.</p>

                <p class="text">Someone cannot be put in jail just because they owe money.

                <p class="text">Domestic violence is defined as abuse or threats of abuse between two people who are in or have been in an intimate relationship (married or domestic partners, dating or used to date, live or lived together, or have a child together), or when there is violence between two people closely related by blood or by marriage.Domestic violence laws consider the following to be <em>abuse</em>:</p>
                <ol class="text">Physically hurting or trying to hurt someone, intentionally or recklessly;Sexual assault;Making someone reasonably afraid that they or someone else are about to be seriously hurt (like threats or promises to harm someone); ORBehavior like harassing, stalking, threatening, or hitting someone; disturbing someone’s peace; or destroying someone’s personal property.</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you were abused by your partner before you were incarcerated and/or are afraid of your partner, it may help you to talk to a domestic violence counselor, even if you do not want (or are not sure if you want) to ask for legal protection. </p>

Violations of a protective order can include contacting the person through social media even if it is just tagging a protected person in a picture or a comment. Violation of a protective order may also be leaving messages or being in the physical area of a protected person. A court may determine that you violated a protective order even if you respond to a message sent by the protected person. With all of these things in mind, the most simple instruction is to do not contact or respond to a person who has a restraining order against you in ANY manner.</p>

It is your duty, as the restrained person under the protective order, to make sure that you quickly leave the area and do not try and communicate with your partner when you realized that your partner is in the same area.NOTE: It is possible for both people to have <strong><em>mutual restraining orders</em></strong> against one another. To stay in compliance, you should follow any orders against you, even if you also have an order against the other person.</p>

                <p class="text">This Appendix explains more about the rules and procedures for child custody <em>mediation</em>—which can help to resolve disagreements about the care of a child.</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383778"></a><a id="_Toc304118875"></a><a id="_Toc311903201"></a>What is child custody mediation?</div>
                <p class="text"><em>Child custody mediation</em> is a meeting place through the court for parents and caregivers to handle disagreements about custody and visitation plans for their children.<sup><a href="#footnote-2479" id="footnote-ref-2479">[2479]</a></sup> In mediation, there is another person, a third-party <em>mediator</em>, who helps parents or caregivers come to an agreement. After mediation, the judge must sign this agreement in court to make it official. In some cases, the judge will make changes that he or she believes are in the “best interest of the child.”<sup><a href="#footnote-2480" id="footnote-ref-2480">[2480]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Child custody mediation may not be appropriate in cases of domestic violence. A mediator’s role is to help resolve issues between parents who disagree, not to address issues related to domestic violence. </p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc304118876"></a><a id="_Toc311903202"></a>What happens in child custody mediation?</div>
                <p class="text">The mediator will meet with you and the other parent (or caregiver), either together or separately with your attorneys. The mediator will first ask questions to understand your family history and will share information about what children generally need at different ages.<sup><a href="#footnote-2481" id="footnote-ref-2481">[2481]</a></sup> The child(ren) may be interviewed to better understand the situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2482" id="footnote-ref-2482">[2482]</a></sup>Appointments with your mediator may last only a short time or take several hours. You may also meet with the mediator more than once.If the parents are able to agree, the mediator helps the parents write a custody and visitation plan. <em>If the custody and visitation plan is signed by the judge</em>, this plan becomes an official court order. But it’s not official until signed by the judge.In some counties in California, the mediator will make <em>recommendations</em>, as well, and may provide that written recommendation to the judge.</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383782"></a><a id="_Toc304118877"></a><a id="_Toc311903203"></a>Who is the mediator in child custody mediation? </div>
                <p class="text">A mediator is a person who has been professionally trained (usually has a graduate degree) to help resolve disagreements between two people figuring out parenting plans, and knows a lot about the California family court system.The mediator will not and <em>cannot</em> know you or the other parent/caregiver because he or she is supposed to listen to both of you <em>equally and fairly</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2483" id="footnote-ref-2483">[2483]</a></sup> The mediator helps you decide when the children will be with each parent, how future decisions about your children will be made and will help you consider the best way to protect your children’s safety and well-being.<sup><a href="#footnote-2484" id="footnote-ref-2484">[2484]</a></sup>The mediator may also have additional information about community services that may be helpful to you and your child(ren).</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc304118878"></a><a id="_Toc311903204"></a><a id="_Toc302383783"></a>How do I find a mediator? </div>
                <p class="text">You can find low-cost mediators on the following website: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-familycourtservices.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-familycourtservices.htm</a> (organized by county).</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc304118879"></a><a id="_Toc311903205"></a>I do not speak English and/or English is not my first language. Can I get an interpreter for my child custody mediation appointment?</div>
                <p class="text">It depends on the court. If you need an interpreter, you can ask your mediator if he/she has any recommendations. Also be sure to ask if there will be a fee, and if there is a fee for an interpreter, whether or not it can be <a id="_Toc302383781"></a>waived (removed).</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc304118880"></a><a id="_Toc311903206"></a>Can the child custody mediators make recommendations about who gets custody and visitation? </div>
                <p class="text">It depends on the court. In some local family courts, mediators make recommendations to the judge about child custody and visitation. In these courts, if you and the other parent cannot agree on a parenting plan through mediation, the mediator is asked to give the court a written recommendation. This recommendation will contain the mediator’s opinion about what parenting arrangement will be in your children’s best interest. Both you and the other parent (or caregiver) will also get a copy of the mediator’s recommendation.In other courts, mediation is confidential and the mediators do NOT make a recommendation to the court about child custody and visitation. If the parents agree on any issues, the mediator may provide the court with a written summary that summarizes the issues that the parents agree on.Usually, mediators interview both sides together, but if there has been domestic violence or there is a restraining order between the parents or other concerns about meeting together, the parents may ask to meet with the mediator separately. Sometimes, even when there is no domestic violence, the mediator may decide it is more appropriate and helpful to meet separately with each parent. The special rules about mediation allow the mediator to do this.</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383784"></a><a id="_Toc304118881"></a><a id="_Toc311903207"></a>Is child custody mediation confidential?</div>
                <p class="text">It depends on the court.The things you tell your mediator, either alone and/or with your child’s caregiver, may not be kept secret (confidential). Ask for information <em>in writing</em> as to whether your conversations will be kept secret or shared with others. You can also ask the Family Law Facilitator about confidentiality and mediation.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If a mediator suspects that there is child abuse or has concerns about the physical safety of the child(ren), he or she may need to report the case to the local child protective services (CPS) or the court.</p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302383785"></a><a id="_Toc304118882"></a><a id="_Toc311903208"></a>will we be forced to make an agreement in the child custody mediation appointment? </div>
                <p class="text">No. You will not be forced or required to make an agreement if you participate in child custody mediation. HOWEVER, before you enter into mediation, you should ask your mediator and/or the judge in family court what could happen if you do not reach an agreement with the other parent/caregiver.<strong>If you and the other parent/caregiver reach an agreement on your parenting/caregiving plan:</strong> The mediator will usually prepare a written agreement for both parents to sign. If neither parent has a lawyer, the mediator or the parents will give the agreement to the judge to approve and sign. When the judge signs it, it becomes an official court order. However, if you do have a lawyer, ask your lawyer any questions you have and ask your lawyer to review your written agreement BEFORE you sign it.<strong>If you and the other parent/caregiver do NOT reach an agreement on your parenting/caregiving plan, the following may happen:</strong></p>

                <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="FC_TOC_AppC"></a>Procedures to Begin or Join a Family Court Case about Custody and/or Visitation</div>
                <p class="text">If you are interested in getting custody of or visitation with your child, before reading this Appendix, we first recommend you read the following sections of this Chapter: STEPS FOR RECONNECTING (see PG. 800). ; BASICS ABOUT CUSTODY AND VISTATION (see PG. 805) These sections will help you understand what custody and visitation mean under law, what each looks like in real life, how your criminal record can affect your rights to custody and/or visitation, generally, and initial steps to take if you are interested in reconnecting with a child in reentry. If after reading the recommended sections of this Chapter, you would like to open a case in Family Court, the information below will help you understand how to begin or join a family court case.<strong>Types of Petitions (court forms) for starting a case in Family Court:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Petition for divorce or legal separation (FL-100):</strong> If you were married and now want to be divorced from the other parent who has custody of your child, you will file for divorce in family court. For more information of divorce or legal separation, see PG. 911. <strong>Petition for Dissolution of civil partnership/legal separation (FL-103):</strong> If you were in a domestic partnership (a same-sex relationship registered with the State of California) and now want to legally terminate that partnership from the other parent who has custody of your child, you would file for dissolution of domestic partnership in family court. For more information of divorce or legal separation, see PG. 911. <strong>Petition for custody and support of minor children (FL-260):</strong> If you were unmarried and the parentage of your child has already been officially established, then you can file a petition for custody and support of minor children in family court. <sup><a href="#footnote-2486" id="footnote-ref-2486">[2486]</a></sup> <strong>Petition to establish parental relationship (FL-200):</strong> If you were unmarried and the parentage of your child has not already been established in family court, then you an file a petition to establish parental relationship. If you have any questions about starting a case and/or if you need help with deciding which form to pick and file, and/or what kind of case you should bring to family court, you can and should contact: a lawyer, the Family Law Facilitator who works at your county family court, (See Appendix A, PG. 881, to find your local Family Law Facilitator), and/or a legal aid provider.</ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTSAssistance, Forms, &amp; Fees in Family Court</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">Family court forms for requesting custody and visitation are available on the California Courts’ website at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1192.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1192.htm</a>.If you have general questions or need assistance filling out your court forms, ask the court Family Law Facilitator to help you. If you have questions about your specific case or circumstances, you should talk to a lawyer.Filing the court papers to request custody or visitation can be very expensive ($400-$500). If you cannot afford to pay this, you can request a fee waiver from the court clerk when you file your papers. Once you file the forms by mailing them to the family court or bringing them to the court in person, you must wait and make sure the family court accepts your forms, that the documents were acceptable. Once you receive notice that the family court accepted the forms, you can move to STEP 4. </ul>
                <h4 class="step">File all of the necessary forms with the family court to join or start a new case. Depending on the court, you may have to file your court forms in personOnce you receive notice from the family court that your forms were acceptable, you must serve a copy of the forms you filed as well as a response form on the person you are bringing a court case against in family court, usually here it will be your child’s other parent. When a case in family court is first filed, it must be personally served on the other party or parties. This means that you cannot mail the forms, but have to find someone to hand deliver the forms to whomever you are suing. This is called “service of process.” Any adult over the age of 18 can do this for you. Form more information on service of process in family court, see . Once the family court accepts your forms and you serve the papers on the other party or parties in the case, the judge in family court will order one, two or all three of the following: <strong>Schedule a hearing you must attend and/or Require you and the other parent to attend a mediationAnd/or order a custody evaluation. </strong></h4>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT!: Completing STEP 5 means you are now involved in an active custody and/or visitation case involving your child. Family court cases, like all court cases, require a lot of paperwork, documents, and forms. Navigating all the court forms and processes can be, and often is, very confusing. We are trying to simplify this process for you by not bogging you down with details on each step mentioned above. As a result, we strongly recommend you get help from another person or organization that specializes in understanding the family court process. They can and will help with all the specifics on forms, documents, paperwork and processes. You should talk to a lawyer, the Family Law Facilitator who works at your county family court and/or the Legal Services for Prisoners with Children (LSPC). </p>

                <p class="text">If the dependency court judge ended your reunification services with your child(ren), your ability to request a change to the judge’s orders will depend on how much time has passed since the case was closed. You <em>may</em> be able to file what is called a 388 petition.If the judge ended your reunification services (for example, because you did not meet the requirements of your case plan in time), and placed your child in long-term foster care or with a legal guardian, or closed your child’s case, you may be able to file papers in dependency court (called a <em>388 petition</em>) asking the judge to change the current court order and give you visitation, custody, and/or end a legal guardianship of your child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2491" id="footnote-ref-2491">[2491]</a></sup> BUT if several years have passed since your child’s dependency case was closed, it may be too late to go back to dependency court and ask to change the court order.<sup><a href="#footnote-2492" id="footnote-ref-2492">[2492]</a></sup> Instead, you can file new papers in <em>family court</em> and ask to change the <em>dependency court</em> order. We briefly explain both processes below.POSSIBILITY #1: If your reunification services ended recently (in approximately the past year):You can file a <em>388 petition</em> in the same juvenile dependency court where your child’s case took place. In your <em>388 petition</em>, you will need to explain AND prove to the judge (with documents, actions, and evidence) that:</p>
                <ol class="text">There has been a <em>significant change in circumstances</em> (your life or how you live) or <em>new evidence</em> in your child’s case since the judge made the current court order (see the Helpful Hint box below for more information and examples of significant changes in circumstances); ANDGiving you visitation, custody, or ending the guardianship is in your child’s best interest.<sup><a href="#footnote-2493" id="footnote-ref-2493">[2493]</a></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintSignificant Change in Circumstances</h4>
                <p class="textbox">The “change in circumstances” must generally be <em>major</em> and <em>long-term</em>. The judge wants to see that you are committed to the change and won’t go back to your old situation—for example, that you successfully completed your prison or jail sentence; your parole, probation, or community supervision; and/or resolved whatever issues caused CPS and the court to get involved in the first place. Other examples might include: completing an anger management or domestic violence program and taking steps to fix any previous harm you caused; completing a drug rehabilitation program and staying sober for a year or more; and avoiding criminal activity or arrest for several years<strong> </strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2494" id="footnote-ref-2494">[2494]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="text">POSSIBILITY #2: If it has been several years since your reunification services ended:You must go to family court and file papers asking to change the juvenile dependency court order. To be successful, you will have to show:</p>
                <ol class="text">A <em>significant change in circumstances</em> (how your life is different and improved) since the juvenile dependency court judge made the current court order, AND Giving you custody or visitation would be <em>in your child’s best interest</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2495" id="footnote-ref-2495">[2495]</a></sup> </ol>

If you and your child do not appear, a warrant may issued for your child’s arrest and could further complicate your child’s case. Put your child in juvenile hall (this is called “detention”). Your child can make at least 2 phone calls within 1 hour of being arrested. One call must be to a parent, guardian, relative, or boss.

This includes both felonies and misdemeanors. If the court finds the allegations to be true the child will become a “delinquent”.<sup><a href="#footnote-2509" id="footnote-ref-2509">[2509]</a></sup>During what is known as the fitness or waiver hearing, the court will determined whether the child is “unfit” for juvenile court.

If you can prove that your child listens to you and follows your rules, the judge may let your child go home with you. Your child will get a lawyer who speaks for his/her interests, and the district attorney will speak for the state. You can ask to talk to the judge, but the court probably won’t appoint you a lawyer. If your child speaks a language other than English, he/she has a right to an interpreter. You may be able to have one, too. If you need one, ask the court before the hearing date. The court will consider how old your child is, how serious the crime is, and whether your child already has a criminal record. The court will then decide what should happen with your child. <sup><a href="#footnote-2513" id="footnote-ref-2513">[2513]</a></sup></p>

                <ol class="text">Detention hearing: If your child is locked up for more than 2 days, he or she will have a detention hearing within 3 court days. (A court day is a day the court is open.) The judge will decide if your child can go home before the next hearing.The pretrial or settlement conference: In many counties, there is a court date to try to solve the problem without a trial.Hearings on motions: These are court dates to work out different things. Motion hearings can come up at any time during the case.Fitness or waiver hearing: This is a hearing to decide if your child will be tried as an adult. If the judge decides that your child is “unfit” for juvenile court, he or she will be tried in adult court. This will not happen if your child is under 14 years old when he or she committed the crime.Jurisdiction hearing: This is when the judge decides if your child committed the crime.Disposition hearing: If the judge decides your child committed the crime, there will be a disposition hearing to decide how to punish your child. This can be on the same day as the jurisdiction hearing. If the judge says your child did not commit the crime, there will be no disposition hearing.Review hearings: Sometimes there are hearings to see how your child is doing in his placement.<sup><a href="#footnote-2514" id="footnote-ref-2514">[2514]</a></sup></ol>

                <p class="text">Some children can legally be treated as adults in the criminal justice system. If a child is 14 or older, <em>his/her case can be sent to adult court</em> for certain “serious” crimes, such as: Murder or attempted murder; Setting fire to a building with people in it; Robbery with a weapon; Rape; Kidnapping; Carjacking; Crimes with guns; Drug crimes; AND Escape from a juvenile detention facility.If a child is tried in adult court, <em>he/she can be sentenced to adult prison </em>(CDCR).<sup><a href="#footnote-2518" id="footnote-ref-2518">[2518]</a></sup> Depending on how old the child is when sentenced as an adult, and how long the sentence is, he/she may be allowed to stay at DJJ for certain parts of the prison sentence:</p>
                <ol class="text">If the child is <em>under 16</em> <em>when sentenced</em> to adult prison, he/she will stay at the DJJ until he/she is at least 16. If the child is <em>at least 16 when sentenced</em> to adult prison, the judge can send him/her directly to adult prison. Or, if the child’s sentence ends before he/she turns 21, the judge can let him/her stay at the DJJ the whole time. If the child’s sentence ends after he/she turns 21, he/she will go to adult prison when he/she turns 18. </ol>

                <p class="text">Maybe. Your child might be able to get some of his/her juvenile records “sealed”: After your child turns 18, he/she can file a petition to have the records sealed. Or, 5-6 years after the case ends, you can file a petition to do this. If the court approves the petition, all records of the case and the arrest will be sealed.<sup><a href="#footnote-2520" id="footnote-ref-2520">[2520]</a></sup>For more information on sealing juvenile records, speak to your family law facilitator, a lawyer, or contact the clerk at the juvenile delinquency court where you child’s case is being heard.

                <p class="text">The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is focused on identifying and navigating barriers for people in reentry from prison or jail—<em>not</em> on issues faced during your incarceration. But because mothering and pregnancy while incarcerated are such important topics, and can later impact your rights as a parent in reentry, this chapter and appendix provide a brief overview of some key questions you may have if you give birth while you are incarcerated. If you need more information, we recommend checking out the free resources referenced at the end of this Appendix.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading3"><a id="_Toc304119144"></a>Being a New Mother While Incarcerated</h3>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302384052"></a><a id="_Toc304119146"></a>Is there any way I can stay with my child after I give birth?</div>
                <p class="text">Yes, but that chance is very slim. California has six very small mother-infant prison facilities. There are three facilities known as “Family Foundations” and you can only go there if you are sent by your sentencing judge.<sup><a href="#footnote-2521" id="footnote-ref-2521">[2521]</a></sup>The other program is the Community Prison Mother Program. There are also three of these facilities are located in Oakland (Project Pride), Pomona (Prototypes), and Bakersfield (Turning Point).<sup><a href="#footnote-2522" id="footnote-ref-2522">[2522]</a></sup> Women are transferred here after they have given birth, applied to the program, and were accepted. </p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302384053"></a><a id="_Toc304119147"></a>My sentencing judge recommended the Family Foundations program. What is it? What will happen? </div>
                <p class="text">The Family Foundations Program (FFP) is an alternative sentencing program. To begin the process, it is best if your attorney or the court contact the Women and Children’s Services unit so that you may be prescreened for the program to determine if you are eligible and so you can be placed on the waiting list. At sentencing, the judge must recommend you for the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2523" id="footnote-ref-2523">[2523]</a></sup> If you meet the criteria for the program, you will go directly to the FFP location. If you aren’t screened until after you are sentenced, you will go first to prison and then later be transported to a FFP location.<sup><a href="#footnote-2524" id="footnote-ref-2524">[2524]</a></sup> If you have another child and or you give labor prior to going to FFP, your child must be brought to FFP in order for you to stay. If your child isn’t brought to FFP, you will be sent back to state prison. While enrolled in the FFP, you will receive prenatal care, parenting classes and access to prenatal vitamins.<sup><a href="#footnote-2525" id="footnote-ref-2525">[2525]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">By statute, you cannot go to FFP if you Have a prior prison term for, or a current conviction of, any of the so-called “serious” offenses listed in Penal Code section 1174.4(a)(2)If a woman’s child is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile dependency court, and Child protective Services objects<sup><a href="#footnote-2527" id="footnote-ref-2527">[2527]</a></sup>Other CDCR publications include more requirements. For example, a mother must not have an immigration or “potential or active Felony hold”, “must have primary custody of her child or children,” and sets a two-child limit.<sup><a href="#footnote-2528" id="footnote-ref-2528">[2528]</a></sup></p>
                <div class="questionheading">How do I get into the Community Prison Mother Program? </div>
                <p class="text">After you give birth, you will receive notice of and a written application for the Community Prison Mother Program (CPMP).<sup><a href="#footnote-2529" id="footnote-ref-2529">[2529]</a></sup> If you arrive at state prison and you are already a mother, you should be informed of the CPMP.<sup><a href="#footnote-2530" id="footnote-ref-2530">[2530]</a></sup> If you meet the requirements, your facility will declare you “eligible” to participate.<sup><a href="#footnote-2531" id="footnote-ref-2531">[2531]</a></sup> To take part in the program, you must apply and this process can take anywhere from a few months to over a year. But applying DOES NOT mean that you will be accepted. If you are denied, you will receive notice that you were denied and instructions to appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-2532" id="footnote-ref-2532">[2532]</a></sup></p>
                <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc302384056"></a><a id="_Toc304119150"></a>Who is eligible for CPMP?</div>
                <p class="text">To be eligible for the Community Prison Mothering Program, a woman must have one or more biological children under age six when received by or committed to state prison; be the primary caretaker of the children before incarceration, ANDnot been found to be an unfit parent. Or she can be pregnant or have given birth while under CDCR jurisdiction. She must be sentenced to a maximum of six years (after deduction of goodtime credit).</p>

                <p class="text">There are several things that can stop you from being eligible for CPMP.<sup><a href="#footnote-2533" id="footnote-ref-2533">[2533]</a></sup> For example, if you were convicted or pled guilty to certain sex or drug offenses you will not be eligible for CPMP.<sup><a href="#footnote-2534" id="footnote-ref-2534">[2534]</a></sup> You may also be excluded if you have an older child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2535" id="footnote-ref-2535">[2535]</a></sup> </p>
                <div class="questionheading">How do I know if the CPMP is best for me? </div>
                <p class="text">Deciding what is best for you and your unborn child is difficult challenge. The best way to decide if the CPMP is best or finding a guardian can only be done with research and asking questions. </p>

To begin, call the LCSA and ask for an appointment to open a case for parentage and support. You can open a case during the pregnancy and a genetic test can be ordered (if the other person denies being the parent) after the child is born. Also, when one parent is on welfare for the children (for example, if they receive Cal-Works or Medi-Cal), the LCSA automatically gets involved and opens a case.<sup><a href="#footnote-2540" id="footnote-ref-2540">[2540]</a></sup>You may also want to contact your local department of child support services, registrar of births, family law facilitator or welfare office. </p>

If you need more advice or privacy, it would be best to contact a lawyer and/or your local legal aid office. <strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2541" id="footnote-ref-2541">[2541]</a></sup></strong></p>

                <p class="text">Basic steps to file for a divorce or legal separation:</p>
                <ol class="text">Fill our your court forms (see the next section): To file for divorce or legal separation, you have to fill out the same forms. If you want specific legal advice about how to fill out your court forms, talk to a lawyer. What you write on your court papers can be very important and can affect the outcome of the case. It is very important to be accurate and complete, and a lawyer can help you figure out how to fill out the forms so that they accurately reflect your position. This is especially important if you think you and your spouse or domestic partner are likely to have disagreements about the issues that the court forms ask you about.File your forms: Turn in your forms (the originals AND copies) to the court clerk. If there are no obvious errors, the clerk will take the original of each form and return the copies to you, stamped “Filed.”</ol>
                <p class="text">You will have to pay a filing fee. If you cannot afford the fee, you can <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-feewaiver.htm">ask for a fee waiver</a>. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want the judge to make temporary orders for child or spousal support, bill payment, protection from domestic violence, or other issues, you must fill out and file other forms with the order form for a divorce or dissolution of marriage. Talk to your family law facilitator or self-help center to ask for help with temporary orders.</p>
                <ol class="text">Serve your court papers: The law says your spouse or domestic partner must be told that you have started the legal process for a divorce, legal separation, or annulment. To do this, you must “serve” your spouse or domestic partner with copies of all your court papers. The judge CANNOT make any orders or judgments in your divorce or legal separation case until your spouse or domestic partner has been properly “served.”Fill out and serve your financial disclosure forms: You have filed your petition in your divorce or legal separation case. Now, you are ready to complete the financial disclosures needed to get divorced or legally separated. Keep in mind that you can provide your financial disclosures at the same time as your petition if you wish, but NO LATER than 60 days after filing your petition.The next steps all depend on whether or not your spouse or domestic partner has responded to your service. Please see the Judicial Council of California’s website here: for more information on what to do next, or speak to your court’s family law facilitator or an attorney.</ol>
                <p class="text">Basic Steps to Responding to a Divorce or Legal Separation: </p>
                <ol class="text">Either spouse in a marriage or partner in a registered domestic partnership can ask the court to end their legal relationship.If you have been served with a petition and summons for dissolution (divorce) or legal separation, your spouse or domestic partner is asking the court to end your relationship. In California, as long as 1 person wants to end the marriage or domestic partnership, the court can end it, even if the other spouse or domestic partner does not agree or want to get divorced or legally separated.You can either respond by contesting the divorce or dissolution or you can respond by not contesting it, meaning you agree and have no changes to make to the request. </ol>
                <h3 class="subheading3">The Forms</h3>
                <p class="text">There are a lot of California forms that must be completed if you are filing, responding, or completing a divorce or legal separation. You may also have special forms that must be completed depending on the county you live in. To find your county, please see Appendix A on PG. X to find your county. It is VERY important that all of you forms are completed and filed at the right time. To make sure you follow and complete all the steps, you can talk to a lawyer or a family law facilitator to help. Below is a list of forms that you will have to complete whether you are filing or responding to a divorce. </p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Petition</span> — <span class="emphasisitalic">Marriage/Domestic Partnership</span> (Form FL-100). On this form, you give the court some basic information about your marriage and/or domestic partnership, and you ask for the orders you want the court to make.<span class="emphasisitalic">Summons (Family Law)</span> (Form FL-110). This form contains important information for you and for your spouse or domestic partner about the divorce or separation process. It contains some standard restraining orders limiting what you can do with your property, money, and other assets or debts. It also prohibits you or your spouse or domestic partner from moving out of state with your children from your marriage or partnership, and from applying for a new or replacement passport for any of your children together, without the prior written consent of the other or a court order. And it lets you know that if you or someone in your household need affordable health insurance, you can apply for Covered California. READ this form carefully!!</ol>
                <h3 class="subheading3">Declaration Paperwork</h3>
                <p class="text">There may be things you must “declare” meaning you are to tell your spouse and/or the court what you have in order to get a divorce. Below are various forms you may also need to complete.</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Property Declaration (Family Law)</span> (Form FL-160). Use this form if you need more space to list your property and debts. <span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)</span> (Form FL-105/GC-120). Use this form if you have child under the age 18 with your spouse or domestic partner. <span class="emphasisitalic">Child Custody and Visitation Application Attachment</span> (Form FL-311). Use this form if you want to ask the court to make orders about custody and visitation at the time of your divorce. It is an optional form (you do not have to use it).</ol>
                <h3 class="subheading3">Service Paperwork</h3>
                <p class="text">An important part of filing for divorce is “service” which is also considered notification or how the other spouse and, or the local child support agency is told that you want a divorce. Below are forms that you may need:</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt (Family Law)</span> (Form FL-117). Use this form if you decide to do service by mail. This form shows the court that your spouse or domestic partner received your forms. If your spouse or domestic partner does not sign, date, and return this form, you will have to have him or her served again by personal service. Remember, you must have someone 18 years or older (NOT you) and not involved in the divorce (NOT a family, friend, or relative) do this for you. <span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service by Mail to the Local Child Support Agency</span><strong> (Form FL-335).</strong> This form is used when you must serve the LSCA because either you or your spouse receives money or help from the government for a child in your relationship or if you have a current custody case taking place with the LSCA. <span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service of Summons</span> (Form FL-115). This form must be completed whether you decide to have someone hand deliver divorce papers or mail them for you. It is very important your server fills out the Proof of Service correctly. If possible, have your family law facilitator or self-help center review it to make sure it was filled out properly.</ol>
                <h3 class="subheading3">Financial Disclosure Forms</h3>
                <p class="text">In California, you and your spouse must give each other written information on what property or money you have and what expenses you have. This must be done so the property between two people can be split up equally. It also gives you financial information in order to make decisions about child support. If financial disclosures are not exchanged or if the financial disclosures are not correct, the divorce can be cancelled and the court can make orders about the propertyThere are two times when a disclosure occurs: (1) At the time of filing (preliminary disclosure), and (2) at the end of the divorce (final disclosure).Below is a list of official court forms and other things you may need. </p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration of Disclosure. </span>(Form FL-140). This is the form that you will use to write down your expenses. It must be sent to your spouse within 60 days of filing for divorce. This form will not be filed with the court, only given to your spouse. <span class="emphasisitalic">Schedule of Assets and Debts</span> (Form FL-142) or a <span class="emphasisitalic">Property Declaration</span> (Form FL-160); This form will not be filed with the court, only given to your spouse. <span class="emphasisitalic">Income and Expense Declaration</span> (Form FL-150).

This form tells the court that you have given your spouse or domestic partner the preliminary or final declaration of disclosure. This form will be filed with the court. </ol>
