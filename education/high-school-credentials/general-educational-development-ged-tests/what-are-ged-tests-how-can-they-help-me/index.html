    What are GED tests? How can they help me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A General Educational Development (GED) test is a high school proficiency test for adults who never completed high school and want to earn a high school equivalency (GED) certificate.[2678] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    These tests are administered nationally, but three have been specifically approved by the California Department of Education: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    GED® (GED Testing Service); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    HiSET® (ETS); AND 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TASC™ (CTB-McGraw-Hill).[2679] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you pass a GED test in California, you’ll receive a California High School Equivalency Certificate (CAHSEC) (this is the official name for a GED in California).[2680] This certificate is your official proof that you have high school level academic skills. Once you have this certificate, you can apply to colleges and jobs that require a high school credential.[2681] You will need to take and pass the test for several different subject matters (sometimes called “modules”) in order to get your CAHSEC.
