  Brief Introduction to Parts II & III of this Chapter: State Community Supervision

<p>
  Each state in the United States runs its own criminal justice system. In the next two sections of the PAROLE & PROBATION CHAPTER, you will learn about the types of correctional supervision in the community that are run by the state of California:

  Section II covers STATE PAROLE, which is overseen by the California Department of Corrections (CDCR) and the Division for Adult Parole Operations (DAPO).Section III covers COUNTY PROBATION & NEW FORMS OF COUNTY-LEVEL SUPERVISION, which are overseen locally by county probation offices and officers that report back to the state of California.
