  <p>
    What are some steps I can take if I am worried about becoming homeless?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An important step to avoid becoming homeless is to begin planning and identifying housing options while you’re still incarcerated (see question above addressing this topic, PG. 378). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are also agencies and nonprofits in the community working to help people find permanent housing and avoid/get out of homelessness. Here are some organizations that may be able to help:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Public Housing Authority (PHA) in your area: PHAs sometimes give preference to admitting homeless individuals into the Public Housing program or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers. Visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website to find public housing authorities in your area: http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Emergency shelters and assistance: HUD maintains a list of organizations throughout the country that provide emergency shelter and assistance to homeless individuals (visit the following website: http://nhl.gov/homeless/hmlsagen.cfm) .
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans has an online list of organizations throughout the country that will assist homeless veterans on a variety of issues including housing (visit the following website: http://www.nchv.org/network.cfm).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The National Coalition for the Homeless has links to databases related to for local service organizations, educating homeless children, transitional housing, drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers, and day shelters (visit the following website: http://www.nationalhomeless.org/resources/index.html).
