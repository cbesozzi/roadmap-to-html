        <h1>How can a CTE program help me?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352862061"></a>How can a CTE program help me?</h3>
        <p class="text">In California, CTE programs are offered at community colleges, technical colleges, trade schools, vocational schools, at some 4-year colleges—and in many CDCR facilities and county jails. A CTE certification program can be a good path for you if the occupation you want <em>requires</em> a certificate, or if you want to gain practical skills and get into the workforce more quickly. Most CTE certificate programs are designed to get you certified, licensed, and hired in your chosen field directly and efficiently. A certificate can also be a stepping-stone toward a college degree, as some colleges accept certificate program credits and count them as progress toward a college degree.<sup><a href="#footnote-2806" id="footnote-ref-2806">[2805]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: A certificate is NOT a degree. It’s an award that shows you completed an educational or training program after high school. A certificate is also NOT an occupational license or certification, which you may need to do your job, depending on what your field is and where you live.</p>
        <p class="text">The cost of earning a certificate through a CTE program may not be worth it in certain fields where jobs are low-wage, unstable, and difficult to get. Also, if employers in your desired field don’t always require a certificate, you might consider going straight into the workforce. If employers in your field like to see qualifications other than a certificate, such as hands-on experience or some kind of degree, you might want to pursue those qualifications instead.<sup><a href="#footnote-2807" id="footnote-ref-2807">[2806]</a></sup> For more information on researching the job market in your career field, see EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 823.</p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Usually, community or technical colleges require that you have a high school credential before you begin a CTE program. However, even if you don’t have one, you still may be able to enroll. Most community and technical colleges will have classes and support to help you earn your high school credential as well as your CTE certificate. If the CTE program you are interested in is offered at a four-year college or university, you will need to have a high school credential to apply.</p>
        <div class="questionheading">How much time will it take to earn a CTE certificate?</div>
        <p class="text">Many certificate programs can take less than a year to complete, and most are designed to take less than 2 years. However, your total time in a program will depend on the specific program and school you choose and whether you enroll part-time or full time.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintCERTIFICATES, LICENSES, AND CERTIFICATIONS</h4>
        <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">A certificate</span> is not the same as an occupational license or a professional certification. A certificate shows that you have completed a course of study and training in a particular field. Certificates are awarded by CTE programs and many certificate programs can take less than a year to complete, and most are designed to take less than 2 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-2808" id="footnote-ref-2808">[2807]</a></sup> However, your total time in a program will depend on the specific program and school you choose, and whether you enroll part-time or full time in school. After earning a certificate, you may also need to get a license from the state or a certification from the professional organization that regulates your job field. <span class="emphasisitalic">A license</span> shows that you have the government’s permission to practice your occupation. State and local boards and agencies issue licenses. <span class="emphasisitalic">A certification</span> means that you have demonstrated that you’re skilled enough to practice your occupation, usually by passing evaluations and/or documenting a certain amount of work experience. Professional or industry organizations issue certifications.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2809" id="footnote-ref-2809">[2808]</a></sup></sup></p>
