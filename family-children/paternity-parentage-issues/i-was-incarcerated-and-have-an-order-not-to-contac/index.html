  <p class="text">The process of divorce is the same, but you CANNOT make contact with your spouse or domestic partner. Instead, you will have to ask someone to file your forms for you. </p>
  
  <p class="text">To protect yourself and to make sure you do not violate the no-contact order, talk to your attorney who represented you at the time you received the protective order if you received the no-contact order as a result of a criminal investigation or criminal conviction. If the no-contact order was <em>condition of your parole</em>, you should contact the defense attorney/public defender who represented you and/or ask your parole officer for help. Both of these people can help you find resources so that you can begin the divorce process. </p>

How do I get a divorce? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">If you can no longer find your spouse, you must still file the paperwork and go through the steps of filing a divorce (see Appendix J on PG. 1011 for those steps). When you appear in court however, you will need to show that you tried your best to find your spouse. The judge may ask you questions about how you tried to find your spouse. If the judge feels like more should be done, s/he may require you to “notify” your spouse by “publication” (a newspaper posting) or by “posting” (putting the divorce notice on a bulletin board in the courthouse).<sup><a href="#footnote-2464" id="footnote-ref-2464">[2432]</a></sup></p>
