        <h1>Scenario 2: Becoming a Foster Care Parent or Guardian of Someone Else’s Child through Juvenile Dependency Court</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="FC_IX_Dependency_FosterCare"></a><a id="_Toc317247536"></a><a id="_Toc448153635"></a><em>Scenario 2:</em> Becoming a Foster Care Parent or Guardian of Someone Else’s Child through Juvenile Dependency Court</h2>
        <p class="text">The second scenario we deal with in this section is answering questions for people with records who want to BECOME the foster care parent or guardian of a child who has an open CPS and dependency court case. The dependency court has its OWN RULES—different from probate court and family court—about the impact a criminal record will have on someone’s request to become the legal caregiver of some else’s child.</p>
