  <h1>What will happen if I can’t pay the restitution?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153539"></a>What will happen if I can’t pay the restitution?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">It depends who you owe the restitution to.</p>
  
  <p class="text"><a id="COD_Pay_FranchiseTaxBoard_incharge"></a>If the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) is in charge of collecting your restitution debt, here are some steps you can take to possibly make your financial situation easier:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">Set Up a Payment Plan: Contact the FTB to discuss your options for paying your debt in installments instead of all at once;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Manage Your Payments Online: Set up an online account to instantly view your current balance, make payments, and keep records of the debt you have already paid.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Get Your Payments Reduced: If the FTB is taking too much money out of your paycheck (called “wage garnishment”) and you don’t have enough to live on, you can claim financial hardship and ask the FTB to reduce the amount being taken out of each paycheck. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2195" id="footnote-ref-2195">[2163]</a></sup></sup> (Note: The FTB can only lower the amount taken from each payment, but cannot reduce the total amount of debt that you owe.) (See PG. 824 for more information on wage garnishment.) </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Dispute the Amount You Owe: If you disagree with the AMOUNT of debt you owe, you will need to contact the local court or county collection agency listed on your demand notice (the document notifying you that you owe money) directly. The FTB can help you lower the amount you pay each month, but it CANNOT answer questions or make changes to your total debt orders.</ol>
  
  <p class="textbox"><em>The California FTB employs representatives to help you. </em>You can call the FTB at (916) 845-4064 during normal weekday hours (Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.) or visit the FTB’s website at: <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/index.asp">https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/index.asp</a>.<strong>Can my public benefit payments be garnished to pay off restitution?</strong>Yes. At least when it comes to Social Security, the court is authorized to order garnishment of public benefits as a means of paying off victim restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2196" id="footnote-ref-2196">[2164]</a></sup> The government agency that provides the public benefit can garnish a maximum of 25 percent of your monthly benefit amount.<sup><a href="#footnote-2197" id="footnote-ref-2197">[2165]</a></sup> <strong>The victim NEVER CLAIMED RESTITUTION. DO I STILL HAVE TO PAY?</strong>Yes. The CDCR is in charge of managing restitution accounts for direct orders, even once you are released. Most of the time, the CDCR does not initially have an address for the victim to which they can direct payments. In such a case, depending on your custody status, either the CDCR or the Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board hangs onto the payments until the victim can be located.  State law permits victims to come forward at any time to claim restitution collected on their behalf.<sup><a href="#footnote-2198" id="footnote-ref-2198">[2166]</a></sup> <strong>The victim who was receiving my restitution payments just died. Do I still have to pay?</strong>Yes. If you were ordered to pay restitution directly to the victim of a crime (“direct order”), and that victim has died, the executor or administrator of the victim’s estate will begin receiving restitution payments on his or her behalf.<sup><a href="#footnote-2199" id="footnote-ref-2199">[2167]</a></sup> Of course, restitution can only be awarded for economic losses the victim incurred before he or she died, so any additional economic losses incurred after or as a result of the victim’s death are not your responsibility.<sup><a href="#footnote-2200" id="footnote-ref-2200">[2168]</a></sup></p>
