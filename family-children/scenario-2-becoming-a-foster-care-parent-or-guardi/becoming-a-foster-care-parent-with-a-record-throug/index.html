          <p class="text">Foster care is a system run by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) that provides temporary homes for children who cannot live with family or a legal guardian. A child in foster care was removed from his or her home by Child Protective Services (CPS) because the child’s parents were <em>unable, unwilling or unfit</em> to care for the child. The goal of foster care is to reunify the child with his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) OR find another suitable permanent living arrangement. This may include an adoptive home, long-term guardianship, or living with a relative.</p>
          <ol class="text">For more information on adoption, see PG. 947.</ol>
          <ol class="text">For more information on guardianship, see PG. 927. </ol>

          <p class="text">If you want to become a child’s foster care parent through the dependency court, your criminal record will be a factor both in (1) your ability to get the required <em>state license</em> from the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to be a foster parent AND (2) whether the dependency court judge decides that it is in the<em> “best interest of the child” </em>for you to be their foster parent.<sup><a href="#footnote-2399" id="footnote-ref-2399">[2367]</a></sup></p>

          <ol class="text">For more information on what a dependency court judge looks at when deciding what is in the “best interest of a child,” see PG. 906</ol>
          <p class="text">Before you apply for a foster care license, get a complete record of your convictions. This is important so that you can make sure that your record is correct and so that you can begin, if possible, dismissing convictions from your record if possible.</p>
