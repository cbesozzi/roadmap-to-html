  <p>
    What is a tribal ID card and why would I need it?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tribal identification (ID) cards are issued by tribes as proof of your enrollment and membership in the tribe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A tribal ID card is a valid form of government-issued photo identification in many places (though those places are often unaware of this). For example, a tribal ID card is valid at federal buildings, airports, and banks. It is also proof of eligibility for certain services such as the federal Indian Health Service; it allows you to opt out of Covered California (meaning, you can get an exemption from the tax penalty under “Obamacare”);[239] and it can be used to prove your identification for the California LifeLine cell phone program (read more on PG. 629).[240]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A tribal ID card is not valid proof of identity for every purpose — for example, you cannot use it as ID for notary services in the state of California.[241]
