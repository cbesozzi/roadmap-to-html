  <p>
    How long is my supervision under supervised release?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Supervised Release can be up to 5 years, with a few exceptions discussed below on PG. 250.[808] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The length of the term of your Supervised Release is determined by the “Class” of crime for which you were convicted.[809] To figure out what the range of time your will be sentenced to Supervised Release, you should find out which “Class” of crime you were convicted of (for example, a Class A Felony, Class B Felony, Class A Misdemeanor, etc.). See the chart in the Appendix HH, PG. 364, for more information. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Despite the lengths of Supervised Release listed above, the term length may be up to life if you committed:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An offense listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B), which resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person; ORA sex offense— for these commitment offenses, the maximum term of supervised release as allowed by statute is recommended.
