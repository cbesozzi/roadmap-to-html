  <h1>I’ve heard that if I didn't register with the Selective Service when I was younger, I may not be able to get financial aid for school. Is that true? What can I do?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc328831339"></a>I’ve heard that if I didn't register with the Selective Service when I was younger, I may not be able to get financial aid for school. Is that true? What can I do?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">It’s true. If you failed to register with the Selective Service between the ages of 18 and 25 (<em>before</em> your 26th birthday), you are not eligible for state or federal financial aid — unless you fall into an exception, or you had a really good reason for not registering, such as being incarcerated during the relevant time period. </p>
  
  <p class="text">However, even if you weren’t incarcerated and don’t have a good reason for not registering, you still may be able to get student financial aid, if you can prove that your failure to register was <em>unintentional</em>. In other words, you have to prove that even though you knew you were supposed to register, you weren’t avoiding it on purpose.<sup><a href="#footnote-310" id="footnote-ref-310">[310]</a></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">To prove this, you will have to request a Status Information Letter from the Selective Service System (See Appendix J, on PG. 139), then send that letter to the relevant department at your school, along with a letter explaining why you didn’t register. Generally, an employee of your school will be the one who decides whether you have provided enough proof to qualify for financial aid.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-311" id="footnote-ref-311">[311]</a></sup></sup> Learn more about this topic in the EDUCATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1022.</p>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
  
  <p class="textbox">The school employee in charge of your case is required to consider ALL information related to your situation — not just the Letter from the Selective Serve System says happened — so provide as much detail as possible to make your case stronger. This may include information about where you were living between the ages of 18 and 25, whether you thought you were already registered, and/or why you weren’t aware of the registration requirement.<sup><a href="#footnote-312" id="footnote-ref-312">[312]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <h2><a id="IX_CONCLUSION"></a><a id="_Toc328831340"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>
  
  <p class="text">If you are in reentry, you have quickly realized how important these various forms of identification (“ID”) and other key documents are to rebuilding your life, your identity, and your sense of self.</p>
  
  <p class="text">To review, the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER covered the following topics:</p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Birth certificate</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Social Security Number (SSN) and card</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>California state ID, driver license, and municipal ID</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>U.S. passport</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Library card</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Voter registration</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Selective Service registration</strong></p>
  
  <p class="text">We hope this chapter has empowered you to gather the important documents and ID you need to start over strong — and to understand the different processes and issues that might come up along the way, so you can plan ahead.</p>
  
  <p class="text"><em>Another important set of documents — not covered in this chapter — are copies of your criminal record.</em> It is important to know what could show up from your criminal record as you apply for public benefits, programs, housing, and jobs; how to spot and fix errors; and how to get help with making your record less visible and less powerful by “cleaning” it up. Criminal record issues are so important in reentry that we have dedicated an entire chapter of this guide just to these issues. Go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132, to learn more.</p>
