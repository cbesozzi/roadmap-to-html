  <p>
    I believe my application for General Assistance/General Relief benefits was wrongly denied or stopped. How can I appeal?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are denied or lose General Assistance/General Relief benefits, you can request a hearing at any time. The back of any county notice about General Assistance/General Relief eligibility should contain a form that explains how to request a hearing. You may also request a hearing by calling your county welfare agency. We recommend requesting a hearing in writing, so that there is a record of your compliant. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    General Assistance/General Relief is a county program, so hearings are held by the county, and can only be requested by contacting the county social services agency. Each county has its own specific procedures regarding appeals hearings. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For help filing an appeal, it’s best to find a local legal aid provider. You can search for one by visiting the website http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help, and see the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1286.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can I retroactively apply my Medi-Cal health insurance to a medical bill I got soon after my release BUT before I had signed up for my benefits?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. You can retroctively get reimbursed for eligible medical expenses incurred up to three months before you applied for Medi-Cal.[1344] You must submit a form MC210a (Supplement to Statement of Facts for Retroactive Coverage, available in APPENDIX [] on PG. []), along with any relevant receipts and unpaid bills, within one year of incurring the expenses.[1345] NOTE: you may be eligible for retroactive coverage even if you did not apply or were found ineligible for ongoing coverage.
