  <p>
    How do I register to vote in California? What is the application process?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To register to vote, you need to fill out a voter registration form and submit it to your county elections office (learn how to find your county elections office directly above). You can do this by (1) filling out an online form (if you have access to a computer that’s connected to Internet and a printer) or (2) filling out a paper form.[262] Both methods are completely acceptable, so do what is best and easiest for you! Read on for details. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: If you want to vote in the next election, you must register at least 15 days before that election. Once you’re registered, you can vote in all state and local elections.[263]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Registering through the ONLINE form:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Choose this option only if you have access to a computer that’s connected to the Internet and a printer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Go to the online form.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit http://registertovote.ca.gov/.[264] Click “Register to Vote Now,” and the website will open the form.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Complete the online form. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Click through the pages and enter your information in the boxes. Make sure you answer all questions that are marked by a star (*). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: The form asks for your California driver license or state ID number, birthdate, and the last 4 digits of your SSN. Enter this if you can, but know that you may still be able to vote even if some information is missing. Your county elections official may assign you a special number to vote.[265]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Submit the online form.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What happens next depends on whether you have a valid California driver license or state ID, and whether you have a signature on file with the DMV.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you do have a valid California driver license or state ID: You probably have a signature on file with the DMV. Click “Submit” when you finish the form, and the website will most likely find your signature in the DMV database. It will then send your information to your county elections office. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you don’t have a valid California driver license or state ID: You probably don’t have a signature on file with DMV. Click “Print” when you finish the form, sign the printed form, and submit the printed form to your county elections office — either by mail or in person. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Wait to hear from for your county elections office. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your county elections office will contact you if it approves your voter registration, or if it needs more information to confirm that you can vote.[266] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Registering with the PAPER form:
  </p>

Enter this information if you have it, but know that you may still be able to vote even if some is missing. Your county elections official may assign you a number that will identify you as a voter.[269] When you go to vote on election day, you may have to show documents with your name and address. Examples: a military or student ID, a utility bill, or a check from the government.

     IMPORTANT TIPFilling out the Voter Registration Form
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The voter registration form asks: “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?” By law, you must this question truthfully.[271] Even if you have fully served your sentence and your voting rights have been restored, you must check the “yes” box. If you lie, you could be found guilty of perjury.
