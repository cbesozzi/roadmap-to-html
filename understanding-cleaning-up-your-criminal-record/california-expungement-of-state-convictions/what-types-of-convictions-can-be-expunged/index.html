  <p>
    What types of convictions can be expunged?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under the law, only certain types of convictions can be expunged. Generally, the following types of convictions qualify for expungement: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    the CONVICTION is for:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An Infraction,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A Misdemeanor, or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Felony “wobbler” (with NO prison time); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    the SENTENCE imposed was:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    County jail time,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Probation, 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A fine, or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A combination of these.[2921]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This means that as long as you were sentenced only to pay a fine, serve a term of probation, OR serve time in county jail—even for a felony “wobbler”—your conviction may be eligible for expungement. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IN ADDITION, you must meet the following requirements for your conviction to be eligible for expungement. In general, these requirements are:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You did NOT spend any time in prison for the offense; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are OFF probation or other type of supervision; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are NOT currently charged with, serving a sentence for, or on a term of supervision for another offense.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PLEASE NOTE: Certain convictions are NEVER eligible for expungement (see the next question).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For information more information about the types of California expungement, see PG. 1167.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     IMPORTANT: You must be OFF PROBATION or any other form of supervision to be eligible for expungement![2922] If you are still on probation and want to get your conviction expunged, you must first ask a judge to grant you early release (“early discharge”) from probation BEFORE requesting an expungement. For more information on requesting early release from probation, see PG. 1172.
