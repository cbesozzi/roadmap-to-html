  <p>
    How do I apply for the California LifeLine program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First select a participating telephone company. If you already use a specific phone company, it may already participate in the LifeLine program (you can call the company and ask), or you may select a new telephone company that serves your area by searching online at: https://www.californialifeline.com/en/provider_search.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember, different phone companies provide different service plans, so you might want to shop around!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The telephone company will give you a Lifeline application form, with an Enrollment Code and/or a Personal Identification Number (PIN) in a pink envelope. To view a copy of a sample California LifeLife application form, go to https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_0114.pdf.In order to receive the California LifeLine benefits, you must complete this form, sign it, and send it to the California LifeLine Administrator along with any required documents by the due date listed on the form. You may also apply online at https://www.californialifeline.com/en/login
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, the telephone company will confirm your identity and whether you meet the one phone per household requirement, and then process your application.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have any additional questions about your application, status, or due dates, please call the California LifeLine Administrator's hotline at 1-866-272-0349.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What documents do I need to be found eligible?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, you will need documents that prove who you are (your identity) to the phone company. You may need to show your Social Security card, birth certificate, and/or unexpired driver license. For a complete list of acceptable forms of ID, see www.californialifeline.com, or call 1-877-858-7463. See https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/identity/st_en_10_nc_id_0915.pdf for a “Sample ID Authentication Form”.[1726]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Second, you will need to prove that you require financial assistance. One way to prove this is to show that you receive public benefits from a qualifying state or federal assistance program. You may need to show a copy of your benefits program agreement or benefit card.[1727]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, if you want to prove your eligibility based on your income, you must provide an official document proving your income—for example, an income statement from an employer, a prior year's tax return, a Social Security income statement, a Veterans Administration income statement, and/or a document proving you receive unemployment or some other public benefits. See https://www.californialifeline.com/pdf/new/applications/st_en_10_app_eg_0615.pdf  for a complete list.
