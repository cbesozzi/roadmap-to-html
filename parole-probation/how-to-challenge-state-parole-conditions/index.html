          <h1>How to Challenge State Parole Conditions</h1>
          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="PP_StateParole_ChallengeConditions"></a><a id="_Toc448152827"></a>H<a id="challengeSTATEparoleHRG"></a>ow to Challenge State Parole Conditions</h2>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152828"></a>How can I challenge a parole condition that I believe is unlawful and invalid?</h3>
          <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIt‚Äôs suggested that you sign the Form 1515, and then challenge the condition later. Don‚Äôt refuse to sign!</h4>
          <p class="textbox">First, while you can and should challenge a parole condition that you believe is unlawful, it is usually best for you to sign the CDCR Form 1515: ‚ÄúNotice and Conditions of Parole,‚Äù and to follow all the conditions <em>while</em> you are taking steps to challenge the problematic condition. Otherwise, you may end up having to spend additional time in custody while the matter is being resolved. (For an example Form 1515, see Appendix¬†G, PG.¬†302)</p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">Review: the legal test for finding special parole conditions invalid:</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Courts have held that parole conditions are invalid if they don‚Äôt pass the following 4 tests:TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if it: </p>
          <ul class="sidebox">Has no relation to the commitment offense; Bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and Requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities. </ul>
          <p class="sidebox"><em>You must show that the condition is invalid based on all 3 factors.</em> TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if it infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.<strong> </strong>TEST 3: A parole condition may be invalid if it is excessively broad or so vague that your cannot understand or follow it.TEST 4: A parole condition is invalid if it limits the type of employment you can have, but does not directly relate to your crime.</p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED BY THE BPH:</strong></p>
          <p>To challenge a BPH decision or a parole condition set by the BPH, you do not need to file an administrative appeal ‚Äî UNLESS the issue involves a disability. Since the BPH has no administrative appeal process, you can immediately file a state petition for writ of habeas corpus with the superior court in the county of your parole.</p>
          <p class="text">To learn when and how to file a state petition for writ of habeas corpus, see Appendix¬†K, PG.¬†314, at the end of this chapter.</p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED BY PAROLE: </strong></p>
          <p>To challenge a parole condition imposed by the Department of Adult Parole Operations, you will have to file an administrative appeal, known as a 602 appeal. Keeping in mind the timeline listed on PG. , you can challenge your parole conditions by following these steps:</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STEP 1:</span> Submit two forms <em>at the same time</em>: (1) a CDCR Form 22 to your parole agent, requesting an interview to discuss the issue; and (2) a CDCR Form 602 appeal to the Regional Appeals Coordinator.</p>
          <p class="text">Attach a copy of your Form 22 request to your Form 602 appeal; and, vice versa, attach a copy of your Form 602 to your Form 22 request.<sup><a href="#footnote-526" id="footnote-ref-526">[504]</a></sup> </p>
          <ol class="text">SUBMIT FORM 22: File a CDCR Form 22, ‚ÄúRequest for Interview, Item or Service‚Äù with your parole agent.<sup><a href="#footnote-527" id="footnote-ref-527">[505]</a></sup> You can get this form from any parole field office. <sup><a href="#footnote-528" id="footnote-ref-528">[506]</a></sup> There is an example of Form 22 in Appendix¬†I, PG.¬†309, but always ask for the most current version. Once you have filled out the Form 22, you can deliver it by mail or in person to your parole agent at your parole office. To find your local parole office‚Äôs address, visit the following online directory and click on your region: http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/.</ol>
          <ol class="text">From the time your parole agent receives your Form 22 request, he or she has <em>3 working days</em> to return the original form to you with a response on it, along with a copy. Specifically, your parole agent must: (1) note his or her decision on the form, (2) sign and date the form, and (3) retain a copy for his or her records.<sup><a href="#footnote-529" id="footnote-ref-529">[507]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">SUBMIT FORM 602: At the same time, submit a formal administrative appeal using CDCR Form 602 to your Regional Appeals Coordinator.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-530" id="footnote-ref-530">[508]</a></sup></sup> There is an example Form 602 in Appendix¬†J, PG.¬†311, but always ask your parole agent for the most current version. Along with filling out the Form 602, compile all supporting documents listed on the form. You MUST also include both a copy of your CDCR Form 1515 AND a copy of your Form 22 as supporting documents. Enclose all these documents along with your Form 602, and send it to your Regional Appeals Coordinator. To determine where and to whom you should send your 602 appeal, see Appendix¬†D on PG.¬†296 for a list of Regional Appeals Coordinators.</ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">TIMELINE FOR 602 APPEALS: </h4>
          <p class="sidebox">What timelines must I follow in submitting a 602 appeal?For submitting an initial 602 administrative appeal, you have 30 days to appeal after the event or decision occurs, or after having first knowledge about the action or decision being appealed;If you get an unsatisfactory response from Parole or CDCR to a 602 appeal, you have 30 days to submit a higher-level appeal.SPECIAL NOTE: There are special timelines and processes for submitting (1) emergency appeals, (2) appeals of involuntary psychiatric transfer, and (3) disability-related appeals. What timelines must CDCR/Parole follow in responding to my 602 appeal?CDCR/Parole must respond to your 602 appeals within the following time limits:Parole has 30 working days (from date of receipt by Appeals Coordinator) to complete and return to you a <em>first level response</em> to your 602 appeal. Parole has 30 working days (from date of receipt by Appeals Coordinator) to complete and return to you a <em>second level response</em> to your 602 appeal.Parole has 60 working days (from date of receipt by Appeals Chief) to complete and return to you a <em>third level response</em> to your 602 appealEXCEPTIONS ‚Äî CDCR/Parole is allowed to exceed the above time limits only in certain situations:The parolee, staff, or witnesses are unavailable; The complexity of the decision, action, or policy requires additional research;It‚Äôs necessary to involve other agencies or jurisdictions in the appeal; orA state of emergency requires CDCR/Parole to postpone ‚Äúnonessential administrative decisions and actions, including normal time requirements for such decisions and actions.‚Äù</p>
          <p class="importantbox">WARNING: If you send a Form 602 appeal to the Regional Appeals Coordinator <em>before</em> filing a more informal Form 22 with you parole agent, the Appeals Coordinator may screen out (reject) your 602 for not having first submitted a Form 22. (Parole‚Äôs reasoning is that they want parolees to try and solve these issues informally with their parole agents before a formal appeal is processed.) As long as you file the Form 22 and Form 602 at the same time, your 602 appeal should not be screened out, because the timeline for your parole agent to respond to your Form 22 request is shorter than the timeline for the Appeals Coordinator to respond to your Form 602 appeal.</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STEP 2:</span> You should receive a response to your 602 within 30 working days (don‚Äôt count state holidays or weekends). If CDCR <em>denies </em>your 602 appeal at the first level of review, you must pursue the administrative appeals process through ALL THREE LEVELS OF REVIEW before filing a case in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-531" id="footnote-ref-531">[509]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">There are special rules for processing 602 appeals concerning miscalculated parole discharge dates. First level review is done by the records office staff.<sup><a href="#footnote-532" id="footnote-ref-532">[510]</a></sup> If your appeal is denied at the first level, you can request second level review, which consists of a ‚Äúcomputation review hearing.‚Äù Unless you waive (give up) your rights, you should be notified at least 24 hours before the date and time of the hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-533" id="footnote-ref-533">[511]</a></sup> At the end of the hearing, you should get a copy of the hearing decision on a CDCR Form 1033.<sup><a href="#footnote-534" id="footnote-ref-534">[512]</a></sup> If your appeal is denied at this second level, and/or if you are dissatisfied with the hearing decision, you can submit your appeal to the CDCR Appeals Chief for third level review.</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STEP 3:</span> Finally, if you exhaust (complete) <em>all three levels</em> of the 602 administrative appeals process, you can continue to challenge the calculation of your parole length (or any other parole condition) by filing <em>a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus</em> in the superior court of the county of your parole. To learn how, see the next question, and Appendix¬†K, PG.¬†314!</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">IMPORTANT! WHAT CAN I DO IF CDCR/PAROLE IS VIOLATING THE LEGAL TIME LIMITS FOR RESPONDING TO MY 602 APPEAL?</h4>
          <div class="widetextboxtext">Except for the Third Level of a 602 appeal, CDCR/Parole must provide you <em>in writing</em> with (1) an explanation of the reasons for delay, and (2) an estimated completion date. This information must be given to you within the time limits listed on page [}.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-535" id="footnote-ref-535">[513]</a></sup></sup>Unfortunately, it‚Äôs likely that the CDCR Regional Appeals Coordinator office will not provide a formal written response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law. Be sure to ask your parole agent and parole agent‚Äôs supervisor for the formal response to your 602 appeal at any of the three levels of review. If you have asked for a formal written response, and you do not receive one in person or by mail within a reasonable time, you can:(1) File another 602 appeal, noting CDCR and Parole‚Äôs failure to give you a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law.(2) File a state petition for a writ for habeas corpus in your local superior court. State in the petition that because CDCR and Parole didn‚Äôt send you a formal response to your 602 appeal within the legal timelines, you‚Äôve <em>exhausted</em> (completed) the only administrative appeals process available to you.(3) As a more informal action, and to help create a record of what is happening with your original 602, you should:</div>
          <p><em> Call the Regional Appeals Coordinator office requesting a formal response to your 602 be sent to you (document each phone call); AND</em></p>
          <p><em> Write and send a dated and signed letter to the Regional Appeals Coordinator where you sent the original 602, </em>noting CDCR and Parole‚Äôs failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law; <em>AND</em></p>
          <p><em> Similarly, write and send a dated and signed letter directly to the parole field office where you report, with attention to your parole agent and your parole agent‚Äôs supervisor, </em>noting CDCR and Parole‚Äôs failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law. In the letter you should include:</p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Your full name;</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Your CDCR number under your name;</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>A brief explanation of the issue(s) that your original 602 appeal was about (include the date that a formal response to your 602 appeal was due back to you, and state how much time has passed since then; explain what level you are at in the 602 appeals process; and explain any other facts about the 602 appeal that you believe are relevant); AND</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>A copy of your original 602 appeal, if you have one, as evidence of your appeal. </strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>Why are these actions suggested?</em> </strong></p>
          <p>In the appeals process, it is best to have any problems PUT INTO WRITING in a formal letter to the parole office. This is more helpful than just having informal conversations, which don‚Äôt leave any documentary evidence..</p>
          <p><strong><em>Where do I send my letters?</em> </strong></p>
          <p>(1) As for the first letter to your parole agent and the agent‚Äôs supervisor, send this directly to the parole office where you report. To find the address of your local parole office, visit the Division of Adult Parole Operation‚Äôs (DAPO) website at: http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/. Click on your region to see a full list of parole offices and addresses.</p>
          <p>(2) As for the second letter to the Regional Appeals Coordinator, send this to the office address where you sent your original 602. As of now, it will be one of the following addresses, depending on which region of parole you are located in:</p>
          <p class="text">Northern Region Parole, Appeals Coordinator<br/>9825 Goethe Road, Ste. 200<br/>Sacramento, CA 95827-2572 </p>
          <p class="text">Southern Region Parole, Appeals<br/>21015 Pathfinder Road Ste. 200<br/>Diamond Bar, CA 91765</p>
          <h3>after filing a 602 appeal about my parole term, I have exhausted (completed) the administrative Appeals process. Can I now take my appeal to court?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes. If your 602 appeal was denied at all three levels of administrative review, OR if you still have not received a formal response from CDCR/Parole after an unreasonable delay, you have exhausted (completed) the administrative appeals process. If you want to continue challenging your parole term, you can now file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the county of your parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-536" id="footnote-ref-536">[514]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">Through a habeas corpus proceeding, an incarcerated person or someone on parole can ask a court for ‚Äúinjunctive relief.‚Äù This means you ask a judge to order that prison or parole officials DO something or STOP DOING something. For example, a court could order parole officials to drop an illegal parole condition OR to fix a parole term length miscalculation. For details on how to file a habeas corpus petition, see Appendix¬†K, PG.¬†314.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">REAL-LIFE PRACTICE TIP<br/>for 602 appeals</h4>
          <p class="textbox">In real life, what often happens is this: The Regional Appeals Coordinator sends a formal written response to a 602 appeal, but it doesn‚Äôt actually get delivered to the parolee who filed it. Sometimes the formal response is sent to a parole agent, who then fails to hand it over to the parolee. If something like this happens in your case, and you have not physically received a formal written response to your 602 appeal, then according to the law, CDCR/Parole has NOT provided you with a formal written response as required. After 30 working days are up, you can try asking your parole agent where the formal response to your 602 is and request a copy be sent to you immediately. But if an unreasonable amount of time passes, and you still don‚Äôt get a formal response, then you have exhausted (completed) the administrative appeals process and can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus (or file a second 602 appeal about the delay). See PG.¬†171 for detailed information about what to do if you don‚Äôt hear back within the legal time limits. Please note: A short delay probably won‚Äôt be seen as ‚Äúunreasonable,‚Äù and probably won‚Äôt count as ‚Äúexhausting‚Äù the administrative appeals process. For example, if the formal response to your appeal was only a few days or a week late; or if it was filed away by mistake, but your parole agent immedieately fixed the mistake by handing you a copy when you asked. But if a month or more has passed since your formal response was due, this looks more like an unreasonable delay and is likely to be considered exhaustion, allowing you to take the case to state court. Please also note: The Regional Appeals Coordinator‚Äôs response to your 602 appeal, discussed in this box, is different and separate than the parole agent‚Äôs written response to your Form 22 request.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152829"></a>How can I challenge a<em> </em>parole condition that is a problem for me because of my disability?</h3>
          <p>If you cannot satisfy a parole condition because of a disability you have, or if the parole condition is unfair to you because of your disability, the steps to challenge that condition are different than the appeals process discussed on PG.¬†188. First, figure out which agency put the condition on you ‚Äî Parole or the BPH ‚Äî and then follow the proper steps described below:</p>
          <p class="text">IF THE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED BY PAROLE: Fill out and file a CDCR Form 1824 Request (see a sample Form 1824 in Appendix¬†Q, PG.¬†327). To learn more about this procedure, go to the section on ‚ÄúDISABILITIES‚Äù at PG.¬†198.</p>
          <p class="text">IF THE CONDITION WAS IMPOSED BY THE BPH: Fill out BPH Form 1074 ‚ÄúRequest for Reasonable Accommodation‚Äù (see a sample Form 1074 in Appendix¬†R, PG.¬†330), and send it to:</p>
          <p>BPH ADA COORDINATOR</p>
          <p>1515 K Street, Suite 600</p>
          <p>Sacramento, CA 95814</p>
          <p>If the BPH does not respond in a way that solves the issue, you can submit an appeal to the second and third levels of review. (Note: You don‚Äôt need to file an appeal to challenge most conditions imposed by the BPH, but you do if the condition relates to your disability.)</p>
          <p>Find the forms you need online here: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/BOPH/Inmates_w_Disabilities_Resource.html">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/BOPH/Inmates_w_Disabilities_Resource.html</a></p>
          <p><em>IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHETHER PAROLE OR THE BPH IMPOSED THE CONDITION ON YOU: </em></p>
          <p>Ask your parole agent if it was Parole or the BPH. </p>
