  <p>
    What documents do I need before I apply for any job?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should get: (1) official ID and (2) copies of your criminal records to review.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OFFICIAL FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before you apply for any job, you should begin the process of applying for basic government-issued IDs. (To learn more about different forms of official ID, see the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21.) In most cases, you will need at least:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A government-issued ID (such as a driver license / state ID, PG. 48, or passport, PG. 70), AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    EITHER your Social Security Number (SSN) (PG. 41) OR your Birth Certificate (PG. 32).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You will need these ID documents when you apply for a job and complete the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9, which all employees in the United States must fill out. Form I-9 proves you are legally allowed to work in the country. Your employer should give you this form to fill out. See Appendix A, PG. 767, for more information about Form I-9.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Please note that the employer cannot keep your documents, but may make a photocopy of them for your employment file.[1732]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    COPIES OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should get copies of your criminal records so that you know what employers are likely to find out if/when they run a background check. This will help you prepare to answer questions about your history and to address any concerns an employer may have. It’s also good to get a copy of your official criminal record (called a “RAP Sheet”) just for you, to make sure that all the information is accurate, and to correct errors if you find them. See UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132, for information about how to get a copy of your RAP sheet. See PG. 706, below, to learn more about background checks and what information your employer can see.[1733]
