        <h1>What can I do if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) violates my rights in accessing and using my drug treatment information?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153186"></a>What can I do if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) violates my rights in accessing and using my drug treatment information?</h3>
        <p class="text">If you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG. 417) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to PG. 408 of this HOUSING CHAPTER to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.</p>
        <h4 class="subheading3">(2) GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED OWNERS’ ACCESS TO RECORDS:</h4>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153187"></a>What can owners of federal government-assisted housing see? How do they get my criminal records? </h3>
        <p class="text">Most owners of government-assisted housing—just like most private landlords—get your criminal records from background check reports (a.k.a. “tenant reports”) run by private background check companies (a.k.a. “tenant screening” companies), public records and Internet searches, or by asking you directly in your application or interview.</p>
        <ol class="text">Unlike PHAs, owners of government-assisted housing CANNOT get records about you directly from the National Crime Information Center, state and local police departments, or other law enforcement agencies. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Also, owners of government-assisted housing CANNOT<em> </em>get your criminal records directly from the PHA.<span class="followedhyperlink"> </span>In fact, PHAs are not allowed to disclose information about your criminal conviction history to owners of government-assisted housing.<span class="followedhyperlink"> </span>If an owner wants details about your record, s/he must do his/her own research to get them (with one exception, see side box).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1224" id="footnote-ref-1224">[1194]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
        <p class="textbox">* THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE: Owners of Project-Based Section 8 housing (which is a government-assisted program where the financial subsidy for the housing <em>stays with the unit</em>, as opposed to the traditional Section 8 voucher that moves around with the person) can ask the PHA about your criminal history information BUT <em>cannot</em> get copies of the actual records from the PHA.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1225" id="footnote-ref-1225">[1195]</a></sup></sup> The PHA may disclose information to the owner only to the extent necessary to help him/her decide whether you can be denied or evicted from the assisted housing unit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1226" id="footnote-ref-1226">[1196]</a></sup></sup> Lastly, if the PHA is screening your criminal history information for an owner of Project-Based Section 8 housing, the PHA must apply the property owner’s own policy, not the PHA’s policy, in making that determination.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1227" id="footnote-ref-1227">[1197]</a></sup></sup> So if the owner doesn’t or can’t consider something, the PHA cannot either. <em>In practice,</em> Most owners of project-based Section 8 housing units are <em>not</em> using PHAs to obtain criminal history information; instead, these owners are using private background check companies to get information on applicants (see PG. 426 for more info on the rules governing tenant reports in California).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1228" id="footnote-ref-1228">[1198]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <h4 class="subheading3">(3) Limits on Both Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and Owners of Government-Assisted housing:</h4>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153188"></a>Can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing get records of my arrests that didn't lead to convictions? </h3>
        <p class="text">No. Under California state law, police and law enforcement agencies, and private background check companies cannot share information about arrests that did not lead to a conviction—unless the charges are still pending. They CAN ONLY report arrests that are <em>pending</em> AND/OR <em>led to a conviction</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1229" id="footnote-ref-1229">[1199]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <p class="text">Unfortunately, private companies hired to do background checks <em>often</em> report arrests anyway—which is against the law. Because this is such a big problem, there are lawyers working to sue reporting agencies that are illegally reporting arrest records.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1230" id="footnote-ref-1230">[1200]</a></sup></sup></span> When you get a copy of your report, check to make sure there are no arrests on it that did not lead to a conviction. If you see any, you can contact the company and demand that it remove that information immediately! See the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132, for more information about clearing up errors in your record and taking legal action with private companies that break the law.</p>
