  <p>
    What is a violation of my federal probation or supervised release?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is a violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release (SR) if you break any law or disobey any condition of your post-release supervision. Read about conditions of Federal Probation (PG. 239) and Supervised Release (PG. 251) above.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your probation officer thinks you have broken one of your conditions of supervision, you may be charged with a violation.[856]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the judge finds that you have violated one of your conditions of supervision, you could go to prison.[857] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are having trouble with your Probation officer, or if you think you are in danger of being violated, you should call your attorney. If you have retained a private attorney, you should call him or her. If you don’t have a private attorney, you should call the Federal Public Defender in you District. Often an attorney can help you resolve a supervision problem before there is a formal violation charge.[858]
