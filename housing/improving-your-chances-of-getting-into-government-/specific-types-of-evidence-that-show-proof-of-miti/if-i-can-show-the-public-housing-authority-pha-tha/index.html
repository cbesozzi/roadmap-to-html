          <h3><a id="_Toc448153162"></a>If I can show the Public Housing Authority (PHA) that I really need the housing, will that help my application?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you need the housing badly due to a <em>disability</em> or because you are <em>homeless</em>, you should let the PHA know, as those needs might help your application to be processed faster. </p>
          <p class="text">Beyond these situations, however, information about how you really need the housing or the fact that you can’t afford other housing in the area won’t hurt or help you because it’s usually not enough of a reason to overcome your criminal record. If you’re not sure, you can go ahead and mention the need in the application.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">SPECIAL NOTE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES &amp; SPECIAL NEEDS: </h4>
          <p class="text">If the housing unit has unique characteristics that you need, you should request that the unit be kept open while your application is being reviewed, especially if you are challenging a denial of your application. This means that the PHA or owner agrees not to rent the unit to someone else until your application is decided. You wouldn’t want to win the right to live in the unit, just to have it lost to another renter while you challenge the unlawful denial. A PHA or owner will balance such a request with the need to rent vacant units. Go to PG. 392 to learn more about getting into housing if the crime you committed was caused by a disability (like mental illness or past addiction).</p>
