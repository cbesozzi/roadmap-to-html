          <ol class="text">You cannot commit another federal, state, or local crime during the entire length of your federal probation. The court must make this condition known and clear to you.</ol>
          <ol class="text">You cannot unlawfully use a controlled substance. </ol>
          <ol class="text">You must submit to one drug test within 15 days of release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court).</ol>
