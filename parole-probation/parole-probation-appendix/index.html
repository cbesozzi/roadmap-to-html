          <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="PP_TOC_C"></a>Learn <a id="calculateSTATEparoleDISCHARGE"></a>How To Calculate Your State Parole Discharge Date</div>
          <p><strong>(Excerpted with slight modifications from Prison Law Office, The Parolee Rights Handbook, August 2013, available for download on their website at: </strong><a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf">http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf</a><strong>)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>FOR PEOPLE ON STATE PAROLE:<br/>How Is the Parole Discharge Date Calculated?</strong></p>
          <p class="text">A parolee who is not serving life-long parole and who is retained past the “presumptive discharge date” can calculate when he or she must be discharged from parole. There are two important dates: the “controlling discharge date” (CDD) and the “maximum discharge date” (MDD). The CDD is the date that a parolee is currently set to be discharged from parole if nothing changes. The MDD is the maximum parole term as set by statute, after which the parolee must be discharged. </p>
          <p class="text">Two types of events may change the CDD and MDD:</p>
          <ol class="text">Time during which a parolee absconds or is unavailable for supervision does not count toward either the CDD or MDD. There is no limit on how long the CDD and MDD can be extended due to absconding or unavailability.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Time served in custody for parole revocation terms will extend the CDD, but only until the MDD is reached.</ol>
          <p class="text">The pieces of information a parolee needs to figure out his or her CDD and MDD are: (1) the initial parole date; (2) the base and maximum parole terms that apply to his or her case (see Section 16.A, above); (3) how much time he or she has been unavailable for supervision, if any; and (4) the amount of time he or she has served in custody on parole violations. </p>
          <p class="text">Here is a calculation worksheet that can be used by any parolee, with an example of a calculation for a parolee named Joe who is serving a three-year parole term with a maximum term of four years following a determinate sentence for a non-serious, non-violent, non-sex offense. </p>
          <p><strong>Worksheet</strong></p>
          <table><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Start with the date the parolee was first paroled. For our example, Joe paroled on January 1, 2013.</strong></p></td><td><p>1/1/2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Add the amount of time the parolee must serve before a presumptive discharge review. Joe has a presumptive discharge date of six months plus 30 days, and was eligible for early discharge on July 1, 2013.</strong></p></td><td><p>7/1/2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>However, the BPH acted to retain Joe on parole, so his CDD will be set by his full statutory base parole period. Joe has a three-year base parole period, so his CDD is January 1, 2016. Joe has a statutory maximum parole term of four years, so his MDD is January 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>1/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>1/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe absconded from parole, and the “clock” on his parole term stopped running during that time. This extends both the CDD and the MDD. Joe absconded for three months, so his CDD is now April 1, 2016, and his MDD is now April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>4/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe also violated parole and served a parole revocation term in custody. This extends the CDD but only until the MDD is reached. Joe’s revocation term was 180 days, but he only served 90 days in jail because he behaved well and got good conduct credits. Thus, 90 days is added to his CDD, which is now July 1, 2016.

The panel or board shall release the person within one year of the date of the revocation unless it determines that the circumstances and gravity of the parole violation are such that consideration of the public safety requires a lengthier period of incarceration or unless there is a new prison commitment following a conviction.</p>
          <p>(D) The provisions of<span class="space"> </span>Section 3042<span class="space"> </span>shall not apply to any hearing held pursuant to this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(5)</p>
          <p>(A) The Board of Parole Hearings shall consider the request of any inmate whose commitment offense occurred prior to July 1, 2013, regarding the length of his or her parole and the conditions thereof.</p>

The date of the maximum statutory period of parole under this subdivision and paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) shall be computed from the date of initial parole and shall be a period chronologically determined. Time during which parole is suspended because the prisoner has absconded or has been returned to custody as a parole violator shall not be credited toward any period of parole unless the prisoner is found not guilty of the parole violation. However, the period of parole is subject to the following:</p>
          <p>(A) Except as provided in<span class="space"> </span>Section 3064, in no case may a prisoner subject to three years on parole be retained under parole supervision or in custody for a period longer than four years from the date of his or her initial parole.</p>

          <p>(7) The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall meet with each inmate at least 30 days prior to his or her good time release date and shall provide, under guidelines specified by the parole authority or the department, whichever is applicable, the conditions of parole and the length of parole up to the maximum period of time provided by law. The inmate has the right to reconsideration of the length of parole and conditions thereof by the department or the parole authority, whichever is applicable. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the board may impose as a condition of parole that a prisoner make payments on the prisoner's outstanding restitution fines or orders imposed pursuant to subdivision (a) or (c) of Section 13967 of the Government Code, as operative prior to September<span class="space"> </span>28, 1994, or<span class="space"> </span>subdivision (b)<span class="space"> </span>or<span class="space"> </span>(f) of Section 1202.4.</p>
          <p>(8) For purposes of this chapter, and except as otherwise described in this section, the board shall be considered the parole authority.</p>
          <p>(9)</p>
          <p>(A) On and after July 1, 2013, the sole authority to issue warrants for the return to actual custody of any state prisoner released on parole rests with the court pursuant to<span class="space"> </span>Section 1203.2, except for any escaped state prisoner or any state prisoner released prior to his or her scheduled release date who should be returned to custody, and<span class="space"> </span>Section 5054.1<span class="space"> </span>shall apply.</p>
          <p>(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any warrant issued by the Board of Parole Hearings prior to July 1, 2013, shall remain in full force and effect until the warrant is served or it is recalled by the board. All prisoners on parole arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by the board shall be subject to a review by the board prior to the department filing a petition with the court to revoke the parole of the petitioner.</p>
          <p>(10) It is the intent of the Legislature that efforts be made with respect to persons who are subject to<span class="space"> </span>Section 290.011<span class="space"> </span>who are on parole to engage them in treatment.</p>

The board shall make a written record of its determination and transmit a copy of it to the parolee.</p>
          <p>(c) In the event of a retention on parole pursuant to subdivision (b), the parolee shall be entitled to a review by the board each year thereafter.</p>

          <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS A HABEAS CORPUS PETITION?</div>
          <p class="text">Once you have gone through the entire 602 appeal process by filing your grievance with the appropriate agency OR if you’ve exhausted administrative remedies because CDCR/Parole didn’t get back to you on an appeal within the legal timeline require by law, you may then file a state-level petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A habeas corpus petition can be based on any rights guaranteed by the federal or state constitutions, statutes, or regulations. </p>
          <p class="text">Through a habeas corpus petition, a state parolee (just like a state prisoner challenging conditions of his/her confinement) can ask a court to order “injunctive relief,” meaning that the court will order prison or parole officials to do something or to stop doing something. For example, a court could order parole officials to drop an invalid parole condition or fix a parole term length miscalculation. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">What deadlines should I be aware of if i want to file A writ HABEAS CORPUS in state court?</div>
          <p class="text">There is no deadline or time limit on when you can file a habeas petition. But keep in mind that, the longer you wait, the more you should be prepared to explain in detail, to the court, why you didn’t file the petition sooner.<sup><a href="#footnote-1037" id="footnote-ref-1037">[1011]</a></sup> You can only file a habeas petition if you have “exhausted” (meaning that you completed or gone through) all other administrative remedies. You exhaust the administrative remedies by completing the three levels of the appeals process discussed on PG. 188. </p>
          <p class="text">You must file your habeas petition while you are still under some form of custody or parole. At the time you file your habeas petition, you must currently be affected by the condition that you are appealing. If you are no longer suffering from the condition that you are appealing, the court will likely dismiss your habeas petition.<sup><a href="#footnote-1038" id="footnote-ref-1038">[1012]</a></sup></p>
          <div class="questionheading">HOW DO I FILE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS IN STATE COURT?</div>
          <p class="text">Here are the steps you should take to prepare your habeas petition:</p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Your petition should include a Judicial Council MC-275 form. You can access this form at: </strong><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc275.pdf"><strong>http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc275.pdf</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>In addition to the MC-275 form, you must include the following information in your habeas petition:</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Identify the type of custody you are under (i.e. you are on parole) and the person who supervises you (your parole office and CDCR)</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Name a “respondent” (meaning the opposing party) in your case. If you are on parole, the respondent is the Director of CDCR. </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Describe why your current parole conditions are illegal (i.e. your parole term length has been miscalculated) </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>State whether you have filed any previous court actions about the illegal condition </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Verify (swear that you are telling the truth) the statements you’ve made in your petition </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Include any supporting documents, such as sworn declarations by witnesses with your petition </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you want to ask the court to appoint an attorney to your case, you should file a “Declaration of Indigence” and “Request for Appointment of Counsel.”</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>For a sample habeas petition, please visit: </strong><a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/STATEHABEAS2008.pdf"><strong>http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/STATEHABEAS2008.pdf</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
          <div class="questionheading">HOW AND WHERE DO I FILE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS?</div>
          <p class="text">Usually, you should file your habeas petition with the Superior Court of the county that you are on parole in.<sup><a href="#footnote-1039" id="footnote-ref-1039">[1013]</a></sup> You can file your petition by mailing it to the Superior Court clerk. Remember: any time you file documents with the superior court clerk, you should include an extra copy of the cover page along with a self-addressed stamped envelope so that the clerk can send you a copy with the date of filing and your case number. </p>
          <p class="text">If the court determines that you case should proceed, you will have to “serve” the opposing party. Serving the opposing party means that you will have to send CDCR a copy of your petition along with a “Proof of Service” form that verifies that you have served the document. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">HOW CAN I HAVE AN ATTORNEY APPOINTED TO MY CASE?</div>
          <p class="text">You can request an attorney by filing a “Declaration of Indigency” and “Request for Appointment of Counsel.”</p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHEN WILL I HEAR BACK FROM THE COURT ABOUT MY PETITION?</div>
          <p class="text">The judge must act within 60 days from the day you file your petition.<sup><a href="#footnote-1040" id="footnote-ref-1040">[1014]</a></sup> Note: Unless the court orders an Order to Show Cause (OSC), you do not have the right to an attorney. But if the court does issue an OSC, it must appoint an attorney to your case if you cannot afford one. See below for more information on OSCs.</p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT CAN THE COURT DO WITH MY PETITION?	</div>
          <p class="text">The judge at the state court may take the following actions in response to your petition:</p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Deny your petition: If the court denies your petition, it must explain the reasons why it is denying your petition</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Request an informal response from the respondent (the opposing party): If the court thinks your case may have merit, but the court still wants more information prior to taking any actions, the court can ask both parties to submit informal briefings. Your reply can be as simple as a letter back to the court (you must also serve the opposing party with a copy of your response). Your response will be due 15 days after the date that the court requested an informal response (unless the court specifies another due date).<sup><a href="#footnote-1041" id="footnote-ref-1041">[1015]</a></sup> </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Issue an “Order to Show Cause”: This will require the opposing party (called the “respondent”) to file an explanation why the court should not grant your petition. </strong></p>
          <p class="text">If the court decides that your case has merit (meaning the court decides your case can go forward because you have a valid argument), then the court will issue an OSC. An OSC directs the respondent (opposing party) to state any legal or factual reasons why the petitioner (you) should not be granted his or her request. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE COURT ORDERS AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE (OSC)?</div>
          <p class="text">The respondent (opposing party) must file a response, called a “return,” explaining reasons why your petition should not be granted. The respondent usually has 30 days to file a return.<sup><a href="#footnote-1042" id="footnote-ref-1042">[1016]</a></sup> </p>
          <div class="questionheading">IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I HAVE TO DO ONCE THE RESPONDENT FILES A “RETURN?”</div>
          <p class="text">Once the respondent files their “return,” you should file a “Denial and Exception to the Return.” In your Denial (also called a “traverse”), you should deny any and all false allegations made by the respondent in the return. You usually have 30 days to file your Denial with the court and serve the opposing party.</p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS AFTER “RETURNS” AND “DENIALS” ARE FILED—THE HEARING?</div>
          <p class="text">After the respondent files a “Return” and you file your “Denial,” the court has 30 days to decide whether or not to order an evidentiary hearing. The court only has to grant a hearing if it thinks there is a reasonable likelihood that you may be entitled to relief. If you are granted a hearing, both you and the opposing party will have the opportunity to present evidence. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHEN HAPPENS AFTER THE HEARING?</div>
          <p class="text">At the end of the hearing, the court will decide whether or not to grant you the request made in your habeas petition. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT IF THE COURT DOES NOT GRANT A HEARING?</div>
          <p class="text">If the court decides not to grant an evidentiary hearing, then the court will decide whether or not to grant your habeas appeal based off: your petition, the respondent’s Return, and your Denial. If the court did not order a hearing, then it has 30 days after you filed your Denial to decide whether or not to grant your petition. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PETITION IS GRANTED?</div>
          <p class="text">If the court grants your petition, the respondent has the right to appeal within 60 days of the court’s ruling. If the respondent does appeal , he or she can request that the court’s order be “stayed”—meaning that it does not take effect while the appeal is pending. If the respondent does appeal, your case will next be heard by the Court of Appeal. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PETITION IS DENIED? </div>
          <p class="text">If the Superior Court denies your appeal, you to not have the right to appeal. But, you can, however, file a new appeal with the Court of Appeal, following the same process as discussed above. </p>
          <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS IF THE COURT OF APPEAL DENIES MY PETITION?</div>
          <p class="text">If the Court of Appeal denies your petition, you can ask the California Supreme Court to her your case. You can do this by filing a petition for review with the California Supreme Court. If you file a petition for review, the entire record from your appeal in the Court of Appeal will be send to the Supreme Court. You also have the option of filing a new petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the Supreme Court—filing a new petition will start the process over again, and the record from your appeal at the Court of Appeal will not be included in your petition. </p>
          <p class="text">If the California Supreme Court denies your petition, and your case involves any federal legal issues, you can file a new petition with the United States Supreme Court. </p>

          <div class="questionheading">I AM CLASSIFIED AS A SEX OFFENDER and want TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER STATE. HOW CAN I DO THAT? </div>
          <p>You must meet the four basic eligibility requirements to transfer to another state that apply to all people, AND you must meet additional requirements that are specific to people classified as sex offenders.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1043" id="footnote-ref-1043">[1017]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p>The four basic eligibility requirements for anyone to transfer their supervision to another state are:</p>
          <ol class="text">You have 90 days (3 months) or more, or an undecided amount of time, left to serve on community supervision at the time your application is submitted to the state you wish to transfer to;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You have a valid supervision plan;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You have not had your parole revoked and have no pending parole revocation charges; AND</ol>
          <ol class="text">You are a resident of the receiving state <em>OR</em></ol>
          <ol class="text">You have family that lives in the state who are willing and able to assist you, and you can find employment or another means of supporting yourself.<sup><a href="#footnote-1044" id="footnote-ref-1044">[1018]</a></sup></ol>
          <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot leave until the state receiving your application has approved the transfer request or issued reporting instructions.</p>
          <p>Follow these steps to request the transfer to a new state:</p>
          <p>STEP 1: Discuss your desire to transfer to a different state with your parole or probation officer.</p>
          <p>STEP 2: Satisfy the four basic eligibility criteria listed above. It’s up to the sending state to decide if you are eligible and can be approved for a transfer request.</p>
          <p>STEP 3: Complete an Application for Transfer.</p>
          <p>STEP 4: The sending state must send the state receiving your application the following:</p>
          <ol><li>assessment information, including sex offender specific assessments;</li><li>social history;</li><li>information relevant to criminal sexual behavior;</li><li>law enforcement report that provides the specific details of the sex offense;</li><li>victim information: including the name, gender, age and relationship to the offender, and the statement of the victim or victim’s representative;</li><li>the sending state’s current or recommended supervision and treatment plan.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1045" id="footnote-ref-1045">[1019]</a></sup></sup></li></ol>
          <p>STEP 5: The state receiving the application has 5 business days to review the proposed residence. If the proposed residence is not acceptable due to existing state law or policy, the receiving state may deny the application. No travel permit can be granted by the sending state until the receiving state says it can.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1046" id="footnote-ref-1046">[1020]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text">STEP 6: A travel permit will be given to you by your parole or probation officer if the receiving state has approved the new residence. Travel permits are issued by the local probation or parole office, so each office uses a different form. Your parole or probation should give you this form once you have been approved by the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1047" id="footnote-ref-1047">[1021]</a></sup></sup> </p>

          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Fresno County: </strong></p>
          <ol class="text">The Fresno County Probation Department has many types of formal probation programs to monitor your conduct. For example, if you have a drug problem, you could be referred to Drug Court, the PC1000 program, or the Probationers in Recovery program. Whatever the program or type of supervision, you are expected to obey the conditions of probation that were set by the Court.</ol>
          <ol class="text">The frequency and method of contact with your Probation Officer depends on the seriousness of your commitment offense(s). </ol>
          <ol class="text">In addition to special supervision programs, there are special programs—these are conditions of probation offered such as Work Furlough and Work Project. These special programs allow for consequences other than custody in jail for a felony or misdemeanor conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1049" id="footnote-ref-1049">[1023]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">Butte County:</p>
          <p><strong>In Butte County, there are different types of formal probation supervision units. Examples:</strong></p>
          <ol class="text">Adult Supervision Unit—Supervising low to moderate risk offenders, Probation Officers utilize monthly mail-in forms, office appointments, and program referrals to ensure compliance with terms and conditions of probation.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Field Supervision Unit—Supervising high risk offenders—namely domestic violence, gang, and sex crimes—Probation Officers utilize routine office appointments and searches, drug testing, and treatment program partnership to ensure compliance with terms and conditions of probation.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Adult Treatment Unit—The Proposition 36 and Drug Court programs supervise offenders with substance abuse issues. Probation Officers utilize routine drug and alcohol tests, office appointments, and treatment program partnership to ensure compliance with terms and conditions of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1050" id="footnote-ref-1050">[1024]</a></sup> </ol>

You should call or visit your county probation department immediately to find out what the requirements and instructions apply to you.</p>
          <p>For example only, below you can find a few county probation offices’ reporting instructions: </p>

          <p class="text"><strong><strong>STEP 1:</strong></strong> You need to contact the Probation Department as soon as you are released from custody. If you are released after 5:00pm, please contact the Department the next day. We open our offices at 8:00am and close at 5:00pm. Main phone number is: (415) 553-1706.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong><strong>STEP 2:</strong></strong> When you contact the Department you will need to provide our support staff with your full name and date of birth. If you have your court number, please provide it too. Our support staff will be able to give you the name and phone number of your assigned probation officer.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong><strong>STEP 3:</strong></strong> Your probation officer will schedule an appointment to meet with you. Please, make sure to keep your appointment and be on time. If you cannot make your appointment, you must call the day before to re-schedule.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong><strong>STEP 4:</strong></strong> Most likely than not the Court would have ordered for you to attend a counseling or rehabilitation program. You along with your officer will choose which programs better meet your needs. It is important that you contact the program and arrange for an intake session.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong><strong>STEP 5:</strong></strong> Stay out of trouble! We know you’re facing a lot of challenges and difficulties getting your life back together, but if you need help or support, call your officer before you do something that put you back in jail.</p>

          <p class="text">For those supervised by county-level probation, below are the steps for requesting a change to your conditions of formal or informal probation.</p>
          <h4 class="step">Draft the Motion and Supporting Documents:</h4>
          <ol class="text">There is no official court form for this motion. You may contact the Court Clerk in the local county superior court where you were convicted to ask if there is a local form for this purpose. Most likely there is not, so you or your attorney will have to draft an original motion. Your motion should consist of the following parts:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1056" id="footnote-ref-1056">[1030]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">(1) <span class="emphasisitalic">Notice of Motion</span>: This tells the court what you want it to do. In other words, it notifies the court that you want it to modify your probation conditions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1057" id="footnote-ref-1057">[1031]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text">(2) <span class="emphasisitalic">Memorandum of Points and Authorities</span>: This section explains the law or authority that you are relying on for your request, as well as the facts supporting your request under that law or authority.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1058" id="footnote-ref-1058">[1032]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text">In the case of a disability, you should include the following: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),<sup><a href="#footnote-1059" id="footnote-ref-1059">[1033]</a></sup> California Government Code § 11135, Civil Code §§ 54 et seq., California Penal Code § 1203.3 and the specific facts of your disability, how it affects you on probation, and what changes or additional assistance you need.</p>
          <p class="text">(3) <span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration</span>: This is your signed, sworn statement of the facts used in your memorandum. It must include all of the facts used to support your motion.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1060" id="footnote-ref-1060">[1034]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">(4) <span class="emphasisitalic">Any Supporting Documentation</span>: If you have any documentation, such as a doctor’s letter or prescription for medication, you should include these.</p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">TIP:</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Try and get to the Clerk’s office early, because there may be long lines. Make sure to bring lots of copies and a friend to help if you can. </p>
          <p class="text">(5) <span class="emphasisitalic">Proposed Order</span>: This is the document the judge signs to grant your motion and officially allow your probation to be terminated.</p>
          <p class="text">(6) <span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service</span>: Include the Proof of Service form with your motion. This document must be included with all your court papers to prove that you gave a copy of the court papers to every person who is required by law to get them. </p>
          <p class="text"><em>Need help with your court forms?</em> Ask the attorney/ Public Defender from your case, the court’s Self-Help Center, or your local law library for assistance with your motion. </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you had public defender for your case, many Public Defender offices will write, file, and argue motions to modify probation on your behalf. Call you public defender to find out whether they are able to assist you in filing and arguing your motion. </p>
          <h4 class="step">File the Motion</h4>
          <ol class="text">Once your motion is drafted, you should make at least 4 copies—an original copy for the court, one copy for the District Attorney, one for the Probation Department, and one for you to keep. The court clerk will keep the original copy for the court’s file. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Bring the original motion and all copies to the clerk who will stamp all the documents with the date you are filing these documents. The clerk will give you back your copy, plus any copies that need to be served on the other parties. Remember to make sure that the clerk stamps each of these copies! </ol>
          <ol class="text">Be sure to confirm with the clerk if the clerk’s office will serve the District Attorney and the Probation Department, or if you are responsible for doing that. If the clerk gives you back more than just your own copy, it most likely means that you are responsible for service! (See STEP 3 below).</ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">If you are requesting a change in your probation conditions due to a disability:</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">During the hearing, you (or your attorney, if you have one) will explain to the judge why your disability makes it difficult for you to comply with your current conditions, what changes you need in your probation conditions, and if you need any other assistance from the probation department to successfully complete your probation. You can also ask the court to order the probation department to provide certain assistance or other accommodations. The prosecutor will also have a chance to speak, including a chance to oppose your request for modification. For more information on disabilities, please see PG. 286.</p>
          <ol class="text">FEES/ COST: Be aware that there are always fees associated with filing documents with the court. These fees will vary by county, and you can request a fee waiver if you qualify. Check with the clerk for your county’s fee schedule and waiver request process. Note: if you had a public defender on your case, you also may be eligible to receive a fee waiver for court filing fees. </ol>
          <p class="text">After your motion has been filed, the clerk will give you a court date to have your motion heard by the judge.</p>
          <h4 class="step">Serve the Motion on the Other Parties</h4>
          <ol class="text">If the clerk indicates that you are responsible for “service,” this means that you must make sure that all necessary people (called necessary “parties”) get a copy of the motion in the proper manner. </ol>
          <ol class="text">The law requires that you give the District Attorney at least 2 days’ notice of your motion (or 5 days if your case involves domestic violence).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1061" id="footnote-ref-1061">[1035]</a></sup></sup> This means that the DA must have a copy of your motion at 2 two days before the date of your hearing. It is best to serve the motion on all necessary people (parties) right after you file it. Be sure to have the DA’s office stamp the copy of your motion that you are keeping for yourself too—this serves as your proof that you served the DA with your motion. </ol>
          <h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4>
          <ol class="text">When you file your motion, the clerk will give you a court date for your motion to be heard by a judge. You will have to attend the hearing if you are not being represented by an attorney. In most cases, even if you are being represented by an attorney, you will want to be present to show your respect to the judge and the court process. The judge is unlikely to modify your probation unless it thinks that you are taking your probation seriously—and going to your court date shows the judge that you care about your case!<sup><a href="#footnote-1062" id="footnote-ref-1062">[1036]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">If the judge grants your motion or modifies your probation conditions in any other way, he or she must state the reasons for doing so on the record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1063" id="footnote-ref-1063">[1037]</a></sup></sup></ol>

For example only, here are the instructions for people on PRCS in a couple of California counties:</p>
          <p><strong>If you are on PRCS under the L.A. County Probation Department:</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1064" id="footnote-ref-1064">[1038]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">You must report within 2 working days of your release.</ol>
          <ol class="text">You should bring the following important documents to your probation “H.U.B.” orientation:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Valid identification: Driver’s license, California State I.D., or any identification with your name, picture, or signature). [NOTE: Please go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21 if you need to get this type of document/ID.]</ol>
          <ol class="text">Verification of residence: this can be a letter or other correspondence with your name and the address where you reside, a copy of a rental agreement, or a signed letter from your landlord verifying that the address presented is your residence.</ol>
          <ol class="text">A copy of any and all document you were given by the sentencing court or the Corrections Counselor regarding your release.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Once the HUB orientation is complete, you will be given:</ol>
          <ol class="text">A copy of your signed permanent probation instructions or the court-ordered conditions of supervision,</ol>
          <ol class="text">All signed financial documents, and </ol>
          <ol class="text">A referral to your probation officer or the probation office closest to your residence.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Lastly, you will be instructed when and where to report to your local county probation office within 48 hours. Once you report to the local county probation office for supervision, you will be assigned a supervision probation officer, who will explain the specific requirements of supervision and reporting requirements to you.</ol>
          <p><strong>If you are on PRCS under the Butte County Probation Department:</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1065" id="footnote-ref-1065">[1039]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">You must report within 2 working days of your release.</ol>
          <ol class="text">The Butte County Probation Department’s supervision of people on PRCS includes: office visits, home visits, searches, urine testing, and enforcement.</ol>

          <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="PP_TOC__AA"></a>Requesting an Accommodation for Your Disability on County-Level Probation</div>
          <div class="questionheading">HOW CAN I REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION OR FILE A COMPLAINT IF I FEEL THAT county PROBATION IS NOT ACCOMMODATING MY DISABILITY, OR IF my disability is preventing me from ACCESSing PROBATION SERVICES OR PROGRAMS?</div>
          <p>Unlike for state parole, there are no formal probation policies or procedures to request accommodations or file a complaint related to your disability. Each county does things differently, and many counties have no formal procedures. You can first talk to your probation officer and explain the situation to him/her OR you may ask a judge to modify your probation to accommodate your disability by filing a motion requesting a change. </p>
          <h4 class="step">Start by talking with your probation officer and explain to him/her:</h4>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>What your disability is;</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Why it is difficult for you to participate in programs or supervision requirements; and</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>What assistance, accommodations or changes you need. </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you have to do any evaluations with other agencies or service providers (for example, if the Probation Department does a risk- or needs-assessment for you, or you have a work placement evaluation by the Sheriff’s department), you should also explain to them why your disability makes it difficult for you to participate or meet other requirements.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>If you were sentenced under Realignment and are on Mandatory Supervision or PRCS,</em> you may be entitled to participate in special programs or other services for your disability.<sup><a href="#footnote-1066" id="footnote-ref-1066">[1040]</a></sup></strong></p>
          <h4 class="step">If that didn’t fix the problem, you can ask the judge to modify your probation to accommodate your disability by filing a motion requesting a change (called a “modification”). </h4>
          <p>If after talking to your probation officer or their supervisor, you still need help because (1) you did not get the assistance you require for your disability, (2) you are unable to participate in the programs which you are being offered or required to participate in, or (3) the terms of your supervision are difficult for you due to your disability, then you can go back to court to request help from the judge. </p>
          <p>In order to ask the judge to modify your probation, you must FILE A MOTION requesting that the judge modify probation to accommodate your disability. Once you file your motion, you will have a hearing. </p>
          <p>Remember, that your motion requesting modification of your probation should include mention of the following laws: </p>
          <ol class="text">The Americans with Disability Act (ADA)—The ADA protects people with disabilities against discrimination and it requires public entities to provide reasonable accommodations. The ADA applies to all public entities, including local courts and probation departments.<sup><a href="#footnote-1067" id="footnote-ref-1067">[1041]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">California Government Code § 11135 and Civil Code §§ 54 et seq.,<sup><a href="#footnote-1068" id="footnote-ref-1068">[1042]</a></sup> which provide similar state protections as the federal ADA.</ol>
          <ol class="text">California Penal Code § 1203.3, which gives the court authority to change your probation conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1069" id="footnote-ref-1069">[1043]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">The specific facts of your disability, how it affects you on probation, and what changes or additional assistance you need. </ol>
          <h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4>
          <p>During the hearing, you (or your attorney, if you have one) will explain to the judge why your disability makes it difficult for you to comply with your current conditions, what changes you need in your probation conditions, and if you need any other assistance from the probation department will help you to successfully complete your probation. You can also ask the court to order the probation department to provide certain assistance or other accommodations. The prosecutor will also have a chance to speak at your hearing—this includes a chance to oppose your request for modification. </p>
          <p>Because the judge has much more control over the Probation Department and the terms of your supervision, the Judge can order Probation to provide you with assistance, and can decide any other accommodations that are necessary for you to successfully complete your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-1070" id="footnote-ref-1070">[1044]</a></sup> </p>

          <p>STANDARD CONDITIONS— The list of “Standard Conditions” below—while technically discretionary (not required)— are added by the judge in almost every case of Supervised Release, as recommended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the agency that oversees federal sentencing guidelines.<sup><a href="#footnote-1071" id="footnote-ref-1071">[1045]</a></sup></p>
          <p>You will likely be ordered to follow most if not all of the following rules (conditions), or something very similar to these:</p>
          <ol><li>You cannot leave the limits of your judicial district (meaning the area that the court has jurisdiction—i.e. the “Southern District o California”) without written permission from the court or your probation officer.<sup> </sup></li><li>You must file a written report with your probation officer within the first 5 days of each month, or as directed by your probation officer.</li><li>You must truthfully answer any questions and follow any instructions that your probation officer asks of you.</li><li>You must meet your family responsibilities, primarily paying any court-ordered child support or support for the parent with whom your child is living.</li><li>You must work regularly at a lawful occupation, unless your U.S. probation officer excuses you for school, training, or other reasons the officer finds acceptable.</li><li>You must notify your probation officer at least 10 days before you change your address (some officers will require more or less notice, so check your conditions).</li><li>You cannot drink alcoholic beverages to excess. You cannot use or distribute illegal drugs, or frequent places where others use or distribute drugs.</li><li>You cannot associate with people engaged in criminal activity. (This means you cannot hang out with or spend time with people who are committing crimes.) </li><li>You cannot associate with anyone convicted of a felony unless your U.S. probation officer gives you permission to do so. (Again, this means that unless your probation officer says differently, you are not allowed to hang out with or spend time with someone who has been convicted of a felony. Just spending time with someone who has been convicted of a felony can be considered a violation of your probation, even if you were not doing anything else wrong.) </li><li>You must let your probation officer to visit you any time at home or elsewhere.</li><li>You must let your probation officer to take any contraband that he or she finds in plain view around you.</li><li>You must get in touch with your U.S. probation officer within 3 days (72 hours) if you’re arrested or questioned by law enforcement (again, some officers will require you to report faster, so check your conditions).</li><li>You cannot serve as an informant to law enforcement without court permission.</li><li>As directed by your U.S. probation officer, you must notify other people about any risks that your criminal record, personal history or characteristics might pose; and you must allow your U.S. probation officer to notify people of any risks posed by your criminal record, personal history or characteristics.</li><li>You must pay any court-ordered “special assessment” and fines, and follow any court-ordered payment plan set up for you. </li><li>You must notify your U.S. probation officer if there is any significant change in your income or economic circumstances which would impact how much you can pay towards any unpaid restitution, fines, or special assessments (NOTE: this is a mandatory condition for people on federal probation, and a recommended “standard condition” for people on Supervised Release).</li></ol>

          <p>Your release onto parole might also be delayed if you still owe court-ordered fines or restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-1091" id="footnote-ref-1091">[1065]</a></sup> When you still have fines or restitution to pay, a reasonable plan for payment, or a performance of services if ordered by the court, will be included in your parole release plan, where feasible.<sup><a href="#footnote-1092" id="footnote-ref-1092">[1066]</a></sup></p>
          <h4 class="step">Investigation Phase</h4>
          <p>Your U.S. Probation Officer will do an investigation to make sure that the person’s release plan is appropriate. This investigation will start with the probation officer asking you questions about your release plan. The probation officer will then follow up and verify your answers. For example, if you told the probation officer that your approved residence did not have any persons with a felony record, the probation officer will follow-up to make sure this is true. </p>
          <h4 class="step">Release</h4>
          <p>After the Parole Commission approves your release plan, and a U.S. Probation Officer completes an investigation, you will be released on the date set by the Parole Commission (unless there is misconduct or some other reason leading to a change in the date). </p>

          <p class="text">Below is the process for filing an appeal with the National Appeals Board to challenge and decision to grant, rescind, deny or revoke federal parole:</p>
          <p><strong>STEP 1: You may send a written appeal to the National Appeals Board challenging any decision to grant (other than a decision to grant parole on the date of parole eligibility), rescind, deny, or revoke parole. </strong></p>
          <p>NOTE: If you want to appeal a decision denying your parole on the date of parole eligibility, you instead need to submit a “petition of reconsideration” to the USPC.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1093" id="footnote-ref-1093">[1067]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p><strong>STEP 2: Use the proper form (Parole Form I-22)</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1094" id="footnote-ref-1094">[1068]</a></sup></sup><strong> and file your written appeal within 30 days from the date of entry of the decision that you are appealing. If you don’t file within 30 days of the decision, you lose your right to challenge/appeal it.</strong></p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR APPEAL:</div>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>The appeal must include an opening paragraph that briefly summarizes the legal grounds for the appeal.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You should then list each ground separately and clearly explain the reasons or facts that support each ground. </strong></p>
          <p>If you’re appeal doesn’t meet these requirements, the USPC may return it to you, in which case have 30 additional days from the date the appeal is returned to submit an appeal that meets the above requirements. </p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">LEGAL GROUNDS FOR YOUR APPEAL CAN INCLUDE:</div>

          <p class="text">That a decision was based on wrong information, and the correct facts justify a different decision;</p>
          <p class="text">That the USPC did not follow correct procedure in deciding the case, and a different decision would have resulted if it would have followed the right procedure;</p>

          <p>The purpose is to determine whether you have violated the conditions of your release and, if so, whether your parole or mandatory release should be (1) revoked (taken away) or (2) reinstated (where you continue on parole as you were).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1096" id="footnote-ref-1096">[1070]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p><strong><em>Know Your Rights!</em></strong></p>
          <p class="text">Present Evidence: You may present evidence at the hearing. However, the presiding hearing officer or examiner panel may limit or exclude any irrelevant or repetitive statements or evidence. </p>
          <p class="text">The hearing officer or examiner must disclose all evidence being used to make the revocation decision before or during the revocation hearing. The Hearing Officer will let you examine the document during the hearing, or where appropriate, read and summarize the document for you. </p>
          <p class="text">Present Witnesses: You may present witnesses at the revocation hearing. At a local revocation hearing only, the USPC may upon your request or on its own motion, ask people to attend who can give statements that will help inform the decision of whether or not to revoke your federal parole.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1097" id="footnote-ref-1097">[1071]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text">You have the right to question and cross-examine those witnesses, and be present for this, unless the presiding hearing officer or examiner panel finds good cause for you to not be there. </p>
          <p class="text">Ask for an attorney: You have the right to an attorney. You do not have a constitutional right to have an attorney at your parole revocation hearing, but you will most likely qualify for an attorney if you cannot afford one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1098" id="footnote-ref-1098">[1072]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text">Appeals: You may appeal a revocation decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1099" id="footnote-ref-1099">[1073]</a></sup></sup></p>

          <p class="text">You have already served sufficient time in custody for the violation, but that forfeiture of time on parole is necessary to provide an adequate period of supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1100" id="footnote-ref-1100">[1074]</a></sup></sup></p>
