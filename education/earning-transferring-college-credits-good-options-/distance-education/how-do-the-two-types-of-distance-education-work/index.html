    How do the two types of distance education work?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Synchronous instruction means that all of the students and the instructor(s) participate in the class at the same time, even though they are not in the same place. This is usually done through “live” teleconferencing, video conferencing web conferencing, or Internet chats. The class is given at a set time, and everyone calls or logs in at that time to participate. Synchronous courses can offer a level of interactivity similar to that of a traditional face-to-face class.[2795] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Asynchronous instruction does not require that the student(s) and the instructor(s) participate at the same time. Students choose when they want to study the course materials or interact with the instructor(s). Asynchronous instruction is more flexible than synchronous instruction, but offers less interactivity because it is not “live.” In asynchronous instruction, course materials and communications are often delivered via CDs or DVDs, by traditional mail correspondence, or through e-mails, listservs and Internet downloads.[2796]

  <p>
    Are there benefits to distance education? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PROS:CONS:Classes and programs are available to students who cannot attend in personSaves students time because they don’t have to travel to classesOften cheaper than location-based classesOften offers more flexible scheduling Less likely to be subject to class-size restrictions (i.e. classes available to more students)Less interactivity and support than traditional classroom learningStudents must be self-motivated and self-directedMost programs require knowledge of and access to computers, Web browsers, email, and word-processing programs Some programs require continuous access to the InternetStudents miss out on benefits of classroom attendance, such as getting to know the instructor/ other students, and group discussions of views and opinions[2797]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BEWARE: Distance Education programs can vary in quality and legitimacy (quality of instruction can be low, credits/degrees may not be recognized by other schools or programs). Some programs are outright scams. (For information on how to tell if a program is a scam, see Choosing Your Educational Path, PG. 1043).
