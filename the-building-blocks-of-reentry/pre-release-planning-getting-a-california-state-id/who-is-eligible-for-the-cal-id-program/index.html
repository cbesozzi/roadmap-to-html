        <p class="text">Under the expanded CAL-ID program, you are eligible for a California state ID if:</p>
        <ol class="text">You have a set release date, AND that date is 120-210 days (approximately 4-7 months) away;</ol>
        <ol class="text">You previously had a California state ID <em>or</em> California driver license;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Your previous California state ID or driver license was <em>issued in the past 10 years</em>; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You <em>don’t owe any DMV fees</em> for your previous California state ID or driver license; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You have a <em>photo</em> on file with the DMV that is <em>no more than 10 years old</em>; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You <em>don’t</em> have any <em>active felony holds, warrants, or detainers</em> that could cause you to go back to prison or jail after your release;</ol>
        <ol class="text">You <em>don’t</em> have an <em>active Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold</em> that would cause you to be deported after your release;</ol>
        <ol class="text">You can provide an <em>address</em> where you will live after your release (note: this is the address that will be printed on the California state ID card, not your prison address); AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You provide the following information, and the DMV can make sure it’s true:</ol>
        <ol class="text">True full name;</ol>

        <ol class="text">Valid Social Security Number (SSN); </ol>
