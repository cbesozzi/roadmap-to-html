  <p>
    When could i show proof of mitigating circumstances and rehabilitation to the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IF YOU PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION UPFRONT, you will likely have a better shot of getting into the government-assisted housing program. Many government-assisted housing programs that are not legally required to ask you for mitigating or rehabilitative evidence won’t… so be proactive!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Similarly, if you are TRYING TO REJOIN a government-assisted housing unit, be prepared to explain why you should be accepted, despite your record. Because the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing is likely to run a background check on you, you should be prepared—if asked—to honestly disclose your criminal record AND to demonstrate mitigating circumstances and evidence of your rehabilitation (see PG. 417). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Consider giving the PHA or owner additional information about all the benefits of having you join your family and how your joining may positively affect the stability of the entire housing development. These benefits depend on the facts of your specific situation. For example, you might include information about your relationship with the family members currently living in the household, especially a positive relationship with any children or a supportive relationship between you and your spouse. Another example is your potential to increase the income of the family unit already living there, so that you will stabilize the rent paid to the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing. To learn more about joining family and friends—in either private or government-assisted housing—see PG. 436.
