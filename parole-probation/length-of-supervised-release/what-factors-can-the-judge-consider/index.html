        <h3><a id="_Toc448153012"></a>What factors can the judge consider?</h3>
        <p class="text">It depends on the judge. Ultimately, the decision to end your supervised release early is up to the judge who originally sentenced you. To get off of supervised release early, you must show the judge that you have earned it through good conduct, and it must be in the interests of justice.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-838" id="footnote-ref-838">[812]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Here is the full list of factors that the judge <em>may </em>consider when deciding whether to let you off supervised release early:</p>
        <ol class="text">Whether or not your Probation Officer or the Prosecutor support your request;</ol>
        <ol class="text">The nature and seriousness of the crime you were convicted of;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Your criminal history and/or mental illness history;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether the judge believes you are a threat to the public;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether the judge believes you have been sufficiently punished;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether you have completed any substance abuse treatment or rehabilitation programs;</ol>
        <ol class="text">How your sentence compares to the federal sentencing guidelines recommended sentence;</ol>
        <ol class="text">U.S. Sentencing Commission policy statements;<sup><a href="#footnote-839" id="footnote-ref-839">[813]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether you’ve paid restitution to the victims.<sup><a href="#footnote-840" id="footnote-ref-840">[814]</a></sup></ol>
