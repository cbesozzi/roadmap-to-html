        <h1>Restitution</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc352861800"></a>Restitution</h2>
        <h3><a id="COD_Restitution_PayingWhileIncarcerated"></a><a id="_Toc352861801"></a>How do I pay restitution while incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text">CDCR (or the county jail) will automatically deduct victim restitution, and, if possible, restitution fine payments from deposits in your trust account and any wages you earn.<sup><a href="#footnote-2248" id="footnote-ref-2248">[2247]</a></sup> You can also make voluntary payments whenever you like.</p>
        <p class="text">If a friend or family member on the outside sends you money, the CDCR will automatically apply half of the sum to your restitution, with an additional 10% of that half going towards paying administrative costs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2249" id="footnote-ref-2249">[2248]</a></sup> Friends and family on the outside can also send you money specifically for restitution, in which case the administrative costs are waived.<sup><a href="#footnote-2250" id="footnote-ref-2250">[2249]</a></sup> </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861802"></a>How do I pay restitution while on state parole? </h3>
        <p class="text">CDCR has most likely sent your victim restitution debt to the Franchise Tax Board for collection. The FTB will send you a demand notice with contact information and instructions on how to set up a payment plan. You can also contact the FTB directly to make payment arrangements. (See PG. 672 for FTB contact information.) If you also want to pay off your restitution fines (or parole revocation fines) voluntarily while you are on parole, you can send these payments directly to CDCR. Your parole agent can tell you how much you owe and/or answer other questions about your payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2251" id="footnote-ref-2251">[2250]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Make sure you include your name and CDCR number with your payment, and send to:<br/>CDCR—Office of Trust Accounting, P.O. Box 276088, Sacramento, CA 95827</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You must pay off your restitution in full to transfer your parole from California to another state, otherwise your transfer request will be denied.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2252" id="footnote-ref-2252">[2251]</a></sup></sup> Once you pay off your restitution, your parole agent will request a receipt showing a zero balance to submit with your transfer request. Learn more about interstate transfer on PG. 211.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861803"></a>How do I pay restitution while on probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision in California? </h3>
        <p class="text">You should ask your probation officer about making payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2253" id="footnote-ref-2253">[2252]</a></sup> You can also call the CDCR Office of Victim &amp; Survivor Rights &amp; Services Restitution Unit at (877) 256-6877 (toll free) to discuss your restitution balance and arrange your payments.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: PAY OFF CONDITION-OF-PROBATION DEBTS FIRST! Always try to pay off debts that are <em>conditions of your probation</em> first, as these can affect the length of your probation.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2254" id="footnote-ref-2254">[2253]</a></sup></sup></strong> (Payments are supposed to go to these debts first automatically, but this doesn’t always happen.)<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2255" id="footnote-ref-2255">[2254]</a></sup></strong>BUT NOTE: If you are entitled to a mandatory dismissal of a conviction under Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4 because your probation was terminated (ended) early, you cannot be denied the dismissal because you still owe victim restitution.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2256" id="footnote-ref-2256">[2255]</a></sup></sup></strong> This means that if you owe victim restitution, you still have the RIGHT to a mandatory dismissal of a qualifying conviction. See PG 945 in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER for more information.</p>
        <p class="text">Make your payments in-person, online, or by mail:</p>
        <ol class="text"><em>If you make a payment in person</em>, ask the clerk (or collections representative) who receives your payment to put it toward your restitution and any other fines imposed as conditions of your probation first.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>If you make payments online</em>, you can select which fines or fees your payment will go toward. Make sure you select the ones that are conditions of your probation first.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>If send your payment by mail</em>, write on your check or money order in the memo line—or include a note—that indicates which fine or fee the payment is specifically meant for.</ol>
        <p class="text"><em>After you are off state parole</em>, CDCR will refer the remainder of your debt (unpaid restitution fines, parole revocation restitution, court fines and fees, administrative fees) to the California Franchise Tax Board.<sup><a href="#footnote-2257" id="footnote-ref-2257">[2256]</a></sup></p>
