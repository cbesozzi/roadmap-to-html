  <p>
    What is the process for getting a pardon?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How you go about getting a pardon depends on the type of pardon you are seeking. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pardon With Certificate of Rehabilitation
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You DO NOT have to do anything once you have your Certificate of Rehabilitation! When the judge grants your COR, he will also send a copy of your COR directly to the Governor’s Office. This will serve as your automatic application for a pardon AND as an official recommendation from the judge that the Governor should grant your pardon. You will not need to do anything else to apply.[3098] Once the Governor receives a copy of your COR, s/he can do any of the following:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Grant your pardon immediately (if you have no more than 1 felony conviction);[3099]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do an investigation and review your case to decide whether to grant your pardon; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ask the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) to investigate your case and make a recommendation about whether you should receive a pardon (see below under “Traditional or Direct Pardon”).[3100] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Traditional or Direct Pardon (without a Certificate of Rehabilitation)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You need to complete a formal application for a pardon –called an “Application for Gubernatorial Pardon.” If you are not eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, or if any of the following apply to you, this is the only way to apply for a pardon from the Governor: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your conviction is from California but you do NOT currently live in California;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were released from prison or onto parole before May 13, 1943; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are serving a life sentencing without the possibility of parole, and you have 2 or more felony convictions.[3101]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For instructions on how to complete a formal application for a traditional or direct pardon, see APPENDIX W, on PG. 1258.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BPH-Recommended Pardon 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You cannot apply for a BPH-recommended pardon yourself—the BPH must recommend you to the Governor on its own.[3102] However, you may be able to show the BPH that you deserve to be recommended for a pardon. If you have a BPH hearing, it’s recommended that you bring evidence (such as documents, certificates, or letters) showing:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That you were a victim of domestic violence and it led to your offense; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your extraordinarily good conduct or amazing accomplishments while incarcerated; or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other special and unusual circumstances surrounding your conviction or sentence.
