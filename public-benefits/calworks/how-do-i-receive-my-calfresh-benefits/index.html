          <h3><a id="_Toc290125874"></a><a id="_Toc448153284"></a>How do I receive my CalFresh benefits?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you are approved for CalFresh benefits, they will be issued on an Electronic Benefits Transfer Card (EBT). You will need to set up a PIN number for the card to use it, and can then use the card at most grocery stores. </p>
          <p class="text">In some counties, people who are homeless, elderly or disabled can also use their benefits at certain restaurants through the CalFresh Restaurant Meal Program. Visit <a href="http://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/clientinformation/calfreshrmp.shtml">http://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/clientinformation/calfreshrmp.shtml</a> to see which counties participate in the CalFresh Restaurant Meal Program and to locate participating restaurants. </p>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintCalFresh for People Living in Drug/Alcohol Treatment Centers and Other Licensed Residential Facilities:</h4>
          <p class="textbox">If you are required to live in a residential facility (for example, a drug/alcohol treatment center) after getting out of prison or jail, then special CalFresh rules apply to you: </p>
          <ul class="textbox">If you live in a treatment/residential facility that does NOT provide a majority of your meals, then you may apply as a one-person CalFresh “household.”However, if you live in a treatment/residential facility that provides the majority of your meals, then you are only eligible for benefits that the facility applies for, and you MUST be certified for CalFresh through an Authorized Representative (AR). Either you or your AR may sign the application forms. The AR is designated in writing by the head of the household. The AR must sign the form “Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Request for Designated Alternate Cardholder/Authorized Representative” (CSF 64 form) and the benefits will be assigned to the facility, not to the resident (see sample CSF 64 form in Appendix B, PG. 636).<sup><a href="#footnote-1424" id="footnote-ref-1424">[1394]</a></sup> </ul>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125875"></a><a id="_Toc448153285"></a>Once I’m enrolled in CalFresh, what rules must I follow to stay eligible? </h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">EXCEPTIONS TO WORK REQUIREMENT</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Certain people are exempt (excused) from these work requirements. You may be exempt if you are:</p>
          <ul class="sidebox">physically or mentally unfit to be workingalready engaged in the CalWORKs work programreceiving unemployment insurance benefitsparticipating in a drug or alcohol addiction treatment programenrolled in school on at least a half-time basisan honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. military.</ul>
          <p class="sidebox">Contact your county CalFresh office for details. </p>
          <p class="text"><em>Purchase requirements:</em> You can only use CalFresh benefits to buy food. You can’t use CalFresh benefits to buy any non-food items such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco, household cleaning supplies, toiletries, or cosmetics, and you can’t exchange CalFresh benefits for money. If you sell your CalFresh benefits or use them for non-food items, you can be charged with fraud and you could be banned from receiving CalFresh and other food benefits for life. </p>
          <p class="text"><em>Time Limits: </em>Typically, every able-bodied adult (ages 18-49) without dependents in your household is limited to 3 months of aid in a 36-month period unless you are working at least 20 hours per week; participating in an approved work activity; OR doing workfare.<sup><a href="#footnote-1425" id="footnote-ref-1425">[1395]</a></sup> But California HAS WAIVED this requirement through September 30, 2015, due to California’s high unemployment rate.<sup><a href="#footnote-1426" id="footnote-ref-1426">[1396]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text"><em>Work Requirements:</em> As a CalFresh recipient, your county may require you to participate in an Employment and Training program, unless your county is listed as a “Labor Surplus Area” (LSA). An LSA is a county that, during the last two years, has had an unemployment rate of 20% or more above the national average. Right now, all counties are expected to be listed as LSAs until December 2016. Additionally, if you are employed, but choose to leave your job, and apply for or receive CalFresh benefits, you can’t get CalFresh for 3 months.</p>
          <p class="text"><em>Report Requirements:</em> Most CalFresh households must submit a report, called a Semi-Annual Income Eligibility Report (SAR 7) every six months.<sup><a href="#footnote-1427" id="footnote-ref-1427">[1397]</a></sup> Additionally, they must immediately report a change in address, any changes in employment, changes in people who live with the family, and anytime their income goes over the Interim Report Threshold. Failure to report within the time limits could result in an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) (IPVs explained on PG. 524).</p>
          <p class="text"><em>Recertification requirements:</em> When you first enroll in CalFresh, your enrollment will only last for a limited time called a “certification period.” This is usually one year, but in some cases it’s only a few months. If you want to get CalFresh for longer than that, then before this period ends, you must apply for recertification—that is, prove that you’re still eligible for CalFresh. Before the first day of the last month of your certification period, the county should send you a “Notice of Expiration” (NOE) that says when, where, and how to apply for recertification. If your certification period is 1-2 months, the county must give you a NOE at the start of your certification period.<sup><a href="#footnote-1428" id="footnote-ref-1428">[1398]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: To keep getting CalFresh without interruption, apply for recertification on or before the 15th day of the last month of your certification period; For example, if your 1-year certification period runs April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, you must recertify BEFORE March 15, 2015. Please note: If your certification period has expired and your recertification application has been delayed, and your household has very little income, check to see if you qualify for “expedited services” (ES) CalFresh (read more on PG. 522). If so, you may be able to get recertified for CalFresh benefits in just 3 days.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125876"></a><a id="_Toc448153286"></a>I believe my CalFresh was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? </h3>
          <p class="text">If the county denies your CalFresh application, it must mail you a Notice of Action explaining why. It must do so within 30 days of getting your application. If you disagree, you have a right to ask for a State hearing to appeal (challenge) the denial. You must request a hearing within 90 days of the county’s decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1429" id="footnote-ref-1429">[1399]</a></sup></sup> In order to continue receiving benefits during your appeal, with assistance being paid while your appeal is pending, you must request a hearing within 10 days.</p>
          <h4>Ways you can request a State hearing:</h4>
          <ol class="text"><em>By phone.</em> Call California Department of Social Services (CDSS) at 1-800-952-5253 (TDD 1-800-952-8349).<sup><a href="#footnote-1430" id="footnote-ref-1430">[1400]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>By mail. </em>Write your request on the back of your Notice, or write a letter. Then mail your request to the county welfare agency’s address, which is on your Notice—OR mail it to: CDSS Office of Hearings and Appeals; 744 P Street, M.S. 19-36; Sacramento, CA 95814. </ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>By fax. </em>Fax your request to: CDSS State Hearings Division at 916-651-5210.<sup><a href="#footnote-1431" id="footnote-ref-1431">[1401]</a></sup></ol>
          <h4>Tips to remember when requesting a State hearing:</h4>
          <ol class="text">It is best to request a hearing in writing, so that there is a record of it. Keep a copy of your request.</ol>
          <ol class="text">In your request, clearly state that you want a hearing, and briefly state your reason for wanting one.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you have a disability, note this in your request and specify any accommodations you will need—such as a need for documents to be in a larger font, or in a room with wheelchair accommodations.<sup><a href="#footnote-1432" id="footnote-ref-1432">[1402]</a></sup> </ol>
          <h4>Rights you have when requesting a State hearing:</h4>
          <ol class="text">You have a right to have the county welfare agency’s help, if you ask for it, with understanding how to appeal a decision about your case and what your next steps should be.</ol>
          <ol class="text">You have a right to a free interpreter who will explain all procedures and also interpret for you at the hearing in your preferred language. If you want an interpreter, state this in your request, and specify your language. </ol>
          <ol class="text">You have a right to choose a representative (such as a friend, family member, or advocate) who will ask for a hearing on your behalf. You also have a right to bring someone to your hearing (such as a friend, family member, or advocate) if you do not want to go alone.<sup><a href="#footnote-1433" id="footnote-ref-1433">[1403]</a></sup> </ol>
