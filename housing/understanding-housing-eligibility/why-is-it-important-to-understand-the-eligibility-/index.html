  <h2><a href="/housing/understanding-housing-eligibility/why-is-it-important-to-understand-the-eligibility-/index.html">Why is it important to understand the eligibility rules of different types of housing?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Why is it important to understand the eligibility rules of different types of housing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Knowing the rules and policies that different types of housing have for who can and cannot live there is important for you to understand whether or not you will want to apply, and what your chances are of being accepted. If you are eligible, that means you could be accepted into the housing; but if you are ineligible, something about you or your situation automatically disqualifies you from being accepted because of the rules of that housing agency or because of some law that bans you from living there. Keep in mind: it’s possible for your situation to change in a way that could also change your eligibility. Continue reading to learn more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What are some of the reasons I could be eligible or ineligible for a housing program? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You could be eligible or ineligible because of (1) your income, (2) your criminal record, and/or (3) some other specific factor.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1) INCOME: How much money you make will be an important factor for certain types of housing. If you are low-income, it will help you in certain contexts. For example, housing that is subsidized (paid for partially or fully) by the government, you must be low-income—earning less than a certain amount of money per month—to be eligible. The income cutoff is different for different programs (read more below). But for most private housing, you must be earning more than a certain amount of money per month to be eligible. Landlords want proof of your income being a certain amount so they know you are able to pay rent. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2) CRIMINAL RECORD: For almost all kinds of housing, specific kinds of criminal convictions may disqualify you from applying, or at least make it harder for you to get accepted as a tenant.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3) OTHER SPECIFIC FACTORS: Some housing programs—especially those fully or partially funded by the government—are designed for certain specific groups of people. Your age, income level, disability status, veteran status, homeless status, gender, and whether you have children are just some of the factors that could make you eligible for certain specific housing programs.

  <p>
    I was receiving Section 8 housing and was then incarcerated. Do I need to reapply? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. If you were the sole recipient of Section 8 vouchers and are absent for a prolonged period of time due to incarceration, you may be in violation of your local Public Housing Authority’s local policies and/or the terms of your housing contract.[1098] If that is the case, your public housing assistance benefits are likely to be terminated.[1099] Federal law allows individuals to be absent from Section 8 housing for a maximum of 180 consecutive days, but the maximum set by your city or county’s Public Housing Authority may be shorter.[1100] To see contact information for local Public Housing Authority branches, go to APPENDIX [] PG. [] or call HUD Customer’s Service at 1-202-708-1112. Note that you may have to wait six months after your Section 8 benefits were terminated before reapplying.
