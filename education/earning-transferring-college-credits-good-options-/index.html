<h1>Earning & transferring college credits—good options if you are incarcerated</h1>

<h2 class="subheading"><a id="Educ_EarningTransferCredits"></a><a id="_Toc448153815"></a>Earning &amp; transferring college credits—good options if you are incarcerated</h2>

<p class="text">If you completed any Career &amp; Technical Education (CTE) or college-level courses, whether before, during or after your incarceration, you may be able to apply the credit you earned from those courses toward a CTE certificate or a college degree. This is called “transferring” credits.<sup><a href="#footnote-2822" id="footnote-ref-2822">[2789]</a></sup> The new school you enroll in recognizes the work you did previously (either while incarcerated or at your previous school), and does not make you retake those classes in order to earn your degree.<sup><a href="#footnote-2823" id="footnote-ref-2823">[2790]</a></sup></p>

<p class="text">Generally, CTE programs and community colleges will accept credit from correspondence courses or other programs you completed while incarcerated. Four-year colleges and universities may accept some of these credits, depending on the program. Four-year colleges generally accept transfer credits earned at community colleges. Each school will have a different policy for applying transfer credits toward a certificate or degree program. </p>

<p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Generally, you must have completed the course within the last 10 years and earned a C or better for a school to give you credit for it. Also, you cannot transfer credits from a non-accredited program to an accredited program. (See PG. 1052 for information on “accreditation.”)</p>
