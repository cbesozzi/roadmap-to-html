          <h1>If I am eligible, how could I get a pardon?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153956"></a>If I am eligible, how could I get a pardon?</h3>
          <p class="text">There are 3 different ways to get a pardon: </p>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Certificate of Rehabilitation</strong>—By getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation <em>first</em>, a request for your pardon is automatically sent to the Governor. This is the best way to get a pardon, if your conviction is eligible for a COR. (For more information about getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation, see PG. 1184.)</ol>
          <p class="text">Remember, once you receive your COR, it <em>automatically</em> becomes your application for a pardon also. The COR also serves as the judge’s official recommendation that the Governor should grant your pardon. </p>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Traditional Pardon</strong>—A traditional pardon is when you submit your request for a pardon directly to the Governor (also called a direct pardon). This is the best way to get a pardon if you are NOT eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation. You must also apply for a traditional pardon directly from the Governor if any of the following apply to you:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your conviction is from California but you do NOT currently live in California;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were released from prison or onto parole before May 13, 1943; OR</ol>
          <ol class="text">You are serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, and you have more than 1 felony conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3131" id="footnote-ref-3131">[3095]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Board of Parole Hearings Recommendation</strong>—If the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) recommends you for a pardon while you’re still in prison, based on your good conduct, unusual sentence, or another good reasons (for example, you committed your offense because you were a victim of domestic violence).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3132" id="footnote-ref-3132">[3096]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
