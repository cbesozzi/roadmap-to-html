  <p>
    Because I have a felony conviction, but never went to prison for it, can I get it expunged?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe. If you were convicted of a felony, but you were NOT sentenced to serve a state prison term, your offense is called a “wobbler.” A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense “wobbles” between the two offense categories. If you were convicted of a felony wobbler AND you were NOT sentenced to a state prison term, your offense is probably eligible for expungement. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Wobblers” are eligible for expungement if:[2924] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT sentenced to a state prison term for the offense; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG. 1165); AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for information on the two types of expungement and their requirements, see PG. 1167). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you meet the above requirements, your felony should be eligible for expungement.
