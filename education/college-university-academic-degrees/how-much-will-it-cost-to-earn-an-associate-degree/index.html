          <p class="text">The cost of earning an Associate degree varies greatly depending on the institution that you enroll in.</p>
          <ol class="text">In California, public community colleges are among the most economical choices for earning a college degree. Technically, there is no tuition, however, there are enrollment fees that are charged per credit-unit that you take.</ol>
          <ol class="text">At the time of publication, the enrollment fee for California residents is $46 per credit-unit.<sup><a href="#footnote-2797" id="footnote-ref-2797">[2764]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">This per-unit enrollment fee is for California residents and is the same for all public community colleges across the state. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Full-time enrollment is generally 12 credit-units per week (1 credit-unit = 1hour of class time), but you can take more or less if you like. (You may be eligible for a waiver of this fee, see PG. 1088 for information on waiving community college enrollment fees.)</ol>
          <ol class="text">Private community colleges and four-year colleges are the most expensive options (costs vary greatly, but may be several thousands of dollars). </ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Tuition or per-unit fees do not include other costs associated with enrolling in a college program such as books, school supplies, and transportation. </p>
