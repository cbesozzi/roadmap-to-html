          <h3><a id="Expung_Part4_Prop47_WhoNOTEligible"></a><a id="_Toc448153936"></a>Who CANNOT get Prop 47 remedies?</h3>
          <p class="text">Unfortunately, you CANNOT use Prop 47 to clean up your record if you have <em>also</em> been convicted of any of the following offenses:</p>
          <ol class="text">A “serious” or “violent” felony that qualifies as a “super strike” under California Penal Code section 667(e)(2)c(iv):</ol>
          <ol class="text">A “sexually violent offense” under the Sexually Violent Predator Law;<sup><a href="#footnote-3023" id="footnote-ref-3023">[2989]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Oral copulation,<sup><a href="#footnote-3024" id="footnote-ref-3024">[2990]</a></sup> sodomy,<sup><a href="#footnote-3025" id="footnote-ref-3025">[2991]</a></sup> or sexual penetration<sup><a href="#footnote-3026" id="footnote-ref-3026">[2992]</a></sup> with a person under 14 and more than 10 years younger;</ol>
          <ol class="text">A lewd or lascivious act involving a person under 14;<sup><a href="#footnote-3027" id="footnote-ref-3027">[2993]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">Any homicide offense, including attempted homicide;<sup><a href="#footnote-3028" id="footnote-ref-3028">[2994]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Solicitation to commit murder;<sup><a href="#footnote-3029" id="footnote-ref-3029">[2995]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter;<sup><a href="#footnote-3030" id="footnote-ref-3030">[2996]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">Possession of a weapon of mass destruction;<sup><a href="#footnote-3031" id="footnote-ref-3031">[2997]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Any serious or violent felony punishable in California by life imprisonment or death; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Any offense that requires you to register as a sex offender under California Penal Code section 290(c).</ol>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153937"></a>WhO CAN get Prop 47 remedies?</h3>
          <p class="text">Prop 47 can reduce <em>prior</em> felony convictions to misdemeanors (<em>reclassification</em>) AND can reduce any felony sentence that you’re <em>currently serving</em> to a misdemeanor sentence (<em>resentencing</em>).</p>
          <p class="text">If you were convicted of one of the offenses covered by Prop 47 (see PG. 1178), and you don’t have any of the disqualifying convictions on your record, here’s what the change in law could do for you: </p>
          <ol class="text">If you are <em>currently incarcerated</em> or <em>on parole</em>, you may be immediately <em>resentenced</em> to a misdemeanor sentence.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you are <em>incarcerated</em>, you could be immediately <em>released</em> based on time served; </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you are <em>on parole or PRCS</em>, you could be immediately <em>discharged</em>, or your parole could be reduced to probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-3032" id="footnote-ref-3032">[2998]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you have already completed your sentence and are off parole, you may be able to have your prior conviction <em>reclassified</em> as a misdemeanor. </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you are currently on formal probation, you could have your probation reduced to informal probation, or terminated based on time served. </ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Felony Reductions and Immigration IssuesAs of January 1, 2015, the maximum jail time that a person can be sentenced to for a misdemeanor is 364 days--one day short of a full year. This could have significant meaning for you if you are at risk of being deported because of a felony conviction, and your conviction can be reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop 47. When you get your felony conviction reclassified or resentenced, it is suggested that you ask the judge to say <em>on the record</em> that the maximum sentence for your conviction is now 364 days. This could possibly help you avoid certain negative immigration consequences that are tied to a sentence of 365 days or more.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3033" id="footnote-ref-3033">[2999]</a></sup></strong> It is recommended that you contact a lawyer immediately for help in this situation. The Immigrant Post-Conviction Relief Project, run by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, offers free help to people with immigration issues related to their criminal convictions. Contact the Lawyer’s Committee by phone at (415) 543-9444 or email at <a href="mailto:info@lccr.com">info@lccr.com</a>. </p>
