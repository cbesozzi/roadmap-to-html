          <h1>Can I apply for Medi-Cal while incarcerated?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc352861573"></a>Can I apply for Medi-Cal while incarcerated?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1559" id="footnote-ref-1559">[1558]</a></sup></sup> If you were on Medi-Cal before you were incarcerated, there’s a good chance you’re eligible to reapply as your release date approaches. If you were also on SSI disability benefits before your incarceration, you may need to contact the Social Security Administration to restart your SSI checks before Medi-Cal accepts you (see PG. 484 for details on what happens to your SSI while incarcerated).</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic"><em>If you are incarcerated in a state prison:</em></span> If you’re approaching your release date and likely to qualify for Medi-Cal, pre-release staff at your correctional facility should offer to help you apply about two months before your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-1560" id="footnote-ref-1560">[1559]</a></sup> If you agree to authorize correctional staff as your “Authorized Representative” using form MC 306 (see sample form in Appendix G of the Public Benefits chapter, PG. 512), that staff person must ensure that your application is complete 60-90 days before your release, and send it to the Medi-Cal office in the county where you’ll be living Ideally, the office will establish your eligibility before your release and send you a Benefits Identification Card so that you can access health care when you get out. In some cases, there may be a delay if the Medi-Cal office needs more information from you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1561" id="footnote-ref-1561">[1560]</a></sup> Speak to the prison’s pre-release staff to find out about Medi-Cal enrollment pre-release.</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic"><em>If you are incarcerated in a county jail:</em></span> The kind of help you can get with applying for Medi-Cal will depend on what county you’re in. Most jails in California now provide some form of information and help with Medi-Cal enrollment for people nearing release. And in some jails you can even get help connecting with community health services covered by Medi-Cal.<sup><a href="#footnote-1562" id="footnote-ref-1562">[1561]</a></sup> Speak to the jail’s pre-release staff to find out about Medi-Cal enrollment pre-release.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125903"></a><a id="_Toc352861574"></a>I had Medi-Cal when I entered prison or jail. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">It depends on how long your incarceration lasts. In California, as soon as you go to prison or jail, your Medi-Cal gets suspended, meaning paused. </p>
          <ol class="text"><strong><em>If you’re incarcerated for</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>less than 1 year</em></strong><em>:</em> you can reactivate your enrollment by working with staff at your correctional facility before you get out, or by notifying the Medi-Cal office as soon as you’re out. </ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong><em>If you’re incarcerated for</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>1 year or more</em></strong>: your Medi-Cal gets ended, and you need to file a new application. See the next question for more details.<sup><a href="#footnote-1563" id="footnote-ref-1563">[1562]</a></sup> </ol>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintThe Medi-Cal Inmate Eligibility Program (MCIEP)</h4>
          <p class="textbox">If you are pregnant, disabled, blind, or aged, MCIEP allows Medi-Cal to cover expenses for inpatient (over 24 hours) medical care in non-correctional healthcare facilities (such as hospitals) to individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medi-Cal. Individuals can obtain MCIEP benefits as long as they are remain eligible for Medi-Cal due to pregnancy, disability, blindness, or old age.<sup><a href="#footnote-1564" id="footnote-ref-1564">[1563]</a></sup> If you were receiving MCIEP benefits while incarcerated, upon your release from jail or prison, you will be able to switch back to receiving regular Medi-Cal.</p>
