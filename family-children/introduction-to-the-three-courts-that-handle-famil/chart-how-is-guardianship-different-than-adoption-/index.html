    CHART: How is guardianship different than adoption or foster care?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The chart below explains the differences between Guardianship, Adoption, and Foster Care:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a Guardianship:an Adoption:Foster Care:A guardianship is awarded when:Parents still have parental rights. They can ask for reasonable contact with the child.The judge in court can end a guardianship if the parents become able to take care of the child.Guardians can be supervised by the court.An adoption is awarded when:The parents' rights are permanently ended.The legal relationship with the adoptive parents is permanent and is exactly the same as a birth family.An adopted child inherits from his or her adoptive parents, just as a birth child would.Adoptive families are not supervised by the court.Foster case happens when:The parents’ rights are temporarily transferred to the state but parents may be able to see the child if CPS grants permission. A judge can end a foster care placement if CPS determines that the parent(s) can take care of the child or a relative/caregiver gets guardianship or adopts the child. Foster parents are completely supervised and licensed by the state.
