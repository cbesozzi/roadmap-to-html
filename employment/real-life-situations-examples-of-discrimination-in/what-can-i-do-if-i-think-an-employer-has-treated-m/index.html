  <h1>What can I do if I think an employer has treated my criminal history more harshly than other job applicants because of my race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153453"></a>What can I do if I think an employer has treated my criminal history more harshly than other job applicants because of my race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">If you believe that your criminal history was treated more harshly than someone else’s similar criminal history because of your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nation origin, etc., it is important for you to gather all the evidence that supports your claim, especially any information showing that the employer treated you differently than someone else with a similar record. </p>
  
  <p class="text">You can also contact an employment attorney or organization that specializes in protecting employees from discrimination. See PG. 745 for how to contact someone.</p>
  
  <p class="text">The following evidence can help you to show that the employer discriminated against you by treating your criminal record differently because of your race, sex, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristic:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">The employer hired other job applicants or employees with similar criminal records and similar job qualifications; </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The employer did not require background checks for other job applicants for the same position; </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The employer gave other job applicants a chance to explain their criminal record; </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The employer made comments showing bias or stereotypes about you, based on your race, sex, religion, or national origin, including group stereotypes about crime; or</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The only major difference between you and other applicants or employees who were treated more favorably than you (such as job applicants chosen over you, former employees, and employees in positions similar to the position you applied for), is your race, sex, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristic;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Information about the employer’s overall workforce (i.e., other employees), job applicants, application procedures, and background check data, shows that the employer treated your criminal history more negatively than other applicants/employees of other races, sex, religions, or national origin; and/or</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Any other information showing that the employer treated you differently than other job applicants with similar qualifications and a similar criminal record, because of your race, sex, religion, or national origin.<sup><a href="#footnote-1900" id="footnote-ref-1900">[1870]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><strong>I am formerly incarcerated, and I was fired or denied employment because of my visible tattoos. Do I have any legal protections against discrimination?</strong></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Most likely, no. There are no legal protections from employment discrimination based on an employee’s visible tattoos. Both California state and federal employment discrimination laws specify certain “protected classes” such as gender, religion, race, and sexual orientation. Neither California nor federal law, however, protect against discrimination based on an applicant’s visible tattoos. Therefore, employers can legally deny you employment based on your tattoos.  </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">There have, however been cases of people bringing employment discrimination claims involving tattoos, when they are protected by one of the specified classes. For example, courts have found protections for religious tattoos, as “religion” is a protected class.<sup><a href="#footnote-1901" id="footnote-ref-1901">[1871]</a></sup> Plaintiffs have also been successful bringing claims based on gender discrimination, when employers take adverse action against men with tattoos, but not women.<sup><a href="#footnote-1902" id="footnote-ref-1902">[1872]</a></sup> </ol>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS</h4>
  
  <ul class="textbox">An employer CANNOT discriminate against you based on your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic.An employer CANNOT weigh your criminal history more heavily than another applicant’s similar criminal history because of your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic.An employer CANNOT deny employment to everyone with a criminal history.An employer, however, CAN justify a hiring policy against people with criminal histories if it shows the policy is “job related” and “consistent with business necessity.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1903" id="footnote-ref-1903">[1873]</a></sup> An employer SHOULD evaluate your individual circumstances and consider: Facts and circumstances surrounding your offense;The number of convictions in your history;Your age at the time of conviction / release;If you have held the same type of job, post-conviction, without incidents;Your employment history before and after conviction;Your rehabilitation efforts;Employment or character references and any other information pointing to your fitness for the position; andWhether you are bonded.<sup><a href="#footnote-1904" id="footnote-ref-1904">[1874]</a></sup>An employer SHOULD give you notice that you were denied employment because of your criminal history, and give you a chance to show that it should make an exception for you based on your individual circumstances.</ul>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153454"></a>What can I do if I feel I was illegally discriminated against? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">If you think that an employer has illegally discriminated against you either because of a complete ban against people with criminal records or by treating your record negatively because of your race, sex, religion, or national origin, etc., you can report the employer to the EEOC or DFEH as soon as possible. (Remember, the EEOC and DFEH are the government civil rights agencies responsible for enforcing your rights against discrimination.)</p>
  
  <p class="text">You may want to talk to a legal aid or employment attorney, or non-profit advocacy organization about your situation. However, you will still have to go through the EEOC or DFEH first, before you are allowed to file a lawsuit in court against the employer. For this reason, it is recommended that you contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately, and then you can talk to a lawyer as well. For more information about finding a legal aid or employment attorney or non-profit organization, see PG. 745. For more information about filing a lawsuit, see PG. 739.</p>
  
  <p class="text">You must contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately because there are strict time limits for filing an employment discrimination complaint. In California, you only have 300 days (10 months) to report discrimination to the EEOC, or 1 year to report discrimination to the DFEH.<sup><a href="#footnote-1905" id="footnote-ref-1905">[1875]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">File a Complaint by Contacting the federal EEOC:</h4>
  
  <p class="textbox">If you decide to file a claim, you can contact the EEOC in person or by mail to report the employment discrimination and file a complaint.</p>
  
  <ul class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">In person:</span> The EEOC has local offices in the following California cities: Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. Contact the local EEOC office near you to report discrimination and file a complaint. (See Appendix L, PG. 792 for local EEOC office addresses and phone numbers.) You can also call 1-800-669-4000 to give basic information about your situation, and then a local office will follow up with you about filing a complaint. (Important: You cannot actually file an EEOC complaint by phone, but you can get the process started.)<span class="emphasisitalic">By Mail:</span> You can mail a written complaint to any local EEOC office. For instructions on how to write a complaint, see PG. 739, below. For a list of local EEOC offices and addresses, see Appendix L, PG. 792. </ul>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">File a Complaint by Contacting the California DFEH:</h4>
  
  <p class="textbox">You can contact the DFEH by mail, by phone, or online to report the discrimination and file a “Pre-Complaint Inquiry”:</p>
  
  <ul class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">By Mail:</span> Fill out the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form and mail it to any local DFEH office. For a list of local DFEH offices and addresses, see Appendix M, PG. 793. To learn how to obtain the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form, see Appendix N, PG. 794. <sup><a href="#footnote-1906" id="footnote-ref-1906">[1876]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">By Phone:</span> Call the DFEH Communication Center at (800) 884-1684. If you have a hearing impairment, please call 800-884-1684 or TTY at (800) 700-2320 for service.<span class="emphasisitalic">Online:</span> Use the DFEH’s online system, available at <a href="http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/">http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/</a>, or email the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form to contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov.</ul>
  
  <p class="text"><strong>Once you file a complaint with the EEOC and/or the DFEH, you have 2 options:</strong></p>
  
  <ol class="text">You can ask the EEOC or DFEH to investigate and resolve the discrimination claim, including filing a lawsuit in court on your behalf; OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">You can file a lawsuit directly in court on your own, but you must ask the EEOC or DFEH to give you a “Right to Sue” letter. (Note: You cannot go directly to court—the law requires you to go through the DFEH or EEOC first.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1907" id="footnote-ref-1907">[1877]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <p class="text">For more information on how to file a complaint with the EEOC or the DFEH and a summary of the complaint process, see PG. 739 below. For a complete description of the EEOC and DFEH complaint processes, see Appendix O, PG. 795 (EEOC Complaint Process), and Appendix P, PG. 797 (DFEH Complaint Process). For more information about the process of filing a lawsuit in court, see PG. 744.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="EM_LegalRemedies_Discrimination"></a><a id="_Toc448153455"></a>What kinds of remedies might I get if an employer illegally discriminated against me? </h3>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox">Limits On Compensatory &amp; Punitive Damages:</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">There are limits on the amount of compensatory and punitive damages a person can recover. These limits depend on the size of the employer:</p>
  
  <ul class="sidebox">For employers with 15-100 employees, the limit is $50,000.For employers with 101-200 employees, the limit is $100,000.For employers with 201-500 employees, the limit is $200,000.For employers with more than 500 employees, the limit is $300,000.</ul>
  
  <p class="sidebox">42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3)</p>
  
  <p class="text">The types of remedies that might be available to you will depend upon what the employer did (the “discriminatory action”) and how it affected you. For example, if an employer refused to hire you for an illegally discriminatory reason, the remedy may include hiring you for the job or giving you any back pay or benefits that you would have received if you had been hired. If you filed a lawsuit in court, you may also get back any money you spent on attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and court costs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1908" id="footnote-ref-1908">[1878]</a></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">You also may be awarded “compensatory” or “punitive damages.” For intentional cases of discrimination based on a person's race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, disability, or genetic information, compensatory and punitive damages may be awarded. Note: punitive and compensatory damages are rare, and should never be expected.</p>
  
  <ol class="text">Compensatory damages repay victims for out-of-pocket expenses caused by the discrimination (such as costs of continuing with a job search) and compensate them for any emotional harm suffered because of the discrimination.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Punitive damages may be awarded to punish an employer who has committed an especially hateful or careless act of discrimination.</ol>
  
  <p class="text">In addition, the employer may be required to stop any discriminatory practices immediately and take steps to make sure not to discriminate again in the future. For example, if the employer had a blanket policy of not hiring anyone with a criminal record, they would have to change this policy and remove any language on the job application that says people with convictions will not be hired. </p>
