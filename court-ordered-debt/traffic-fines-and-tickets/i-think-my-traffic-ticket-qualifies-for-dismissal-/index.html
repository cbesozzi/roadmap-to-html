  <p>
    I think my traffic ticket qualifies for dismissal. How can I get it dismissed?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must proactively request dismissal from the DMV directly. The court will not automatically do this on your behalf. You will need to send a letter to the DMV on official California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation letterhead, and get it signed by an “Authorized Representative.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated, you should ask your Correctional Counselor or other prison staff person to provide letterhead and sign off on your request. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated and on some form of community supervision like probation or parole, you will have to ask your parole or probation officer to provide letterhead and sign off on your request.[2134] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The letter should say that you are requesting dismissal of your misdemeanor or infraction ticket under Vehicle Code Section 41500, and it must include the dates of your commitment and release (if you’re out). Send your request to: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Department of Motor VehiclesDivision of Drivers Safety and LicensingP.O. Box 9412890Sacramento, CA 94290
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A DMV employee will then review your request to decide if your ticket qualifies for dismissal. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    HELPFUL HINTHere are 3 options if you are struggling to pay your traffic fines:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Payment Plans—If you owe unpaid traffic fines, you can contact the court, parking authority, or collection agency that you owe money to and ask about setting up a payment or installment plan (where you pay off a little every month instead of everything all at once). Amnesty Programs—California now has a statewide Traffic Amnesty Program to help people reduce the amount of traffic debt owed and in some cases, reinstate a suspended driver license.[2135] Contact the traffic court in the county where you owe money for more information about the program.Specialty Courts—Some counties have special homeless courts, DUI courts, or other community courts that may be able to help you resolve your tickets and fines. Contact the local public defender in the county where you got the ticket to ask if there are any community courts available and whether you are eligible. What if I owe court-ordered debt for a federal offense?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Up to this point, this Chapter has only covered debts that were ordered by a California state court, NOT those ordered by a federal court. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have debts that stem from a federal offense, your court-ordered debt will look different, because federal courts have their own rules for restitution, fines, and fees. However, these 3 general types of debt are the same in the federal system:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Restitution: Repays any victims (people, organizations, government agencies, etc.) that suffered harm, property damage, or monetary losses caused by your actions.[2136] This is like victim restitution in state court.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fines: Serve as additional punishment for your offense and are part of your criminal sentence.[2137] The amount of the fine will depend on the crime for which you were convicted.[2138] These are like fines and penalties in state court.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Special Assessments: Fees assigned for each separate offense you were convicted of. The amount of the Assessment depends on the seriousness of the offense. ALL of your federal Special Assessment debt will be forgiven 5 years after your conviction, after which you will no longer owe this debt.[2139] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WARNING: Just like for state court debt, you may also owe additional interest or other penalties on your federal court-ordered debt (for example, if you don’t make required payments on time).
