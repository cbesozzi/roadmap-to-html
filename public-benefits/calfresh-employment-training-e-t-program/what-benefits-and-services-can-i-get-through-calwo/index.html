  </p>
  
  <p>
    Attend a group orientation that explains the cash benefit and WTW rules.[1524]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meet with a county welfare worker who will look at your work history and skills, and connect you to other services you may need in order to work.[1525] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Participate in a 4-week job search program. If you haven’t found a job after the 4 weeks, you will meet with an employment counselor who will help you plan steps toward employment.[1526] You may be assigned to: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unpaid work experience/preparation. 
  </p>
  
  <p>

  <p>
    Social Security is a federal benefits program that provides cash benefits to retired people, disabled people, and their dependents. Social security is a “pay-as-you-go” program, meaning that workers pay Social Security taxes, and these taxes are used to provide benefits to Social Security beneficiaries (retired people, disabled people, and their dependents). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For starters, there are four ways to qualify for federal Social Security benefits: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a retired individual;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a disabled individual;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the spouse or dependent of an eligible individual; or 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As the survivor of an eligible individual.
