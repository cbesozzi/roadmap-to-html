    Which one is right for me — a State ID Card or a Driver License? What’s the difference?
  </p>

    ARE YOU UNDOCUMENTED?

    See notes on PG. 49 and PG. 68 for more information!

    Both a California state ID and a California driver license serve as an official government-issued, photo identification that can be used to prove your identity, age, and legal presence* in the United States. Either one will allow you to prove your identity, for example, when you open a bank account, when you register to vote, or when you apply for jobs, housing, or public benefits. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you eventually want to drive, you will need to get a driver license, but because that process requires testing, we recommend that you get a California state ID first, so that you can get an official ID faster. Once you get a California state ID, you can always go back and take a driving test to get your driver license. But this allows you to have official ID easily and quickly.

    THIS CHART COMPARES 2 TYPES OF IDENTIFICATION: CALIFORNIA STATE ID VS. DRIVER LICENSE.

    *** A NOTE IF YOU ARE UNDOCUMENTED:As of January 1, 2015, if you cannot provide proof of legal presence in the United States, but otherwise qualify for a California driver license, you can apply for a “non-ID” license. If you hold this license, you can legally drive a motor vehicle in CA; but it won’t count as a government-issued proof of identity, and it will not prove legal presence in the United States for any purpose.[63] Also read the note on PG. 68 to learn about other forms of ID in California for undocumented people.
