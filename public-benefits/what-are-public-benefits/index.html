    What are public benefits?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Public benefits” are government programs that ensure people can get basic life necessities. Public benefits are also sometimes referred to as “welfare,” or “welfare benefits.” There are public benefits programs to help people get food, shelter, healthcare, childcare, cash for day-to-day expenses, and support in emergencies. To qualify for any public benefits program, you have to meet certain requirements. Each benefits program works a little differently and has different rules and requirements in place. Depending on your situation, you may qualify for several kinds of public benefits, just one, or none. This section explains what the main public benefits programs offer, which ones you may qualify for, and how to get them.[1336]
