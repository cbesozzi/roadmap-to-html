  <p>
    How do I apply for SSI?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can apply by phone or in person:[1629] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By phone: Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778). A representative will set an appointment for you to do your application by phone. This toll-free line is open Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 7 PM. For each time you call, record the date of your call and the name of the person who assists you. If you complete your application within 60 days of your first call to request information or materials, the SSA will treat that call as the date of your application.[1630]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In person: First, call Social Security to find a local office near you; or, if you have Internet access, use the office locator at https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp. Then call the local office to make an appointment. Unfortunately, you cannot apply for SSI online. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TIPS:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re applying based on a disability, apply as soon as possible when you become disabled. The application review process can take 3-5 months.[1631] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before you start, you may want to look over the Social Security Administration’s SSI brochure (available online at http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-11000.pdf) and/or disability application checklist (see Appendix G
  </p>

    Appendix G, PG. 659)[1632] to know what you’ll need. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you need help with the application, call the Social Security Administration or visit a local Social Security office. You have a right to assistance from Social Security representatives if you need help due to a disability.[1633] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a right to appoint any individual—such as a friend, family member, attorney, social worker, or other trusted advocate—to act as your representative in the application process. To do so, use the “Appointment of Representative” form in Appendix F, PG. 653.[1634] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some counties offer assistance with representation or referral to legal services programs for representation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you need benefits right away due to a financial emergency, ask if you can get “expedited” benefits.[1635] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can I apply for SSI while incarcerated? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes! You can’t receive SSI benefits while incarcerated[1636]—but if you haven’t applied for SSI before, and you think you may qualify, you can start the application process as early as 90 days before your release date. Keep in mind that review of an SSI application can take 3-5 months.[1637] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some prisons and jails have a prerelease agreement with local Social Security offices. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your facility has a pre-release agreement: Speak to correctional staff. They may be available to help you complete and submit your SSI application before your release. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Correctional staff should also notify the Social Security office about your release date. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ideally, if a prerelease agreement is in place, staff should start working with you several months before your release, and the Social Security office should then process your application promptly so that your benefits will start shortly after you get out. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your facility doesn’t offer prerelease assistance—and/or you have trouble working with correctional staff: Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to have application materials mailed to you and get help with them. Be prepared to give your release date. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If Social Security’s automated phone system doesn’t accept your call, you should ask a non-incarcerated family member to call as an Authorized Representative (“AR”) on your behalf (use the form in Appendix F, PG. 653 to appoint a family member as an AR). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An SSA representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.[1638] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was receiving SSI when I entered prison or jail. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on how long your incarceration period lasts—and, specifically, how many full calendar months you spend in prison or jail: [1639] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your incarceration doesn’t last a full calendar month: Your SSI benefits generally continue without interruption. Once you’ve spent a full calendar month in prison or jail, your SSI benefits get suspended (put on pause).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your incarceration lasts for less than 12 calendar months in a row: Your SSI benefits stay suspended, but you remain enrolled in SSI. This means once you’re released, Social Security can promptly restart your SSI benefits if it has proof that you’ve been released and proof that you still qualify based on income and resources. You won’t be required to show new proof of your disability—although you should promptly report any changes to your disabled condition. (For details on how to restart your SSI after release from incarceration, see PG. 617.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your incarceration lasts 1 year or more, and your SSI has been suspended for 12 calendar months in a row: Your SSI gets terminated (officially ended). This means you’re no longer enrolled in SSI. If you want to get SSI after your release, you must file a brand new SSI application, including proof of your income and resources and proof of your disability. Processing your new SSI application may take 12-18 months. (For general information on how to start a new SSI application, see PG. 605. For details on how to apply for SSI while incarcerated, see PG. 617). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Below is a chart that summarizes how the timing of your incarceration and release will affect your SSI eligibility.[1640]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IF THIS IS YOUR SITUATION:THIS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR SSI:FOR EXAMPLE:Incarcerated for less than one full calendar month:You stay enrolled in SSI. You stay eligible to receive SSI benefits. Your benefits are not suspended.You continue to get full benefits.Suppose you went to prison on February 10, 2014 and got out March 30, 2014: You weren’t in prison for a full calendar month—only part of February and part of March. So there are no changes to your eligibility, and you should have received all your benefits as usual. Incarcerated for one full calendar month:You stay enrolled in SSI. Your ability to receive SSI benefits is put on pause. After a full calendar month, benefits are suspended, but not terminated. You lose full benefits for that full calendar month. Your benefits can restart post-release.Suppose you went to prison on February 10, 2014 and got out on April 1, 2014: You lost your March benefits, since you were in prison for that full calendar month. You can keep your February benefits, since you were in prison for just part of that month. You should get your full April benefit—but it may be delayed unless you promptly notify Social Security of your release.Incarcerated for at least one full calendar month, then released after the 1st of another month:You stay enrolled in SSI. Your ability to receive SSI benefits is put on pause. After a full calendar month, benefits are suspended, but not terminated. If you notify SSA of your release date in advance, your benefits can restart promptly upon release. You can get partial payment for the calendar month of your release date.You can get full benefits for the following calendar month after release.Suppose you went to prison on February 10, 2014 and got out on May 15, 2014:After you’ve been incarcerated You lost your March and April benefits, since you were in prison for those full calendar months. You lost half your May benefit, since you were in prison for half that calendar month; but you’re entitled to the other half. You should also get your full June benefit.If you notify SSA in advance, your benefits may be available as early as your release date. Incarcerated for 12+ full calendar months in a row, then released:You do not stay enrolled in SSI. You must reapply to get SSI benefits again.After a full calendar month, your benefits are suspended.After 12 calendar months of being suspended, benefits are terminated. You must file a new SSI application, including proof of disability, which can take 12-18 months to process. You can start your application process before release. Suppose you went to prison on January 20, 2012 and got out February 10, 2013: After you’ve been incarcerated for the full calendar month of February 2012, your benefits are suspended starting March 1, 2012. After your benefits have been suspended from March 2012 through February 2013 (12 calendar months), they are terminated on March 1, 2013. If you want to get back on SSI after release, you must file a new SSI application, which you can start before your release date. BUTSuppose you went to prison on January 20, 2012 and got out January 20, 2013:After you’ve been incarcerated for the full month of February 2012, your benefits are suspended starting March 1, 2012. You lost benefits for March through December (10 months), since you were in prison for those full calendar months. Your benefits were suspended for 10 calendar months: not long enough to get terminated. So if you notify SSA in advance, your benefits may be available as early as your release date.

  <p>
    My SSI benefits stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart them? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Follow the instructions in the chart below based on your situation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BEFORE RELEASE:AFTER RELEASE:Once you know your release date, notify your correctional counselor (or another staff member at your facility) that you want to restart your SSI benefits. It’s best to start this process at least 3 months before your release.[1641]If your facility has a prerelease agreement with Social Security, staff should be available to help you complete and submit the necessary paperwork in a timely way.[1642]If your facility doesn’t offer prerelease assistance—and/or you have trouble working with correctional staff—call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to notify Social Security that you were getting SSI before incarceration, and you want your benefits to restart as soon as possible after your release. The toll-free line is open Monday to Friday, 7AM to 7PM. Be prepared to provide your Social Security number and release date. A representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to provide official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.[1643]You can also ask a friend, family member, or trusted advocate to communicate with Social Security about your benefits on your behalf. See Appendix F, PG. 653 for paperwork to complete.[1644]If you weren’t able to do this while incarcerated, call Social Security to report that you were released from prison and want to restart your SSI benefits. A representative will set an appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do. You will also need your social security number.[1645] If your SSI has only been suspended and not terminated, it may take only a month to restart your benefits. If your SSI has been terminated, you may have to file a new application and wait 12-18 months.[1646]In special cases, you may be able to get benefits on the day you walk into the local Social Security office to complete your SSI paperwork. This is possible if (1) your SSI was only suspended and not terminated during incarceration, or you filed a new SSI application while incarcerated and it was approved before your release; and (2) you can show proof of a financial emergency; and (3) you haven’t already received benefits for the month.[1647]

  <p>
    Helpful HintSSI Backpayments
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can’t get back-payments of SSI for any months you spent incarcerated.[1648] In other words, you can never collect checks you otherwise would have gotten if you weren’t incarcerated. But you should be able to collect benefits dating back to your release. So, for example, if you were incarcerated on June 7, 2014 and released on September 7, 2014, your SSI can be restarted as of September 7. You’ll be eligible for a partial SSI payment for September and full benefits for October.[1649] If your SSI application is approved pre-release, SSI benefits should be paid to you immediately upon release. If your SSI application is approved post-release, SSI benefits should be paid to you immediately upon approval; and you should get backpayment to the date of your release.[1650]
