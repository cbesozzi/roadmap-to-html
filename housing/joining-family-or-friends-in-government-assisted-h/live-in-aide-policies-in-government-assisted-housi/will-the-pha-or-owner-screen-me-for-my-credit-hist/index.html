        <h1>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my credit history if I am someone’s live-in aide?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153218"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my credit history if I am someone’s live-in aide?</h3>
        <p class="text">No. The <em>PHA or owner should not screen you for your credit history if you are a live-in aide. </em>Your credit history has nothing to do with the family’s ability to pay for the unit—so you should not be screened for credit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1265" id="footnote-ref-1265">[1235]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153219"></a>I was excluded from being someone’s live-in aide based on my criminal record. What can I do? </h3>
        <p class="text">THE <em>PERSON REQUIRING AID</em> SHOULD ASK FOR A REVIEW HEARING. Go to PG. 408 to learn how (s)he can challenge this denial of you as his/her live-in aide.</p>
        <p class="text">There may be situations in which the disabled/elderly resident needing the care has great difficulty finding a live-in aide, or that you meet some unique need of that individual requiring care. In such situations, the disabled/elderly individual needing the live-in aide may request a <em>reasonable accommodation</em> for a disability by asking the PHA or owner <em>to waive its strict screening criteria, and allow the person with the criminal record to reside in the unit as a live-in aide due to the special function he or she plays in the tenant’s life</em>. </p>
