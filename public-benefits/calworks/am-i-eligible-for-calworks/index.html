          <h1>Am I eligible for CalWORKs?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125860"></a><a id="_Toc448153270"></a>Am I eligible for CalWORKs?</h3>
          <p class="text">CalWORKs is for families with children who need support because at least one parent is unemployed (defined as working less than 100 hours per month), disabled, absent, in jail or prison, or dead, and for needy caretakers of foster child(ren).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1379" id="footnote-ref-1379">[1349]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">A CHILD OVER 18? </h4>
          <p class="sidebox">There is an exception for age limit of a child. If there is a child over 18 that is living at home but is expected to complete high school before his/her 19<sup>th</sup> birthday, you may be eligible for CalWORKs. </p>
          <p class="text">If you‚Äôre a parent or caretaker with at least one child in your home, you may be able to get CalWORKs if all of the following requirements are met:</p>
          <ol class="text">You, the parent or caretaker, must (1) be a California resident and (2) be legally present in the U.S. (either a citizen or legal permanent resident).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1380" id="footnote-ref-1380">[1350]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">At least one child in your home must (1) be under age 18,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1381" id="footnote-ref-1381">[1351]</a></sup></sup> and (2) need support because at least one parent is unemployed, disabled, absent, in jail or prison, or dead.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1382" id="footnote-ref-1382">[1352]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">Your family‚Äôs resources must be no greater than the CalWORKs resource limit.</ol>
          <ol class="text">For CalWORKs, resources include cash or property that you own, can convert to cash, or can use to support yourself. Some examples are savings accounts, stocks, and bonds. The resource limit is slightly higher for families that include a senior citizen (age 60 or over). </ol>
          <ol class="text">For CalWORKs, certain things that do NOT count as resources are: your home, household goods (like furniture or appliances), some types of trusts, and your car if it‚Äôs worth $4,650 or less. For more information, please visit CalWORKs resource income glossary at <a href="http://ca.db101.org/glossary_item.aspx?item-id=1388">http://ca.db101.org/glossary_item.aspx?item-id=1388</a>. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Your family‚Äôs income must be no greater than the CalWORKs income limit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1383" id="footnote-ref-1383">[1353]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">For CalWORKs eligibility, your family‚Äôs income includes (1) earned income, or money you earn by working, plus (2) unearned income, or money you receive from sources other than work.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1384" id="footnote-ref-1384">[1354]</a></sup></sup> For example, unearned income includes: public benefits, interest from a trust or investment, or spousal support. For CalWORKs eligibility, income does not include SSI, loans and grants, Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Federal Relocation/Disaster benefits, and certain other items, family size, and where you live. </ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Counting your income to see if you‚Äôre eligible for CalWORKs works differently than counting your income to calculate your benefit amount. To calculate your income for CalWORKs, please visit: <a href="http://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm">http://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_<br/>support/calworks/program2.htm</a> </p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">CALWORKS COMBINED WITH OTHER BENEFITS PROGRAMS: </div>
          <ol class="text"><strong>If you receive SSI disability benefits, you do not qualify for CalWORKs</strong>. However, other people in your family may still qualify, and you can apply for them. Your income will not be counted.<sup><a href="#footnote-1385" id="footnote-ref-1385">[1355]</a></sup> This means when CalWORKs staff determines your family‚Äôs eligibility and cash aid amount, they won‚Äôt count you as a family member, and they won‚Äôt count your SSI benefits as part of your family‚Äôs income. For more information about SSI benefits see PG.¬†604.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>If you receive SSDI benefits, you may still qualify for CalWORKs.</strong> However, part of your SSDI benefits will count as income when CalWORKs determines your eligibility and calculates your monthly cash aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-1386" id="footnote-ref-1386">[1356]</a></sup> For more information about SSDI benefits, see PG.¬†581.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you‚Äôre approved to get CalWORKs, you may be automatically eligible for CalFresh (‚Äúfood stamps‚Äù) and Medi-Cal.<sup><a href="#footnote-1387" id="footnote-ref-1387">[1357]</a></sup> If your household is receiving cash aid through CalWORKs, you are ‚Äúcategorically eligible‚Äù for CalFresh. <strong>This means the CalFresh Program accepts the CalWORKs worker‚Äôs determination of your eligibility based on information you gave when applying for CalWORKs.</strong> For more information on CalFresh, see PG.¬†522. For more information on Med-Cal, see PG.¬†538.</ol>
          <p class="text">Learn how to apply for CalWORKs on PG.¬†519. You may also visit the following website for tips on applying to CalWORKs: <a href="http://lsnc.net/calworks-tips-and-fact-sheets/">http://lsnc.net/calworks-tips-and-fact-sheets/</a>. </p>
          <p class="importantbox"><a id="_Toc290125861"></a>IMPORTANT: In calculating your benefits, CalWORKs may not count some people in your home as part of your family. Ask your county CalWORKs office for details on which family members are counted. Examples of people who may not count, even if they live with you, are: anyone getting SSI benefits; anyone who does not have citizenship or permanent legal presence in the U.S.; foster children receiving foster care payments; sponsored non-citizens who receive support from sponsors; anyone who was sanctioned by the CalWORKs program.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153271"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get CalWORKs? </h3>
          <p class="text">Maybe. If any of the following statements apply to you, you might not be eligible for CalWORKs: </p>
          <ol class="text">You are in violation of a condition of probation or parole, as found by a court or administrative judge.<sup><a href="#footnote-1388" id="footnote-ref-1388">[1358]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You have been found guilty of an Intentional Program Violation (IPV) involving fraud or misuse of public benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1389" id="footnote-ref-1389">[1359]</a></sup> Depending on how many IPVs you have, and what they were for, you may be disqualified from CalWORKS (and CalFresh) for varying periods of time‚Äîanywhere between 12 months to life.<sup><a href="#footnote-1390" id="footnote-ref-1390">[1360]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You are a ‚Äúfleeing felon.‚Äù In other words, if you are hiding or running away to avoid felony charges, and/or to avoid being incarcerated for a felony conviction you will not be eligible for CalWORKs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1391" id="footnote-ref-1391">[1361]</a></sup> But other people in your household may be and you will be required to be listed on the application and/or report forms and your income will be counted when anyone in your family applies for or gets CalWORKs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1392" id="footnote-ref-1392">[1362]</a></sup></ol>
          <h5 class="question">Am I ineligible for CalWORKs because of a past felony drug conviction?</h5>
          <p class="text">Not anymore. California‚Äôs law changed! Read the important update box below.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox"><a id="PB_CalWORKs_HHNewRulesDrugsConvictions"></a>Important Update!New CalWORKs Rules for People with Prior Drug Felony Convictions</h4>
          <p class="textbox">GREAT NEWS! California eliminated the ban on aid for people with past drug-related felony convictions. Starting on April 1, 2015, you won‚Äôt be disqualified from CalWORKs or CalFresh because of a prior drug-related felony conviction and you will no longer be required to report a prior drug-felony conviction on any application or report (see more on CalFresh ‚Äúfood stamps‚Äù beginning on PG.¬†522). If you applied for CalWORKs or CalFresh before April 1, 2015, and were denied due to a past drug-related felony conviction, it‚Äôs recommended that you REAPPLY NOW under the newer rules.<em> </em>To remain eligible, it‚Äôs important to follow the conditions of your parole, probation, or other form of community supervision, or be off supervision. If you violate the terms of your parole, probation, or other form of community supervision, you will lose your CalFresh and CalWORKs. (See Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code ¬ß¬ß¬†11251.3, 17012.50.) <em>If anyone in your family was already receiving CalWORKs aid,</em> your benefits should have been automatically added to your family‚Äôs April 2015 Grant. Once you are added to CalWORKs, you are also required to participate in the Welfare-to-Work program requirement (see PG.¬†555). If you were already meeting Welfare-to-Work requirements, you became newly eligible for transportation costs, subsidized child care, and other work supports. Contact your family‚Äôs CalWORKs caseworker if you do not receive a letter from the county about these new benefits and rules by March 1, 2015. </p>
