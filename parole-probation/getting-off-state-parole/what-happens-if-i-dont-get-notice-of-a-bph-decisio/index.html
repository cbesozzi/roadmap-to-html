  <p>
    What happens if I don’t get notice of a BPH decision within 30 days after my PDD?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on why you didn’t get the notice. There are two possibilities: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN 30 DAYS SINCE MY PRESUMPTIVE DISCHARGE DATE (PDD), AND NO RESPONSE FROM BPH ABOUT WHETHER I AM DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE. WHAT NEXT?POSSIBILITY #1:You didn't get the notice because the BPH didn’t hold a hearing at all within 30 days following your PDD.POSSIBILITY #2: The BPH held a hearing and decided to retain you on parole, but didn’t give you “notice” of its decision (meaning the BPH didn’t actually communicate its decision to you).If your situation falls under this first possibility, then you should be automatically discharged.[403] The law states that unless the BPH acts to retain a person on parole after PDD, the parolee “shall” be discharged from parole.[404] This means that parole ends automatically if the BPH fails to take action to retain the person on parole.[405] So, if there is no decision to retain you within 30 days after your PDD, you should be discharged from parole immediately. If it’s more than 30 days past your PDD, file a CDCR Form 22 with your parole agent and a CDCR Form 602 appeal with your parole region’s Appeals Coordinator to resolve this. For the steps on how to file these forms and start the appeals process, see the steps on PG. 194. If your situation falls under this second possibility, BPH’s decision to retain you on parole is still valid by law, even though BPH didn’t properly notify you of that decision. This means you are still on parole. However, you can appeal BPH’s decision.[406] If BPH has decided to retain you on parole without giving you notice of that decision within the 30-day time limit set by law,[407] you can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus (for details on how to file this petition, see Appendix K, PG. 314). The court may then order BPH to provide you with a copy of its decision, which you can use to challenge BPH’s finding of good cause[408] by filing another petition for a writ of habeas corpus (as noted above, details on how to file this petition are in Appendix K, PG. 314).
