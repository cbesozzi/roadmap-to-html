          <h3><a id="_Toc448153035"></a>What is a violation of my federal probation or supervised release?</h3>
          <p class="text">It is a violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release (SR) if you break any law or disobey any condition of your post-release supervision. Read about conditions of Federal Probation (PG. 239) and Supervised Release (PG. 251) above.</p>
          <p class="text">If your probation officer thinks you have broken one of your conditions of supervision, you may be charged with a violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-882" id="footnote-ref-882">[856]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If the judge finds that you have violated one of your conditions of supervision, you could go to prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-883" id="footnote-ref-883">[857]</a></sup> </strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you are having trouble with your Probation officer, or if you think you are in danger of being violated, you should call your attorney. If you have retained a private attorney, you should call him or her. If you don’t have a private attorney, you should call the Federal Public Defender in you District. Often an attorney can help you resolve a supervision problem before there is a formal violation charge.<sup><a href="#footnote-884" id="footnote-ref-884">[858]</a></sup></strong></p>
