          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a federal prison</span>: Soon after you enter prison, your Unit Team or Education Staff should review your assessment (from county jail, see PG. 1048) and recommend classes for you. If you don’t have a high school credential, the facility will enroll you in literacy classes designed to lead up to a high school diploma (or a GED, if your facility offers a GED program).<sup><a href="#footnote-2760" id="footnote-ref-2760">[2727]</a></sup> Ask your Education Advisor if you have questions about enrolling in classes.</ol>
          <p class="sidebox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are in a California state facility you may be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP). Ask your Correctional Counselor or Education Department staff if you have questions about the diploma program or VEP. Remember, to enroll in any education program, you must have a TABE score on file (see PG. 1048).</p>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a California state prison</span>: If you’ve completed some high school in the past, and if your current skills are at a high school grade level (9-12), you should be enrolled in the high school diploma program at your facility. Education Department staff will review your high school transcript (if you have one) and TABE scores and decide whether you can enroll.<sup><a href="#footnote-2761" id="footnote-ref-2761">[2728]</a></sup> </ol>

          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint<strong>Finding a High School Diploma Program</strong></h4>
          <ul class="textbox"><strong>TIP 1</strong>: Many community colleges offer dual enrollment programs or continuing education programs, which allow you to earn an adult high school diploma or equivalency certificate AND get started on earning college credits at the same time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2764" id="footnote-ref-2764">[2731]</a></sup> <strong>TIP 2</strong>: If you have meaningful school, work, or life experience, find out if you can make it count toward your diploma. Some adult schools or programs might give you credit for past high school work, job training, work experience, community service, military service, or self-study. Ask the individual school or program if it will do this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2765" id="footnote-ref-2765">[2732]</a></sup></ul>
