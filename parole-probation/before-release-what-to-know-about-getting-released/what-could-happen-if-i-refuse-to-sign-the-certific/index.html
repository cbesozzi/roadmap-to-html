  <p>
    What could happen if I refuse to sign the certificate of release?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you don’t sign the certificate of release, one of the two following things could happen:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have been granted a parole date and you refuse to sign the certificate of release (or any other document necessary to fulfill a condition of release), the USPC will treat your refusal as a withdrawal of your application for parole, effective on the date of your refusal. You will not be released on parole and you will have to reapply for parole consideration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are scheduled for release to supervision through good-time deduction and you refuse to sign the certificate of release, you will be released but you still must follow the conditions listed on the certificate of release, or risk violation and revocation (see Appendix GG, PG. 361).[897]
