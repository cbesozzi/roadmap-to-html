  <p>
    Are there any convictions that will automatically ban me from reconnecting with my child or grandchild in family court?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. As stated on PG. 894 your criminal record can be one of many factors a family court judge will consider in deciding what is in the “best interest of the child.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For some conviction offenses, the law will automatically ban you from reconnecting with a child or grandchild. For other convictions and criminal history that do not completely prevent you from having custody or visitation with your child, a family court judge will look at this history as one factor of many in deciding what custody and/or visitation plan is in the “best interest of the child.” For example, if you have past convictions for child abuse, first-degree murder of the child’s other parent, or being a 290-sex offender registrant where the victim was a minor, a judge is unlikely to grant full custody or unsupervised visitation. See the chart below for detail (PG. 921).

    HOW DIFFERENT CONVICTIONS WILL AFFECT YOUR CUSTODY & VISITATION RIGHTSCONVICTION OFFENSEHOW WILL THIS AFFECT MY CHANCES OF GETTING CUSTODY OR VISITATION?Rape that led to Child’s ConceptionJudges will not allow someone who has been convicted of rape to have any custody or visitation with a child who was conceived from that rape.[2302]Domestic ViolenceJudges are hesitant to give custody to someone who has engaged in domestic violence, and will consider any history of domestic abuse against your child, the other parent, or a partner.[2303]Other ConvictionsJudges usually will not grant custody or unsupervised visitation in the following circumstances, unless the s/he finds that there is no risk of harm to your child:If you have a conviction for certain child abuse offenses;[2304]If you have a conviction for first-degree murder of the child’s other parent; and/orIf you are a 290-sex offender registrant for an offense where the victim was a minor (under 18), or if you live with someone else who is a 290-sex offender registrant for an offense where the victim was a minor (under 18).[2305]
