  <p>
    What does expungement do?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An expungement makes it so that most private employers CANNOT see the expunged conviction when they run a background check on you. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On job applications for (most) private employers, if you are asked if you have any convictions, you can answer NO.[2901] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: On applications for certain jobs, you MUST report convictions even if they have been expunged. (For more information about who can still see or ask about expunged convictions, see PG. 1163.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Several California cities and counties have passed “Ban the Box” laws that bar employers from asking about convictions on a job application. If you apply for a job in a location with a “Ban the Box” law, the application should not ask about any convictions. For more information on Ban the Box laws, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 706.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyone else who does see the expungement will see it as a dismissal instead of a conviction, which is less alarming.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you apply for a professional or occupational license or certification, an expungement can help your chances because it is seen as evidence of rehabilitation.[2902] (Although the licensing board will still be able to see that there was a conviction that was dismissed.) For more information on licensing and certification, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 706.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An expungement may also be seen as evidence of rehabilitation when you apply for housing.[2903] Learn more in the HOUSING CHAPTER, PG. 417).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were denied federal student loans because of a drug conviction, you will become eligible again after an expungement.[2904] For more information about regaining eligibility for federal aid after a drug conviction, see the EDUCATION CHAPTER, on PG. 1083, and EDUCATION CHAPTER: Appendix B, on PG. 1106).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: If you are a non-citizen and you have been convicted of a DUI offense, getting your conviction expunged might have special immigration benefits for you. It’s recommended that you contact a lawyer immediately if you have a DUI and you are a non-citizen. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights runs the Immigration Post-Conviction Relief Project, which is dedicated to helping people in this situation for free. Contact the Lawyer’s Committee by phone at (415) 543-9444 or email at info@lccr.com. You can also try to find a lawyer to help you from the legal aid list on PG. 1286.
