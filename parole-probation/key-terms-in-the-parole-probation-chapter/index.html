          <ul class="textbox"><strong>Conditions </strong>— Written rules that you are required to follow while on parole or probation.<strong>General conditions </strong>— Basic rules that apply to all people under supervision.<strong>Special conditions </strong>— Extra rules that apply to you specifically, in addition to the basic rules that apply to all people under supervision.<strong>Commitment offense </strong>— The offense for which you were sentenced to prison or jail.<strong>Discharge date </strong>— The date you are released from supervision .<strong>Parole period </strong>— The period of time you have to spend on parole.<strong>Residence </strong>— The address where you live.<strong>Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) </strong>— A group of 12 commissioners, chosen by the California governor, who conduct hearings where they decide if a person is suitable to get released from prison onto parole.<strong>CDCR </strong>— The abbreviation for the “California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation,” which is a state government agency that runs the criminal justice system in California.<strong>California Penal Code </strong>— The collection of state laws that define all criminal offenses, procedures, and sentences in California. </ul>
