          <h3><a id="_Toc448152934"></a>Can I get off mandatory supervision early?</h3>
          <p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from mandatory supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-712" id="footnote-ref-712">[686]</a></sup></sup> It is entirely up to the judge to decide whether to terminate your mandatory supervision early. Since they are given so much discretion, some judges (and even some whole counties) are unwilling to let people off of mandatory supervision early, regardless of the person’s progress. Many judges see mandatory supervision as an alternative to incarcerating you for the whole time (that’s why it’s called “split sentencing” because the judge split your sentence between incarceration and being on mandatory supervision in the community), so for the most part they are less likely to end your mandatory supervision early as compared with probation. </p>
          <p class="text">We recommend that you speak with an attorney BEFORE filing a “Motion to Terminate Mandatory Supervision” early. If you go ahead with asking a judge to end your mandatory supervision early (such a request is called a “Motion”) and it is granted, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record! For more information on how to file a Motion to Terminate Probation early, and also how to request dismissals of eligible convictions, please see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132.</p>
