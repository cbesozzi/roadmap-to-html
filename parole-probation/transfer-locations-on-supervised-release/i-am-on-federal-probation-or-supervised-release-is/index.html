        <h3><a id="_Toc448153031"></a>I am on federal probation or supervised release. Is it possible to move while a transfer investigation is still pending?</h3>
        <div class="normal2">Maybe. Sometimes a U.S. Probation Officer will give someone permission to move while an investigation is pending. For example, you may be allowed to move before an official approval of your transfer request if:An eviction is forcing you out of your home and you have nowhere else to live but at the new address in your current district or a different district;You have a job offer that requires you to start on a specific date;Another emergency reason that requires you to move.</div>
        <h4 class="textbox">IF YOUR NEED TO MOVE IS URGENT:</h4>
        <div class="normal2">You should inform your Probation Officer and request a travel permit while the “Transfer Investigation” and approval are still pending. But please be aware, if the new district completes its “Transfer Investigation” and denies the transfer request for any reason, you would be required to move back to the original sending district.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-876" id="footnote-ref-876">[850]</a></sup></sup> If you do not move back, you will be violating the Court’s Order to follow the directions of the Probation Officer. If the court finds you were not following the directions of your Probation Officer, it can revoke your supervision and send you to prison.</div>
