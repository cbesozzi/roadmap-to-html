  <h2><a href="/understanding-cleaning-up-your-criminal-record/governors-pardon/if-i-am-eligible-how-could-i-get-a-pardon/index.html">If I am eligible, how could I get a pardon?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    If I am eligible, how could I get a pardon?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are 3 different ways to get a pardon: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Certificate of Rehabilitation—By getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation first, a request for your pardon is automatically sent to the Governor. This is the best way to get a pardon, if your conviction is eligible for a COR. (For more information about getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation, see PG. 1184.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember, once you receive your COR, it automatically becomes your application for a pardon also. The COR also serves as the judge’s official recommendation that the Governor should grant your pardon. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Traditional Pardon—A traditional pardon is when you submit your request for a pardon directly to the Governor (also called a direct pardon). This is the best way to get a pardon if you are NOT eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation. You must also apply for a traditional pardon directly from the Governor if any of the following apply to you:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your conviction is from California but you do NOT currently live in California;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were released from prison or onto parole before May 13, 1943; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, and you have more than 1 felony conviction.[3095] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Board of Parole Hearings Recommendation—If the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) recommends you for a pardon while you’re still in prison, based on your good conduct, unusual sentence, or another good reasons (for example, you committed your offense because you were a victim of domestic violence).[3096]
