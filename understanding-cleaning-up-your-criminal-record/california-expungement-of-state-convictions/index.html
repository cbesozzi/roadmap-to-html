<p>
  California “Expungement” of State Convictions
</p>

<p>
  CA EXPUNGEMENT—A GENERAL OVERVIEW 
</p>

<p>
  An expungement of a state conviction (also called a “dismissal”) is a way of cleaning up your record that limits the information that shows up in a background check[2896] and can relieve you of some of the consequences associated with your conviction.
</p>

<p>
  What expungement does:
</p>

<p>
  Prohibits information about the conviction from being included in some background checks;Releases you from most of the “penalties and disabilities” resulting from the conviction;Changes your record to show that the conviction was dismissed (but does NOT remove the offense from your official criminal record (RAP) entirely). 
</p>

<p>
  What convictions can be expunged? 
</p>

<p>
  A conviction may qualify for expungement if:You did NOT spend any time in prison for the offense; ANDYou completed any term of supervision for the offense; ANDYou are NOT currently charged with, serving a sentence for, or on a term of supervision for another offense.Note: Certain convictions are NEVER eligible for expungement.
</p>

<p>
  How do I get an expungement?
</p>

<p>
  You must file a petition with the court;You may have a hearing where you will have to persuade a judge that you deserve an expungement;You may have to give the court documents that support your request, such as letters of support, school transcripts, and diplomas or certificates.
