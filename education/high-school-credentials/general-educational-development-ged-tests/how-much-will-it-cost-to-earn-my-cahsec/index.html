  <p>
    How much will it cost to earn my CAHSEC?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    in a federal prison,[2684] a California state prison,[2685] or a California county jail,[2686] you should be able to register for a GED test, take GED preparation classes, and get your CAHSEC at no cost to you. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: While GED programs and testing are generally offered at no cost, if you have a high balance in your trust account, your facility may decide to deduct some or all of the costs for certain programs or testing from your account.[2687] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you sign up for a GED test, you must pay a $35 fee for each module (subject-matter tests) you’re scheduling. That adds up to a $140 fee if you register for all 4 modules at once.[2688] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you pass the test (all 4 modules), you’ll get your certificate and official test results by mail at no cost.[2689] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Studying for the GED might require paying for classes and books, but this could cost little or nothing. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Many adult schools and community colleges provide GED classes for free, and provide study materials for free as well. Others may charge registration and tuition fees (up to $25-50 per semester or class). Some schools that charge fees offer financial aid to low-income students. Check with each school about fees and financial aid.[2690]
