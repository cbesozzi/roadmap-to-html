  <h3><a id="_Toc328831222"></a>I don’t have any ID. Where do I start, AND when can I start?</h3>
  
  <h5 class="question">Where do I to start? </h5>
  
  <p class="answer">If you don’t have any of the 3 KEY ID DOCUMENTS — your birth certificate, a Social Security card (or number), a state ID or driver license — you will have trouble proving your identity.If you do not have ANY of the 3 key documents, it’s likely best to <em>get your birth certificate first, then your Social Security card, and lastly your California state ID or driver license</em>. To learn more about these 3 key documents:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">See PG. 32 for birth certificate</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">See PG. 41 for Social Security card / SSN</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">See PG. 48 for California state ID and driver license</ol>
  
  <h5 class="question">When can I start? Can I start if I am currently incarcerated? </h5>
  
  <p class="answer">It’s never too early to start trying to get a form of official ID. It helps to begin while you are still incarcerated as part of your preparation for release. If you are in a California state prison, a new state law requires the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to ensure that all eligible individuals have a California state ID upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This new law expands the CAL-ID Program. This program is already available at California prison facilities called “reentry hubs”; and the new law expands it to ALL California state prisons, requiring that the prison give you a California state ID <em>FOR FREE</em> at the time of release, if you are eligible. See PG. 50 for more information on this new program and what makes you eligible.If you’re already out, you have probably realized very quickly how important ID documents are in everyday life and it’s best to begin the process right away. </p>
