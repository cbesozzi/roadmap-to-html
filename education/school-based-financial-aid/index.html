          <h3><a id="_Toc448153857"></a>What kinds of school-based aid might be available to me? </h3>
          <p>Many colleges and universities have their own financial aid programs and may offer scholarships, grants, loans, or work-study programs directly. Eligibility for school-based aid programs can be based on financial need, merit, or a variety of other qualifications. You should contact the financial aid offices of the schools you are interested in to find out what financial aid might be available from the individual schools. Some schools have more financial aid funding available and may be able to offer you a more substantial award. This may be an important factor in your decision about which school you want to attend.</p>
