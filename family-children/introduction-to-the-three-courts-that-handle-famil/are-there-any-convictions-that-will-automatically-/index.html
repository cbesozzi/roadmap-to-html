          <h3><a id="_Toc317247500"></a><a id="_Toc448153600"></a>Are there any convictions that will automatically ban me from reconnecting with my child or grandchild in family court?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes. As stated on PG. 894 your criminal record can be one of many factors a family court judge will consider in deciding what is in the “best interest of the child.”</p>
          <p class="text">For some conviction offenses, the law will <em>automatically ban you</em> from reconnecting with a child or grandchild. For other convictions and criminal history that <em>do not completely prevent you</em> from having custody or visitation with your child, a family court judge will look at this history as one factor of many in deciding what custody and/or visitation plan is in the “best interest of the child.” For example, if you have past convictions for child abuse, first-degree murder of the child’s other parent, or being a 290-sex offender registrant where the victim was a minor, a judge is unlikely to grant full custody or unsupervised visitation. See the chart below for detail (PG. 921).</p>
