  <h2><a href="/housing/evictions/what-could-happen-if-i-do-not-pay-my-rent-or-do-no/index.html">What could happen if I do not pay my rent or do not move within the 3 days?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What could happen if I do not pay my rent or do not move within the 3 days?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The landlord must go to court to evict you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The 3-Day notice is only the first step in the eviction process. The landlord must go to court and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see PG. 454.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO PERFORM COVENANT(S) OR QUIT
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes this kind of notice is called “3-Day Notice to Perform or Quit.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The landlord will give you this notice if s/he believes that you did something OR failed to do something that violated your lease or rental agreement. Some examples include, if you did not pick up trash around your place, if you took in pets when they are not allowed, or if you left a junk car in the parking lot. This notice must be IN WRITING.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After you get this notice, you have 3 days to fix the problem or move out.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To figure out when the last day to fix the problem or move out is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to correct the problem. If you do not fix the problem and if you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, after the three days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The landlord must file court papers and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see PG. 454.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of breaking the lease, you should write to your landlord explaining your side of the story. Make sure to date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. Make a copy of it to keep for your records.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you already have broken the lease or rental agreement but now you agree to obey it, you should write a letter to the landlord. Tell him or her that you have done what the notice requested and that you will obey the lease agreement from now on. Sign and date the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. Keep a copy for your records.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO QUIT
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This kind of notice orders you to move because you have done something that the landlord believes cannot be corrected. This is the most serious notice your landlord can give you. For example, you may get this kind of notice if you have done illegal things (such as using or dealing drugs) on the property. This notice does not give you the chance to correct what was done. This notice means your landlord just wants you to move out. This notice must be in writing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of doing something that you did not do, you should write to your landlord immediately and state that you did not do what you are accused of doing. Make sure you date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. You must also keep a copy of the letter for your records.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, as with other eviction notices, after the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply kick you out without a court order.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SERVICE OF THE 3-DAY NOTICE
  </p>
  
  <p>
     The law states that you must be given a 3-Day Notice in writing. The courts are not always strict about how the landlord gives the 3-Day Notice to you. However, the law says that the landlord must give the notice to in one of the following ways:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Personal Service — by handing you a copy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Substituted Service — if you are not home or at your usual workplace, a copy can be left at either place with a person who is old enough to understand the importance of the 3-Day Notice. A copy of the notice must also be mailed to you. Keep the envelope in which the notice was mailed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Nail and Mail” — if the landlord cannot do either of the above, a copy of the 3-Day Notice can be posted on your property in a place that you will find it. A copy of the notice must also be mailed to you.
