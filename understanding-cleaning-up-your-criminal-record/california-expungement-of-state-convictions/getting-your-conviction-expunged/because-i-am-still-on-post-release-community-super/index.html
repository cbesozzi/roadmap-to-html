          <p class="text">Yes. Under the Realignment law, the maximum amount of time that you can be on Post-Release Community Supervision is 3 years (not including any time that your PRCS was revoked or suspended).<sup><a href="#footnote-2994" id="footnote-ref-2994">[2960]</a></sup> However, you can be released early in 2 situations: </p>
          <ol class="text"><strong>Six months/No violations</strong>‚ÄîIf you have been on PRCS for 6 straight months with no violations, you may ask for an early release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2995" id="footnote-ref-2995">[2961]</a></sup> The process for requesting early release from PRCS is very similar to the process for requesting early release from regular probation (see APPENDIX¬†P, on PG.¬†1235):<sup><a href="#footnote-2996" id="footnote-ref-2996">[2962]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">You will need to write a <em>motion</em> requesting an early release from PRCS, and <em>file</em> it in court in the county where you are on PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-2997" id="footnote-ref-2997">[2963]</a></sup> The main difference when you request an early release from PRCS is that the court will ask your probation officer for a probation report and use it to decide whether or not to release you early.<sup><a href="#footnote-2998" id="footnote-ref-2998">[2964]</a></sup> If you have been on PRCS for less than one year, it is entirely up to the judge whether or not to release you early, based on your motion and on what is in your probation report.<sup><a href="#footnote-2999" id="footnote-ref-2999">[2965]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text"><strong>One year/No violations</strong>‚ÄîIf you have been on PRCS continuously for 1 year with no violations, you will <em>automatically</em> be discharged early, within 30 days after your 1-year anniversary.<sup><a href="#footnote-3000" id="footnote-ref-3000">[2966]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">the probation department does NOT discharge you automatically after If this time, you may need to file a motion in court asking the judge to discharge you. Ask a lawyer for help if you are in this situation. For a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help, see PG.¬†1286.</ol>
          <h4 class="textbox">A Note About Early Release From Probation &amp; Getting a Conviction Expunged in Court at The Same Time:</h4>
          <p class="text">Generally, <em>early release</em> from probation and <em>expungement </em>of the underlying conviction go hand in hand. They usually happen at the <em>same court appearance</em>, one right after the other. You will file <em>both</em> a <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em> (see APPENDIX¬†P, on PG.¬†1235) and a <em>Petition for Dismissal (</em>see APPENDIX¬†K, on PG.¬†1226). If the judge grants your <em>Early Release from Probation</em> motion, he or she will probably grant your <em>Dismissal Petition</em> also (as long as you meet all the other expungement requirements), so you could be <em>off probation</em> AND have your conviction <em>expunged</em> by the end of the day! </p>
