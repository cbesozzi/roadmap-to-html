        <h1>Does the job or career you are interested in have restrictions against people with criminal records?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153747"></a>Does the job or career you are interested in have restrictions against people with criminal records?</h3>
        <p class="text">Some jobs or career fields are prohibited or have limited opportunities for people with certain criminal convictions—called legal job restrictions. Additionally, many jobs in California require you to get a professional/ occupational license in order to work in this job, and many licensing boards have restrictions about issuing licenses to people with certain convictions (see next question for more information). So even though this information can be difficult and frustrating to learn, it will help you to design the best path for yourself—one that you are passionate about but that is also realistic. Given the laws and barriers in place regarding certain professions and license, this information may be useful to consider when making decisions regarding your educational path. For more information about legal and professional/occupational licensing restrictions, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, PG. 748.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153748"></a>What are the jobs that have legal restrictions for people with criminal records?<em> </em></h3>
        <p class="text">Although this list is incomplete, below are some <em>examples</em> of jobs that have legal restrictions for people with certain criminal convictions. In general, these are jobs where employees have access to private or sensitive information (like financial records), vulnerable people (like children or the elderly), or high-security places (such as airports) where there is a greater risk of harm to the public. </p>
