          <p class="text">To transfer districts, you need to discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of both your probation officer from the current district AND a probation officer from the new district. You can only transfer if it doesn’t go against the instructions from the U.S. Parole Commission.<sup><a href="#footnote-875" id="footnote-ref-875">[849]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">Go to PG. 278 to learn how to transfer states. An Interstate Compact governs all transfers between states, and applies to all types of supervision (state parole, county probation and other county-level forms of supervision, federal probation, supervised release, and federal parole).</p>
