          <h3><a id="_Toc448153388"></a>What documents do I need before I apply for any job?</h3>
          <p class="text">You should get: (1) official ID and (2) copies of your criminal records to review.</p>
          <div class="textstrongemphasis">OFFICIAL FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION:</div>
          <p class="text">Before you apply for any job, you should begin the process of applying for basic government-issued IDs. (<em>To learn more about different forms of official ID, see the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21.) </em>In most cases, you will need at least:</p>
          <ol class="text">A government-issued ID (such as a driver license / state ID, PG. 48, or passport, PG. 70), AND</ol>
          <ol class="text">EITHER your Social Security Number (SSN) (PG. 41) OR your Birth Certificate (PG. 32).</ol>
          <p class="text">You will need these ID documents when you apply for a job and complete the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9, which all employees in the United States must fill out. Form I-9 proves you are legally allowed to work in the country. Your employer should give you this form to fill out. See Appendix A, PG. 767, for more information about Form I-9.</p>
          <p class="text">Please note that the employer cannot keep your documents, but may make a photocopy of them for your employment file.<sup><a href="#footnote-1762" id="footnote-ref-1762">[1732]</a></sup></p>
          <div class="textstrongemphasis">COPIES OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS:</div>
          <p class="text">You should get copies of your criminal records so that you know what employers are likely to find out if/when they run a background check. This will help you prepare to answer questions about your history and to address any concerns an employer may have. It’s also good to get a copy of your <em>official</em> criminal record (called a “RAP Sheet”) just for you, to make sure that all the information is accurate, and to correct errors if you find them. See UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132, for information about how to get a copy of your RAP sheet. See PG. 706, below, to learn more about background checks and what information your employer can see.<sup><a href="#footnote-1763" id="footnote-ref-1763">[1733]</a></sup></p>
