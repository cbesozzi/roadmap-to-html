  <p>
    Can I legally change my name?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe. The California Courts website gives step-by-step instructions for changing your name online: http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-namechange.htm. The website has specific information for people who are divorcing, getting married, changing their legal gender, and other requests. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A judge must approve legal name changes. In all cases, you will need to prove that your name change doesn’t pose any security risk to the community.[4] A judge may find that you cannot legally change your name if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The judge finds that you are changing your name to commit fraud; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The judge finds that you are changing your name to hide from the police or law enforcement or for some other illegal reason; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are currently on probation or parole — UNLESS your probation or parole officer is aware of your legal name change AND gives you written approval; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are incarcerated in prison.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are incarcerated in a California state prison, you need permission from the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to change your name. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are incarcerated in federal prison, you need permission from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to change your name.[5]
