                <p class="description">Being under some type of supervision is usually required for you to be released from prison or jail into community. In the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, you will learn that in California, there are many types of supervision—state parole, county probation, Mandatory Supervision, PRCS, federal probation &amp; federal parole. This chapter will help you understand what it means to be under supervision, what special rules you have to follow, and all of the rights you have as a person in reentry.</p>
                <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152774"></a>What is community supervision?</h3>
                <p class="text">After your release from prison or jail OR instead of incarceration, you will often be required to be under some sort of correctional supervision in the community, with special rules that apply to you—like where you can live and work, who you can contact, and people or places that you have to regularly report to. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152775"></a>Why is it important to know what type of supervision I am on, and the rules of that supervision department?</h3>
                <p class="text">It is important to know what kind of supervision you are on and the rules of that supervision department because it impacts every other part of your life—where you can travel, where and how often you have to report to a supervising officer, the steps you should take if you are having a problem with the rules (“conditions”) of your supervision, the amount of time you’ll be under supervision in the community, the types of record-cleaning and record-improving remedies that will be available to you, the type of contact you may be able to have with certain people or family members, your ability to vote and serve on a jury, and MORE. We hope that this Chapter helps to explain to you the rights and responsibilities you have under your specific type of supervision—state parole; county probation, mandatory supervision, or PRCS; OR federal probation, supervised release, or federal parole.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152776"></a>What are the main types of supervision in California?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are 4 main categories of supervision in California. They are:<span class="emphasisheavy">STATE PAROLE: </span>In California, parole is a condition of release for most people coming out of prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-308" id="footnote-ref-308">[308]</a></sup> It only applies in felony cases when a person is sentenced to state prison. It also only takes effect after release from prison.People sentenced to serve <em>determinate sentences</em>—such as an exact term of “seven years”—serve the specified amount of time in prison ordered by the judge. Once their sentence is over, they are released.People sentenced to serve indeterminate terms, such as “25 to life with the possibility of parole,” are released only after a Board of Parole Hearing (BPH) determines that they are ready to re-enter society.<sup><a href="#footnote-309" id="footnote-ref-309">[309]</a></sup> Most people released from California state prison are required to serve a period of parole after they are released. People on parole—called parolees—remain under the control of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s (CDCR) Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), are supervised by CDCR parole agents, and must meet certain requirements or “conditions” of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-310" id="footnote-ref-310">[310]</a></sup><span class="emphasisheavy">COUNTY PROBATION &amp; NEW FORMS OF COUNTY-LEVEL SUPERVISION:</span> Probation is a type of supervision that a judge orders at trial as <em>part of the original sentence</em>, either as an alternative to incarceration OR in addition to incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-311" id="footnote-ref-311">[311]</a></sup> California probation reduces or eliminates the time that a person must spend in custody in jail or prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-312" id="footnote-ref-312">[312]</a></sup> People on probation must report to their county probation office (for formal probation, more information is on PG. 198) or to local superior court (for informal probation, more information is on PG. 193), and must meet certain requirements or “conditions” of probation. Depending on the circumstances, either the court or a probation officer monitors the person’s compliance with his/her probation terms. Informal Probation, Formal Probation, Mandatory Supervision, and Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) are all types of community supervision that fall under the responsibility of California’s county probation departments. Unlike state parole offices, which are all operated by CDCR and DAPO, county probation departments have a lot more independence and differences between them. Here is a quick overview of the different types of county probation:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>INFORMAL PROBATION: Informal Probation is a type of supervision for some misdemeanor convictions in which you are supervised by the court, and not by a probation officer—also called summary probation or court probation. If you get probation imposed for a conviction that is a California misdemeanor, it is known as misdemeanor probation—also called “informal” probation or “summary” probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-313" id="footnote-ref-313">[313]</a></sup>FORMAL PROBATION: Formal Probation is a type of supervision for felony and some misdemeanor convictions in which you are supervised by a probation officer <sup><a href="#footnote-314" id="footnote-ref-314">[314]</a></sup>POST-RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION (PRCS): People released from a state prison after incarceration for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual crimes are placed under supervision by local, county probation officers instead of being supervised under state parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-315" id="footnote-ref-315">[315]</a></sup> This form of supervision is called Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS). PRCS can last for up to 3 years, but can end earlier if the person under supervision does not violate any conditions of his/her PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-316" id="footnote-ref-316">[316]</a></sup>MANDATORY SUPERVISION: Mandatory Supervision: In California, through a process called “split sentencing, a judge can split the time of a sentence between a jail term and a period of supervision by a county probation officer. This type of supervision is known as Mandatory Supervision.</strong></p>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">FEDERAL PROBATION</span>: People convicted of certain federal offenses may be sentenced to Federal Probation or Supervised Release. The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System oversees federal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-317" id="footnote-ref-317">[317]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>FEDERAL PROBATION: After you are convicted of a federal crime, federal probation is used as an alternative sentence <em>to prison time</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-318" id="footnote-ref-318">[318]</a></sup></sup> That means that federal “probation” is still considered a sentence in and of itself. For the most part, if you are placed on federal probation, you must report to your assigned probation office <em>and</em> comply with all the rules (“conditions”) of your federal probation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-319" id="footnote-ref-319">[319]</a></sup></sup> SUPERVISED RELEASE: Supervised Release is overseen by federal district courts with the help of federal probation officers.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-320" id="footnote-ref-320">[320]</a></sup></sup> The judge can sentence you to a term of Supervised Release <em>after your release from federal prison</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-321" id="footnote-ref-321">[321]</a></sup></sup> In other words, a term of Supervised Release does not replace any time you are sentenced to prison; rather, a judge orders Supervised Release in addition to any term in prison you may serve.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-322" id="footnote-ref-322">[322]</a></sup></sup> In some cases, the judge that sentences you is actually <em>required by law</em> to impose a term of Supervised Release in addition to a prison term.<sup><a href="#footnote-323" id="footnote-ref-323">[323]</a></sup> It’s common for a federal sentence to include a period of time in prison, followed by a period of time in the community on Supervised Release.</strong></p>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">FEDERAL PAROLE:</span> Federal Parole was eliminated in 1984. However, a small group of people—(1) those sentenced in federal court before November 1, 1987; (2) those who violate criminal laws in Washington, D.C. (the nation’s capital); (3) those convicted of crimes within the U.S. military’s criminal justice system; and (4) people convicted in certain foreign transfer treaty cases—may still be on federal parole, but are still supervised by federal probation officers.<sup><a href="#footnote-324" id="footnote-ref-324">[324]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152777"></a>What is the difference between the state &amp; federal systems?</h3>
                <p class="text">Depending on whether you were convicted of a federal or state crime, it will affect not only <em>where</em> you are incarcerated (federal prison, state prison, or county jail), but also <em>what type of supervision</em> you will be on after your release.</p>
                <p class="widetableintroitalcaps">Below is a chart that briefly shows these differences between the state &amp; federal systems.</p>

                <p class="text">You may not know what type of supervision you are currently on, and in certain situations you could be on more than one type, or on different types back-to-back. If you don’t know, and <em>you are still incarcerated</em>, you should ask a correctional counselor in your institution. If you don’t know, and <em>you are out</em>, you should ask the case manager or supervising officer you report to.<em> </em></p>
                <p>Once you know what type of supervision you are on, you can skip to the section in this chapter that addresses questions and issues related to your specific type of supervision.</p>

                <h4 class="textbox">A Note About the Terms Used in the Parole &amp; Probation Chapter:</h4>
                <p>We want to mention that this Chapter uses a lot of the terminology and language that the California Department of Corrections (CDCR) and other correctional agencies and departments use to describe people returning to the community from prison and jail. We don’t agree with many of the ways that people with criminal records are described, but at times we use this language to make this material understandable to our readers. To learn about the movement to use humanizing language when talking about currently or formerly incarcerated people: please visit the following Root &amp; Rebound blog post that summarized a letter from formerly incarcerated leaders discussing the power of language: <a href="https://rootrebound.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/discourse-can-de-humanize-open-letter-on-language-from-cnus/">https://rootrebound.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/discourse-can-de-humanize-open-letter-on-language-from-cnus/</a><strong>.</strong></p>

                <p class="textbox">Before you start reading this chapter, it would be good for you to get a sense of some of the key terms we use. Although they are explained in the chapter, we want to include them here for you to get familiar with:</p>
                <ul class="textbox"><strong>Conditions</strong>—Written rules that you have to follow while on parole or probation<strong>Special Conditions</strong>—Extra rules that apply to you in addition to the basic rules that apply to all people under supervision<strong>Commitment Offense</strong>—The offense for which you went to prison or jail<strong>Discharge</strong>—The date you are released from supervision <strong>Parole Period</strong>—The period of time you have to spend on parole<strong>Residence</strong>—The address where you live<strong>Board of Parole Hearings (BPH)</strong>—A group of 12 commissioners, chosen by the California governor, who sit on a board and conduct hearings where they decide if a person is suitable to get released from prison on to parole.<strong>CDCR</strong>—CDCR is the abbreviation for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which is a state government agency runs the criminal justice system in California<strong>California Penal Code</strong>—The legal basis for all criminal laws in California. </ul>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152782"></a>What is California state parole?</h3>
                <p class="text">In California, parole is a condition of release for a person coming out of prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-325" id="footnote-ref-325">[325]</a></sup></sup> It will only apply to people convicted of a state felony and sentenced to state prison. State parole only takes effect after you are released from prison.</p>
                <p>People on parole—sometimes called parolees—remain under the control of CDCR. Within CDCR, parolees are more specifically under the control of the Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), a division of CDCR. As a parolee, you are supervised by CDCR parole agents, and must satisfy certain rules or “conditions” of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-326" id="footnote-ref-326">[326]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152783"></a>I am currently incarcerated in California state prison, and preparing for release. Will I be required to serve a parole term after I get released from prison?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes, if you committed a certain type of offense, or are in a specific situation. If you are currently incarcerated in California state prison, you must serve a parole term after release from prison if any of the following apply:</p>
                <ol class="text">Your current prison term is for a <em>serious felony</em> as defined in Cal. Penal Code § 1192.7(c);Your current prison term is for a <em>violent felony</em> as defined in Cal. Penal Code § 667.5(c);You were sentenced as a <em>“three-striker”</em> under Cal. Penal Code §§ 667(b)-(i) or 1170.12(c)(2); You are classified by CDCR as a <em>“High-Risk Sex Offender,” </em>regardless of your commitment offense; OR You are found to be a <em>“Mentally Disordered Offender” (MDO)</em> under Cal. Penal Code § 2962.2.</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you don't fall into any of these categories, then you are likely on a new form of supervision called Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS). Go to PG. 201 to learn more about PRCS. If you think you will be on state parole, not PRCS, see the earlier section on state parole, on PG. 146.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152784"></a>When is the Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) vs. Parole assessment done?</h3>
                <p class="text">Before you are released from prison, a correctional counselor will screen your case and decide whether to refer you to state parole or PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-327" id="footnote-ref-327">[327]</a></sup> The correctional officer should start this screening process at least 180 days prior to your calculated release date.<sup><a href="#footnote-328" id="footnote-ref-328">[328]</a></sup> The CDCR Form 611, “Release Program Study,” (see Appendix S, PG. 316) is used to determine if you will be eligible for PRCS after release.<sup><a href="#footnote-329" id="footnote-ref-329">[329]</a></sup></p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448152785"></a>After Release: What to Expect in Your First Days Out on State Parole</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152786"></a>What are some my responsibilities when I first get out of state prison under state parole supervision?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are several responsibilities to be aware when you first get out of state prison and are living in the community under the supervision of parole:</p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack">FIRST, YOU SHOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH YOUR PAROLE OFFICER &amp; VISIT THAT PAROLE OFFICE.</h5>
                <p class="text">CDCR makes it clear that “it is up to you to get yourself to your parole office” upon release, so do your best to make contact with your parole officer right away, and visit the office as soon as you can, if you don’t have a set appointment time.<sup><a href="#footnote-330" id="footnote-ref-330">[330]</a></sup>You should call your parole officer when you first get out. The agent’s name, address, and telephone number should be on CDCR Form 611, “<a id="PP_FirstDays_RPSinformation"></a><a id="PP_StateParole_FirstDays_RPSinformation"></a>Release Program Study” (RPS) (see example of RPS in Appendix S, PG. 316), which you should have received a copy of at least 45 days before your release date (or if less than 45 days remain because your legal status changed in prison, then as soon as possible before your release to parole).<sup><a href="#footnote-331" id="footnote-ref-331">[331]</a></sup> If you cannot get a hold of your parole agent, or do not know who that person is, try going to the closest parole office you can find and ask them for help. The parole office can call your parole agent and let him or her know you are coming and when you will be there. For a list of California state parole office’s main phone numbers, visit: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/</a>. If you were given a date, time, and place to report to your parole officer (see your Form 611, Release Program Study (RPS)), you should report to him or her at that time in that location.<sup><a href="#footnote-332" id="footnote-ref-332">[332]</a></sup> Generally, it is recommended that if you get out on a weekday and have the time or ability to go to the office that day, you should. If you get out on a weekend or national holiday when the parole office is closed, it is recommended that you go to your parole office the very next day it is open. If you get stuck out of town, get lost, or cannot get to where you have to go, call your parole agent or the Officer of the Day collect. Call the Parole Headquarters for your Region (or if you don’t know which region, call the California Region I Headquarters) and ask for the Officer of the Day: Northern Region Headquarters (Tel. 916-255-2758); Southern Region Parole Headquarters (Tel. 909-468-2300).<sup><a href="#footnote-333" id="footnote-ref-333">[333]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack">TELL YOUR PAROLE AGENT OF CRIMES AGAINST YOU AFTER RELEASE, IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS.</h5>
                <p class="text">If anyone commits a crime against you before you make contact with your parole officer, tell your parole agent what happened.<sup><a href="#footnote-334" id="footnote-ref-334">[334]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack">TELL YOUR PAROLE AGENT IF YOU ARE STOPPED BY THE POLICE.</h5>
                <p class="text">If you get stopped by the police for any reason, tell your parole agent about it.<sup><a href="#footnote-335" id="footnote-ref-335">[335]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack">REGISTER WITH THE LOCAL POLICE OR SHERIFF, IF NECESSARY.</h5>
                <p class="text">Before you get out of prison, you should be told if you have to register with the local police or sheriff. Not all people on parole will have to do this, but if you went to prison for a sex, drug, gang, or arson case, it may be required.<sup><a href="#footnote-336" id="footnote-ref-336">[336]</a></sup> If you are told it is a necessary part of your parole conditions, register with the Police or Sherriff as soon as possible. The correctional counselor at the prison must notify you of your registration requirement before you are released from custody—and will do so by checking a box on CDCR Form 611, “Release Program Study” (RPS), indicating your registration requirements (see example of this form in Appendix S, PG. 316), which must be given to you at least 45 days before your expected release date.<sup><a href="#footnote-337" id="footnote-ref-337">[337]</a></sup> You will then have to sign a form that tells you when and how you must register (see the chart on the next page to know which additional form you’ll be given).<sup><a href="#footnote-338" id="footnote-ref-338">[338]</a></sup> If you have questions, talk with your correctional counselor in the prison, or with your parole agent once you are out.<sup><a href="#footnote-339" id="footnote-ref-339">[339]</a></sup> <em>Please refer to the chart on the next page for a summary of these registration requirements.</em></p>

                <p class="text">You will most likely be paroled from prison to the county where you last lived (called your “last legal residence”).<sup><a href="#footnote-342" id="footnote-ref-342">[342]</a></sup>However, CDCR will require you to parole to a <em>different county</em> if it would be “in the best interests of the public.”<sup><a href="#footnote-343" id="footnote-ref-343">[343]</a></sup> This means that if you were convicted of <em>certain violent felonies</em> (including murder, voluntary manslaughter, mayhem, rape, sodomy by force, oral copulation, lewd acts on a child under 14, any felony punishable by death), or a crime involving <em>stalking</em> or a <em>great bodily injury</em> enhancement, you will not be paroled to a county where you would be within 35 miles of the residence of a <em>victim</em> or <em>witness</em> if: (1) the victim or witness has requested additional distance, and/or (2) the BPH or CDCR finds that there is a need to protect the victim or witness.<sup><a href="#footnote-344" id="footnote-ref-344">[344]</a></sup> If the BPH or CDCR decides to send you to another county for parole, the agency making the decision must state their reasons for doing so in writing.<sup><a href="#footnote-345" id="footnote-ref-345">[345]</a></sup></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152788"></a>Is there any form of financial assistance from parole when I first get out?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes, but it is <em>very limited </em>and for a very small amount. You are entitled to the money in your trust account and gate money. You may be able to get other emergency funds by requesting them through your parole agent. Below we explain the types of financial assistance you can ask for on your first days out in more detail:</p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack">TRUST ACCOUNTS: </h5>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “INTEREST”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Interest is a small percentage amount of your money being held that gets added to your account periodically for the prison having the ability to hold your money.</p>
                <p class="text">Money that you brought to, earned, or received in prison is kept in an interest-bearing trust account. The “interest” is paid to the trust account on a monthly basis, minus operational expenses incurred. Any money in your prison trust account, including any interest you earned, must be given to you at your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-346" id="footnote-ref-346">[346]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">I WAS IN CDCR’s CUSTODY FOR LESS THAN 6 MONTHS DUE TO A PAROLE VIOLATION. DO I GET GATE MONEY WHEN I AM RELEASED?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If you were returned to the custody of prison or jail on a parole violation—but were there for less than 6 months—you will receive $1.10 per day that you are held, up to a maximum of $200. (<em>See</em> 15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3075.2(d)(4).)</p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack"><a id="PP_StateParole_GateMoney"></a>GATE MONEY (a.k.a. “RELEASE ALLOWANCE”):</h5>
                <h4>&gt; $200 GATE MONEY:</h4>
                <p class="text">If you are leaving state prison and you are (1) paroled, (2) placed on post-release community supervision (PRCS), or (3) discharged from a CDCR institution or reentry facility, you are entitled to $200 in state funds upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-347" id="footnote-ref-347">[347]</a></sup> Even though your parole agent is responsible for giving you these funds, the agent is not required to give you the entire amount immediately. Instead, your parole agent may distribute the $200 in separate, smaller amounts over a period of 60 days following your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-348" id="footnote-ref-348">[348]</a></sup> By the end of those 60 days, you should have received the entire $200. If you need to purchase clothes or a bus ticket at the time of your release, you must pay for it; CDCR does not provide extra gate money for clothing or transportation, but will deduct it from your $200 gate money if you ask them to front this cost.<sup><a href="#footnote-349" id="footnote-ref-349">[349]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You also have the right to the $200 gate money in the following cases:</p>
                <ul class="importantbox">If you were sent to a local jail for civil commitment proceedings or evaluation as a “sexually violent predator” (SVP).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-350" id="footnote-ref-350">[350]</a></sup></strong>If you are a “lifer parolee” who returned to prison on a parole violation, when you are re-released to parole.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-351" id="footnote-ref-351">[351]</a></sup></strong>If you served 6 straight months or more on a sentence OR on a return-to-custody for a parole violation (these 6 months could be time spent in jail or in prison).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-352" id="footnote-ref-352">[352]</a></sup></strong><em>If you do not receive your gate money in one of these situations—a common occurrence—you should file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal. Ask your jail or parole officer for the proper forms.</em></ul>
                <h4>&gt; YOU WILL GET ONLY $100 GATE MONEY IF YOU ALREADY RECEIVED A $100 ADVANCE</h4>
                <p class="text">If you are released from prison into a Community Correctional Reentry Facility<sup><a href="#footnote-353" id="footnote-ref-353">[353]</a></sup> or Alternative Custody Program (ACP),<sup><a href="#footnote-354" id="footnote-ref-354">[354]</a></sup> you may be given an advance of up to $100 of your gate money at that time.<sup><a href="#footnote-355" id="footnote-ref-355">[355]</a></sup> Once you are released from the reentry facility or ACP, you may only receive what is left of the $200 not yet given to you—for most, this will be $100 remaining.<sup><a href="#footnote-356" id="footnote-ref-356">[356]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4>&gt; YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE YOUR GATE MONEY IF YOU ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON INTO THE CUSTODY OF ANOTHER AGENCY THAT IS DETAINING YOU</h4>
                <p class="text">If you are released from prison into the custody of another state, local law enforcement, or the federal government (meaning, you are released from state prison and into the custody of a federal prison or another jail/prison because you have been convicted or face charges in another jurisdiction), you will not get any gate money until you are released from that custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-357" id="footnote-ref-357">[357]</a></sup> Similarly, if you are released from prison into the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and are waiting a deportation hearing date, you will not get gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-358" id="footnote-ref-358">[358]</a></sup></p>
                <h4>&gt; YOU WILL FORFEIT (GIVE UP) YOUR RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION</h4>
                <p class="text">If you abscond from parole (meaning you flee, go missing, or do not report to your parole agent as required) before receiving all of your gate money, you give up your right to the gate money. This means if you fail to report or to let your parole agent know of your whereabouts, you lose your right to the $200 gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-359" id="footnote-ref-359">[359]</a></sup> If you abscond from parole, you also risk: 1) getting your parole revoked and going back to prison; 2) being held on parole for a longer time period than originally required; 3) being forced to wear a GPS tracking advice by parole (see PG. 168). </p>
                <h4>&gt; YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO GATE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATION</h4>
                <p class="text">If you are released after being placed in jail for parole revocation proceedings, you do not receive gate money.<sup><a href="#footnote-360" id="footnote-ref-360">[360]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question">What should I do if I don’t get my gate money?</h5>
                <p class="text">Your parole officer should provide you your gate money at your release. If, however, your officer does not have the money or does not know where to send it, you should file an administrative appeal (CDCR Form 602 and CDCR Form 22) and start the grievance process. We recommend keeping copies and dates of any appeals or grievance forms you submit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-361" id="footnote-ref-361">[361]</a></sup></sup> If you are in special proceedings—like MDO (Mentally Disordered Offender) or SVP (Sexually Violent Predator) hearings—your public defender/defense attorney <em>may</em> be able to help you with this process, as getting the gate money is more complicated. To learn how to file an administrative appeal on a CDCR Form 602, see PG. 175.</p>
                <h5 class="numberboldblack">EMERGENCY FUNDS </h5>
                <p class="text">There are 2 very limited types of emergency funds<sup><a href="#footnote-362" id="footnote-ref-362">[362]</a></sup> that you can request through your parole agent: (1) Cash Assistance Loans (also called “financial assistance funds”)<sup><a href="#footnote-363" id="footnote-ref-363">[363]</a></sup> and (2) Funds for Services (also called “Bank Drafts”).<sup><a href="#footnote-364" id="footnote-ref-364">[364]</a></sup> Unfortunately, in these current tight budget times, these funds are extremely limited.These funds are <em>discretionary</em>. This means that your parole agent and his or her supervisor decide whether to give you a “cash assistance loan” or funds for services. Their decision will depend on the following factors:</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT STOPS THE CLOCK FOR MY LENGTH OF TIME ON PAROLE?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The clock for your parole period is paused if:(1) YOU GO MISSING: Any time during that you “abscond” from parole (go missing or fail to report to your parole agent), and any time you are not available for parole supervision, this “stops the clock” and does not count toward the parole period. (2) YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR (SVP) PROCEEDINGS: The parole term is “tolled” (paused) until the SVP proceedings are dismissed or you are discharged from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH).(3) YOU ARE SENT TO COUNTY JAIL (NOT PRISON) FOR A NEW FELONY CONVICTION. If you are sentenced to a county jail term for a new felony conviction, you will stay on parole while serving your jail sentence, but the clock will pause on your parole term. If the jail sentence ends before your controlling discharge date (CDD) (see chart on PG. 154), you must report to your parole officer upon release and finish serving your original parole term. But if your are sentenced for a new felony conviction, your parole will just be forgotten about—it isn’t paused, but it no longer matters. </p>
                <ol class="text">Whether there is money available;<sup><a href="#footnote-365" id="footnote-ref-365">[365]</a></sup>The circumstances, including your history and needs;<sup><a href="#footnote-366" id="footnote-ref-366">[366]</a></sup> ANDWhether you are a citizen (as there are legal limits on the financial assistance that CA State Parole can provide to certain parolees who are <em>not</em> U.S. citizens).<sup><a href="#footnote-367" id="footnote-ref-367">[367]</a></sup></ol>
                <p><strong>(1) FIRST TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Cash Assistance Loans </strong></p>
                <p>Cash Assistance Loans (a.k.a. “Financial Assistance Funds”) are loans that you may request from your parole agent. CDCR expects you to pay back these loans as soon as possible (for example, once employment or other financial circumstances allow you to do so). These loans are only granted when there is a critical need and assistance is not available from any other source.<sup><a href="#footnote-368" id="footnote-ref-368">[368]</a></sup> The loans are usually for amounts under $50. The parole agent’s supervisor must approve any loan over $50 or any series of loans totaling more than $150 in a 30-day period.<sup><a href="#footnote-369" id="footnote-ref-369">[369]</a></sup></p>
                <p><strong>(2) SECOND TYPE OF EMERGENCY FUND: Funds for Services:</strong></p>
                <p>Your parole agent is also authorized to distribute Funds for Services (a.k.a. “Bank Drafts”), including for housing, food, and clothing. Your parole agent may authorize a loan of up to $500 to you for over-the-counter purchases. The check may be written either directly to you or to the vendor who is selling the item that you are purchasing. Once again, the loans are granted on an emergency basis, and you must pay the money back as soon as you able to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-370" id="footnote-ref-370">[370]</a></sup></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152790"></a>Where will I see the length of my parole? And who calculates it?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your parole date will be listed on your CDCR Form 1515,<em> </em>“Notice and Conditions of Parole” (see example <strong>i</strong>n<strong> </strong>Appendix G<strong>, </strong>PG. 285). Parole will be responsible for calculating these dates based on state law, and your parole agent must tell you what they are.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152791"></a>If I am on state parole, what law sets the length of my parole? </h3>
                <p class="text">If you are on state parole, the length of your parole period is set by state law<sup><a href="#footnote-371" id="footnote-ref-371">[371]</a></sup> and is based on your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you are or were incarcerated for), and <em>when the commitment offense occurred</em>. The state law that is applied to determine your base parole period and maximum parole period is the law that was in existence <em>at the time of the commitment offense</em> (NOT the date you were sentenced on and NOT the date you were released onto parole).<sup><a href="#footnote-372" id="footnote-ref-372">[372]</a></sup>In most cases, there is a minimum parole period that can be increased up to a maximum parole period if you commit parole violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-373" id="footnote-ref-373">[373]</a></sup> Because state laws set the minimum &amp; maximum parole term lengths, the date that a person actually gets off parole will be determined by a number of factors. See PG. 154 for more information. There are actually 3 discharge dates—a Controlling Discharge Date, Maximum Discharge Date, and Presumptive Discharge Date— that together determine when you actually get off parole, and a number of factors that interact with those 3 dates to determine when you’re eligible to get off parole earlier or later than originally expected. See the chart on PG. 154 below for a detailed description of these three dates and how they interact with each other.You can find the parole term lengths in California Penal Code § 3000(b) (for set-length parole terms) and § 3000.1 (for life-long parole terms)—we have included copies of the current versions of these laws in Appendix F, PG. 281, for your reference. (The California Penal Code is a chapter of laws that apply to crimes, parole, and other criminal justice system-related laws in California). To look up the discharge dates that apply to you, see Appendix C, PG. 277 of this Chapter.</p>

                <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
                <p class="textbox">In addition to these very important 3 dates, you can ask for your parole agent to recommend that you get off parole even earlier than your Presumptive Discharge Date (PDD), but this is very hard to do successfully. That’s because for your parole agent to recommend you get off even earlier, everyone has to agree—the parole agent has to support you; the agent’s supervisor has to agree; the Regional Administrator for your parole region must approve your request; and finally, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH), must approve your early release from parole.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152792"></a>What can I do if I think that the length of my parole is miscalculated?</h3>
                <p class="text">If you believe your parole length has been miscalculated, which does happen time to time, you can and should APPEAL (challenge) your parole term length with CDCR. You have to exhaust the appeals process before you can go to court. First, understand the timelines for filing an appeal (see box below). Then, follow the three steps, starting on PG. 155, to file your appeal.<strong> </strong></p>

                <ol class="text">SUBMIT FORM 22: To challenge the length of your parole (your CDD, MDD, or PDD), you will need to file a CDCR Form 22, “Request for Interview, Item or Service” with your parole agent.<sup><a href="#footnote-387" id="footnote-ref-387">[387]</a></sup> You can get this Form 22 from any parole field office (see Appendix I, PG. 292 for an example, but always ask for the most current version of any CDCR form).<sup><a href="#footnote-388" id="footnote-ref-388">[388]</a></sup> If you don’t already know it, you can find your local parole office’s address online at: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/</a>.

                <h4 class="textbox">REAL-LIFE PRACTICE TIP<br/>for 602 appeals</h4>
                <p class="textbox">In real-life practice, the formal written response to a 602 appeal will often not get back to the parolee who filed it. Sometimes the formal response is sent to a parole agent, who doesn’t hand it over to the parolee. If you are not physically sent or handed a WRITTEN formal response to your Form 602 appeal (which is different and separate than the written response from your parole agent to a Form 22 request), then this is NOT considered an answer or formal response under law—because it was never given/sent to you. After 30 working days are up, you can try calling your parole agent to find out where the formal response to your 602 is and request a copy be sent to you immediately, but if you are still not given anything after an unreasonable amount of time has passed, then you have exhausted (completed) the administrative appeals process and can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus (or file a second 602 appeal about the delay). See PG. 155 for detailed information about what to do if you don’t hear back within the legal time limits. Please note: A short delay is unlikely to be seen as “exhausting” the administrative appeals process—for example, a few days or a week late, or a mistake that was immediately fixed by handing you a copy when you asked—but if a month or more has passed, this looks more like an unreasonable delay and is likely to be considered exhaustion, allowing you to take the case to state court.</p>
                <h4 class="textbox">IMPORT<a id="responsetimelimit602"></a>ANT! WHAT CAN I DO IF CDCR/ PAROLE IS BREAKING THE LEGAL TIME LIMITS FOR RESPONDING TO MY 602 APPEAL?</h4>
                <div class="widetextboxtext">Unfortunately, it often happens that the CDCR Regional Appeals Coordinator office will not get back to you with a written formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law. Make sure to ask your parole agent and parole agent’s supervisor for the formal response to your 602 appeal at any of the three levels of review. If you still do not receive a written FORMAL RESPONSE in person or by mail after asking, you can:(1) File another 602 appeal, noting CDCR and Parole’s failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law.(2) File a state petition for a writ for habeas corpus in your local California State Superior Court– stating in the petition that because CDCR/Parole Department didn’t send you a formal response to your 602 appeal within the legal timelines, you’ve <em>exhausted</em> (completed) the only administrative appeals process available to you.(3) As a more informal action, and to help create a record of what is happening with your original 602, you should:</div>
                <p><em> Call the Regional Appeals Coordinator office requesting a formal response to your 602 be sent to you (and document these phone calls); AND</em></p>
                <p><em> Write and send a dated and signed letter to the Regional Appeals Coordinator where you sent the original 602, </em>noting CDCR and Parole’s failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law; <em>AND</em></p>
                <p><em> Similarly, write and send a dated and signed letter directly to the parole field office where you report, with attention to your parole agent and your parole agent’s supervisor, </em>noting CDCR and Parole’s failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law. In the letter you should include:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Your full name;Your CDC number under your name;A brief explanation of what issues your original 602 appeal was all about. Be sure to include the date that a formal response to your 602 appeal was due back to you; explain what level you are at in the 602 appeals process; and how much time has passed since your formal response was due back to you. You may also want to state any additional facts about the 602 appeal that you believe are relevant; ANDA copy of your original 602 appeal, if you have one, as evidence of your appeal. </strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>Why is this suggested?</em> </strong></p>
                <p>It is always better to have any problems that occur with the appeals process PUT INTO WRITING in a letter to the parole office, rather than just have verbal conversations about CDCR/Parole’s failure to respond with the legal timelines.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Where do you send your letter?</em> </strong></p>
                <p>(1) Send the first letter to your parole agent and the agent’s supervisor directly to your parole office where you report. Please visit the Division of Adult Parole Operation’s (DAPO) website at: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/</a> to find the address of your local parole office, if you don’t already know. Click on the Region where you are located for a full list of parole offices and addresses.</p>
                <p>(2) Send the second letter to the Regional Appeals Coordinator to the office address where you sent your original 602. As of now, it will be one of the following addresses, depending on which region of parole you are located in:</p>

                <p class="text">It depends—THIS IS USUALLY AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE, BUT IT IS AT THE DISCRETION OF PAROLE (WITH LIMITATIONS ON HOW THEY CAN MAKE THESE DECISIONS).Most people have the legal right to a presumption that they should get off of parole early—this is called the presumptive discharge date or PDD. Learn more about PDDs on PG. 154.Some people do not have a PDD under law BECAUSE OF THEIR commitment offense and when it occurred. See Appendix B, PG. 275, for a list of people who do not have PDDs under law. If you have a PDD, different time periods apply to you and they are set by state law. Your PDD depends on the underlying commitment offense, and when the commitment offense occurred. The PDD periods can be found in California Penal Code Sections 3000, 3000.1, 3001.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-396" id="footnote-ref-396">[396]</a></sup></sup> If you fit into more than one category, the longer period applies. See Appendix B, PG. 275, for a list of current PDD lengths.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152796"></a>What should happen when I reach my presumptive discharge date (PDD)?	</h3>
                <p class="text">If you are entitled to a PDD under law, then the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) <em>must</em> conduct a discharge review within <em>30 days</em> of your PDD.<sup><a href="#footnote-397" id="footnote-ref-397">[397]</a></sup> At this hearing, BPH must decide whether to keep you on parole or let you off early based on your parole agent’s report (submitted to the BPH on CDCR Form 1502)<sup><a href="#footnote-398" id="footnote-ref-398">[398]</a></sup> recommending for or against keeping you on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-399" id="footnote-ref-399">[399]</a></sup> Your parole agent will make his or her recommendation based on factors like: </p>

                <p class="answer">If your parole agent (or any other Parole or CDCR staff) makes a “mistake of fact” in the report to the BPH recommending whether or not you should be kept on parole, you can file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal challenging the mistake.<sup><a href="#footnote-403" id="footnote-ref-403">[403]</a></sup> See the steps for filing a 602 administrative appeal above on PG. 155. However, if you want to directly challenge the BPH decision (since there was no mistake in parole’s report, but you still think there wasn’t good cause to keep you on parole), you do not need to file a 602 appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-404" id="footnote-ref-404">[404]</a></sup> Please see PG. 161 below for more information about how to challenge a BPH action.</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS A “<a id="PP_StateParole_MistakeofFactDefinition"></a>MISTAKE OF FACT”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">A mistake of fact is an error caused by someone’s unawareness or ignorance of the circumstances of an event. </p>
                <p class="answer">If the reviewers of your 602 appeal find that there was a significant mistake in your parole agent’s report to the BPH and that mistake led to you being kept on parole past your PDD, they can change the recommendation and ask the BPH to reconsider its decision and discharge you from parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-405" id="footnote-ref-405">[405]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152797"></a>What are my rights at the presumptive discharge (PDD) review process?</h3>
                <p class="text">You have the right to see a written record of BPH’s decision of whether or not to keep you on parole. The BPH must make a written record of its decision, and must send a copy of that decision to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-406" id="footnote-ref-406">[406]</a></sup> If it is more than 30 days past your PDD and you did not receive written notice of the BPH’s decision, you may be entitled to IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE FROM PAROLE if the BPH failed to make a decision in your case. See PG. 162 below for more information.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152798"></a>Do I have a right to appear at the PDD review before the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH)?</h3>
                <p class="text">No. You do not have a right to personally appear at the BPH review.<sup><a href="#footnote-407" id="footnote-ref-407">[407]</a></sup> But, if CDCR staff makes a “mistake of fact”<sup><a href="#footnote-408" id="footnote-ref-408">[408]</a></sup> (see definition on PG. 160 in the report that goes to BPH, then you can file a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal asking for reconsideration, and clarifying the mistake that has been made.<sup><a href="#footnote-409" id="footnote-ref-409">[409]</a></sup> See the steps for filing a 602 appeal on PG. 155.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152799"></a>On what basis can the BPH decide to keep me on parole past my PDD instead of letting me off early?</h3>
                <p class="text">The BPH must have “good cause” to retain you (keep you) on parole past the presumptive discharge date (PDD), if you are entitled to one.<sup><a href="#footnote-410" id="footnote-ref-410">[410]</a></sup> The law sets out broad factors that give parole “good cause” to keep someone on parole—such as the original crime, in-prison behavior, and parole adjustment (defined on PG. 159 above).<sup><a href="#footnote-411" id="footnote-ref-411">[411]</a></sup> At this time, there are no published legal cases challenging a BPH finding of good cause for keeping someone on parole past his or her PDD, so unfortunately there isn’t much legal guidance. If you are in the situation of challenging a finding of good cause, it may help for you to show the BPH as much evidence as possible that you have adjusted well to parole, followed all of your parole conditions, been making efforts to pay off your restitution, complied with any registration requirements, and made significant efforts to turn your life around (both in prison and after release) since your commitment offense (including documentation of any employment, education or training, certificates for completing programs that helped you improve yourself or learn new skills, etc.).</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “GOOD CAUSE”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Good Cause is considered a good reason. It is defined by the CDCR as a finding by a preponderance of the evidence, more likely than not, that there is a factual basis and good reason for a decision. (15 Cal. Code Regs.§ 2000(b)(50)).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152800"></a>What happens if the BPH decides to continue my parole? </h3>
                <p class="text">If the BPH decides to continue your parole past the PDD, you will be reviewed for possible discharge each year until your maximum discharge date (MDD) is reached.<sup><a href="#footnote-412" id="footnote-ref-412">[412]</a></sup> At these annual review dates, you will remain on parole unless the BPH affirmatively acts to discharge you.<sup><a href="#footnote-413" id="footnote-ref-413">[413]</a></sup></p>
                <a id="_Toc448152801"></a>

                <h4 class="sidebox">REMINDER! you can challenge factual mistakes in your parole agent’s discharge review report</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If your parole agent or parole staff makes a FACTUAL MISTAKE in their recommendation to the BPH about whether or not you should be discharged early, you can challenge that mistake through a 602 appeal (see PG. 155 for that process). (15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3723).</p>
                <p class="text">Yes. Since you are challenging a decision by the BPH, and not by parole, you do NOT need to file a 602 appeal—you can challenge the BPH decision directly in state court.<sup><a href="#footnote-414" id="footnote-ref-414">[414]</a></sup>If there was not a mistake in parole’s report/recommendations to the BPH, but you still want to challenge the BPH’s decision to keep you on parole past your PDD because you don’t think they had a good reason to keep you on parole, then there is no administrative appeals process for challenging the BPH’s decision to retain you.<sup><a href="#footnote-415" id="footnote-ref-415">[415]</a></sup> Instead you will skip the appeals process and go straight to filing a state writ of habeas corpus in the state superior court where your parole is located to challenge the BPH’s decision to keep you on parole past the PDD. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152802"></a>What happens if I don’t get notice of a BPH decision within 30 days after my PDD?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends on <em>why</em> you didn’t get the notice. <em>There are two possibilities:</em> </p>
                <table><tr><td colspan="2"><p><strong>IT HAS BE</strong><a id="immediateparoledischarge"></a><strong>EN MORE THAN 30 DAYS SINCE MY PRESUMPTIVE DISCHARGE DATE (PDD), AND NO RESPONSE FROM BPH ABOUT WHETHER I AM DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE.

If it’s more than 30 days past your PDD, file a CDCR Form 22 with your parole agent and a CDCR Form 602 appeal with your parole region’s Appeals Coordinator to resolve this. For the steps on how to file these forms and start the appeals process, see the steps on PG. 176. </p></td><td><div class="textbox9">If your situation falls under this second possibility, the lack of notice does not invalidate BPH’s decision to retain you on parole (meaning you will still be on parole), but you may still appeal the decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-419" id="footnote-ref-419">[419]</a></sup></sup> If the BPH makes a decision to retain you on parole without giving you notice of that decision within the 30-day requirement under the law,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-420" id="footnote-ref-420">[420]</a></sup></sup> you can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus (see Appendix K, PG. 297 for steps on how to do this). The court may order BPH to provide you with a copy of the retention decision, which you can use to challenge BPH’s finding of good cause<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-421" id="footnote-ref-421">[421]</a></sup></sup> (through a writ of habeas corpus).

                <p class="sidebox">It is important to know and understand the conditions of your parole because if you violate any of the conditions of your parole, you may be arrested, incarcerated in a county jail, or returned to state prison, even if you are not convicted of a new crime. (<em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code § 3000.08(c).)<strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="text">The general conditions (rules) that apply to you and ALL people on state parole are the following:<sup><a href="#footnote-422" id="footnote-ref-422">[422]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">Unless other arrangements are approved in writing, you should report to your parole agent on the first working day following your release. You must inform your parole agent of your residence, employment, education, and/or training. You must report any change or anticipated change to your residence (the address where you live) before the change.You must inform your parole agent within 72 hours (3 days) of any change to your employment—including a change in job location, a change in your employer, or if you are terminated/fired/laid off from your job. You must comply with all of your parole agent’s instructions.You cannot travel more than 50 miles from your residence without your parole agent’s prior approval.You cannot leave your county of residence for more than 48 hours at a time.You cannot leave California without prior written approval of your parole agent.You cannot engage in any illegal activities (which includes any activities that would violate any state, federal, county, or municipal law). If you engage in illegal activity, even if you are not convicted of a crime, your parole may be revoked.If you are arrested for any felony or misdemeanor crime, you must inform your parole agent as soon as possible.You cannot own, use, possess, or have access to:Any type of gun or ammunition<sup><a href="#footnote-423" id="footnote-ref-423">[423]</a></sup> Any weapon;<sup><a href="#footnote-424" id="footnote-ref-424">[424]</a></sup> Any knife with a blade longer than two inches, except kitchen knives (which must be kept only in the kitchen of your home) and knives related to your employment (which may be used and carried only in connection with your employment); or A crossbow of any kind.Because you cannot own or have access to or control of any of these weapons/instruments, if you live with someone who has a gun, weapon, knife, or crossbow in your residence, you must make sure that the other person removes those items from the residence, or at least keeps the items locked in a place to which you don’t have access.You must waive extradition to the State of California from any other state or the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.). This means that you must give up the right to a formal procedure for returning you to California should you leave the state and get arrested or taken into custody. In other words, you cannot challenge any effort by California to return you to the state.<sup><a href="#footnote-425" id="footnote-ref-425">[425]</a></sup>If another jurisdiction (another state) has lodged a “detainer” against you (meaning that other state has ordered you be held there), you may be released to the custody of that state, which means that California will let that other state take control over your supervision and detention temporarily.<sup><a href="#footnote-426" id="footnote-ref-426">[426]</a></sup> However, if you are released from the other state’s custody before your California state parole would have ended, or if the other state decides not to hold you, you must immediately contact the nearest California state parole office for instructions on reporting to a parole agent.<sup><a href="#footnote-427" id="footnote-ref-427">[427]</a></sup>Almost no right against searches or seizures by a probation officer, a CDCR agent or officer, or any law enforcement/police officer. <em>See the next question</em> (PG. 164) for<em> more detailed information about searches and seizures while you’re on parole.</em></ol>

                <p><em>Unfortunately, one of the conditions of parole is that you have almost no right against searches and seizures by parole officers or other law enforcement, but you DO have some.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152806"></a>What are my rights to privacy of my person, residence, or property while on parole?</h3>
                <p class="text">Unfortunately, you lose most of your constitutional rights against searches and seizures while you’re on parole. Generally speaking, for people OFF PAROLE, the government and law enforcement cannot unreasonably search you or your property or take things from you; and if they do search you illegally, it can’t be used as evidence against you in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-428" id="footnote-ref-428">[428]</a></sup> BUT ON STATE PAROLE, you have very few rights when it comes to searches of your property, yourself, or your residence. If you are on state parole:</p>
                <ol class="text">You, your residence, and any property that you possess can be searched or seized (taken) by a probation officer, a CDCR agent or officer, or any other peace/police officer, at any time (day or night), with or without a search warrant, and with or without cause<sup><a href="#footnote-429" id="footnote-ref-429">[429]</a></sup> —even if other non-parolees live there with you.<sup><a href="#footnote-430" id="footnote-ref-430">[430]</a></sup>Officers can also search the passenger compartment of any car while you are a passenger, even if you are not the driver or owner of the car.<sup><a href="#footnote-431" id="footnote-ref-431">[431]</a></sup>If you are placed in custody pending parole revocation proceedings, parole agents and other law enforcement officers may search your property.<sup><a href="#footnote-432" id="footnote-ref-432">[432]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these conditions, even though they would violate the constitutional rights of someone who is not on parole or not under criminal justice.<sup><a href="#footnote-433" id="footnote-ref-433">[433]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">BUT—AND THIS IS A BIG BUT—A search of you, your residence, or your property that goes outside of the normal rules applied to all citizens CANNOT be justified if the officers who conducted the search did not know that you were on parole,<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-434" id="footnote-ref-434">[434]</a></sup></strong> or did not have<em> “probable cause” </em>to believe that you lived in the residence that was searched.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-435" id="footnote-ref-435">[435]</a></sup></strong> With that being said, however, if a law enforcement or parole officer knows that you are on parole, the officer is allowed to assume that you are subject to a parole search condition, in which a search without a warrant, reasonable suspicion or probable cause, and without your consent <em>are permitted</em>, since this is a general condition that applies to all people on parole.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-436" id="footnote-ref-436">[436]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “PROBABLE CAUSE”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">An officer has “probable cause” to search someone on parole, their residence, or their property when the officer has some heightened knowledge that they are at the address where either the parolee or the subject of an arrest warrant resides.<em>Motley v. Parks</em>, 432 F.3d 1072, 1079 (9th Cir. 2005) <em>overruled in part by</em> <em>United States v. King</em>, 687 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2012).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152807"></a>A<a id="paroleSS"></a>re there any additional limitations on searches while I’m on parole?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. Even when the officer knows or has <em>probable cause</em> to believe you are on parole, the one and only limit on parole searches is that such “<em>searches must be no more intrusive than necessary for a legitimate interest in parole supervision”.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-437" id="footnote-ref-437">[437]</a></sup>The courts have understood this to mean that parole searches must be constitutionally “reasonable”—meaning they cannot take place too often, at an unreasonable time of day, be unreasonably long, or be conducted in an “arbitrary or capricious” (unreasonable) manner.<sup><a href="#footnote-438" id="footnote-ref-438">[438]</a></sup> Searches cannot be motivated by the officer’s dislike of you, nor can they be used for non-legitimate law enforcement purposes (for example, to harass or embarrass you).<sup><a href="#footnote-439" id="footnote-ref-439">[439]</a></sup>When conducting a parole search of your house, law enforcement officers must give you notice of the officers’ authority and the purpose in conducting the search <em>prior to</em> entering your house.<sup><a href="#footnote-440" id="footnote-ref-440">[440]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152808"></a>What action can/should I take if a parole or law enforcement officer conducts a search that I believe is unlawful?</h3>
                <p class="text">A person on parole has little recourse (very few legal remedies) when law enforcement officers conduct an unlawful search because evidence that is obtained through an unlawful search can still be admitted at a parole revocation hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-441" id="footnote-ref-441">[441]</a></sup> Additionally, it is very rare for a court to even find that parole search was “unreasonable.” <em>If you believe that the search is unlawful, you should tell the attorney who is representing you. </em>At a parole revocation hearing, you and your attorney will be notified of evidence used against you (see PG. 183 for information on parole revocation hearings). </p>
                <h4 class="textbox">IN SUM, WHILE YOU ARE ON PAROLE, OFFICERS CAN SEARCH YOU OR YOUR PROPERTY:</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">WITHOUT your consent (your permission);WITHOUT a search warrant;WITHOUT “probable cause” or even reasonable suspicion that you violated parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-442" id="footnote-ref-442">[442]</a></sup> </ul>
                <p class="textbox">BUT…In order to search you or your property, an officer must know or have a reason to know that you are on parole or some other type of supervision. In court cases on this issue, judges have said that a search may be illegal if the parole officer didn’t know or have reason to know the person being searched was on parole. However, any items that are taken (seized) during the search may still be used as evidence against you in a later court proceeding or in a revocation hearing. Still, the search/seizure cannot be more intrusive than reasonable necessary.If you believe that you were subject to an illegal search, or a search where an officer did not have knowledge that you were on parole, tell your attorney, contact a Public Defender’s officer for help, or contact Root &amp; Rebound.</p>

                <p class="sidebox">The California Supreme Court has ruled that this voting ban only applies to people incarcerated in state prison (or in jail awaiting to be transferred to state prison to serve their prison sentence) and people on state parole. It does NOT apply to people otherwise incarcerated jail, or to people being supervised by county-level probation, including Mandatory Supervision or Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS). (<em>See </em>Scott et al. v. Bowen (2015).) This is a brand new ruling that expanded the right to vote to many more people in California!

In federal elections, the voting eligibility laws in the state where you live determine whether or not you have the right to vote if you have a felony convictions. Since these laws vary from state to state, if you ever move, you should look into the state’s voter requirements.YOU CANNOT SERVE ON A JURY — If you have a felony conviction on your record, you cannot serve on a jury in California, even after you are off parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-444" id="footnote-ref-444">[444]</a></sup> Unfortunately, that means you will not be able to serve on a jury for the rest of your life if you have a felony on your record.</ol>

                <p class="textbox">Yes. There are <em>discretionary</em> special conditions that your parole officer can impose on you if they meet certain legal standards (see PG. 273). There are also <em>mandatory</em> special conditions that are imposed on certain individuals because California state law requires them to be imposed.

                <h3>Who sets the special conditions of parole, and how do they decide?</h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">CAN I ASK FOR MY SUPERVISION LEVEL TO BE REVIEWED/ REDUCED?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Yes. Most parolees who complete 180 days of satisfactory parole will automatically be assigned to the “minimum supervision” category EXCEPT for people whose commitment offense is legally classified as “violent” (<em>see</em> Cal. Penal Code § 667.5); 290 registrants (<em>see</em> Cal. Penal Code § 290); people with cases that received a lot of media or public attention, and certain gang members (as documented on CDCR Form 812-A). If you are not one of the people who is automatically assigned to “minimum supervision” after 180 days of completing satisfactory parole, you can still request a reduction in supervision level by asking the unit supervisor, who can make a decision on a case-by-case basis. (Cal. Penal Code § 3504.)</p>
                <p class="text">The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and individual parole agents can require you to follow certain additional, <em>special conditions</em>, which are <em>special rules</em> you must follow while you are on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-448" id="footnote-ref-448">[448]</a></sup> If you are a “lifer” in California, or if you were released onto parole before July 1, 2013; or charged with a parole violation before July 1, 2013,<sup><a href="#footnote-449" id="footnote-ref-449">[449]</a></sup> then the BPH can also require you to follow certain additional, special parole conditions in those cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-450" id="footnote-ref-450">[450]</a></sup> If you are not a “lifer,” County Superior Court judges are in charge of handling parole conditions and revocations of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-451" id="footnote-ref-451">[451]</a></sup> County Superior Court judges may impose special parole conditions, but the special conditions must be reasonably related to (having to do with) the offense for which the person spent time in prison, or to the risk of each offender’s recidivism, and criminal history.<sup><a href="#footnote-452" id="footnote-ref-452">[452]</a></sup> </p>
                <p><em>Special conditions</em> required by CDCR and/or your parole agent will depend on your individual circumstances, including the following factors: your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you were incarcerated and are on parole for); criminal history; specific issues that may affect your risk of reoffending (called “criminogenic needs,” such as substance abuse, and family and social relationships);<sup><a href="#footnote-453" id="footnote-ref-453">[453]</a></sup> specific conditions required by law (called <em>mandatory</em> special condititions – see the box below for more information); and other parole expectations. Your <em>special conditions</em> will be part of your parole plan, and can change depending on how well you do on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-454" id="footnote-ref-454">[454]</a></sup> (See the next question to learn about what your parole plan is.)</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152813"></a>What is my parole plan?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your parole plan is an individualized plan to guide your parole supervision, which DAPO staff will prepare for you before your release based on an individual evaluation of your strengths, needs, and risks of reoffending. Your parole plan will include the following information: your strengths; risk of reoffending (risk level and “criminogenic needs” identified during your individual evaluation); goals for successful reentry (these will be related to your specific risk factors); specific “triggers” that may lead to negative behavior (such as strategies for successful reentry and avoiding negative “triggers”; special conditions of parole; supervision category; and other items.<sup><a href="#footnote-455" id="footnote-ref-455">[455]</a></sup> Your supervision category is based on DAPO’s initial evaluation of your risk of reoffending, and your progress while on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-456" id="footnote-ref-456">[456]</a></sup>You should receive a copy of your parole plan before you are released. While you are on parole, you should be meeting regularly with your parole agent to review your parole plan, your progress with specific goals and strategies, and other issues. Your parole agent will modify (change) your parole plan based on your progress and other changes in your situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-457" id="footnote-ref-457">[457]</a></sup> Your supervision category should also be reviewed periodically to determine whether it should be changed.<sup><a href="#footnote-458" id="footnote-ref-458">[458]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Victims and witnesses can also request special conditions, including no-contact provisions and/or that you are not paroled to the county where they live.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-459" id="footnote-ref-459">[459]</a></sup></strong> Read more about the special conditions that relate to victims and witnessed on PG. 178. It’s also likely that BPH or CDCR will place a no-contact provision for crime partners, preventing you from contacting/seeing anyone who was your co-defendant in the criminal case. Lastly, state law requires some special parole conditions for people convicted of certain types of offenses (these special conditions are called <em>mandatory</em>).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-460" id="footnote-ref-460">[460]</a></sup></strong> Specifically, there are <em>mandatory</em> special conditions for “Sex Offenders” (see PG. 170 for more information) and <em>mandatory </em>special conditions for “Mentally Disordered Offenders” (see PG. 174 for more information).<strong> </strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152814"></a>What are examples of common special conditions of state parole? </h3>
                <p class="text">The most common special conditions for a person on state parole are:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You cannot drink alcohol; You must submit to drug testing; orYou must participate in mental health treatment.<sup><a href="#footnote-461" id="footnote-ref-461">[461]</a></sup> GPS DEVI</strong><a id="gpsSTATEparole"></a><strong>CES– Some people on parole will be required to wear GPS tracking devices (usually, ankle monitors).

                <h3>When will I find out the conditions of my parole, and if any extra (special) conditions have been added?</h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Your parole may be revoked for 6 months if you (1) refuse to give any required DNA sample prior to release or (2) refuse to sign any documents acknowledging a duty to register as a sex offender. (<em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code § 3060.5). </p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>WHILE INCARCERATED:</strong></p>
                <p>You should find out about the conditions of your parole <em>at least 45 days</em> before your release: your correctional counselor should provide you with this information in a CDCR Form 1515, “Notice and Conditions of Parole.”<sup><a href="#footnote-465" id="footnote-ref-465">[465]</a></sup> You will be asked to sign the Form 1515.<sup><a href="#footnote-466" id="footnote-ref-466">[466]</a></sup> You will also be given a copy of Form 1515 for you to keep upon your release. </p>
                <p>If possible, even if you don't agree with a special condition given to you in the CDCR Form 1515, it is usually best for you to sign Form 1515 and comply with the conditions while at the same time taking the steps necessary to challenge any disputed condition. If you don't sign the form, you might not get out of prison until the matter is resolved.<sup><a href="#footnote-467" id="footnote-ref-467">[467]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>ONCE YOU’RE RELEASED:</strong></p>
                <p>When you are out and you first meet with your parole agent, your parole officer should give you a copy of your Form 1515 to keep and should explain ALL of the general and special conditions of your parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-468" id="footnote-ref-468">[468]</a></sup> It is important that you fully understand your parole conditions. If you do not understand your parole conditions, ask your parole agent to clear up and answer your questions or concerns.</p>
                <p>If your parole officer doesn’t present you with the Form 1515 in your first meeting, you should ask him or her to do so. Again, it is very important that the parole agent explains to you your conditions of parole, and if they do not, you should ask them to.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152816"></a>Am I legally protected from having certain unfair extra (special) conditions imposed on me? </h3>
                <p>Yes. A parole condition is invalid if it fails one of the following 4 legal tests:</p>
                <p><strong>TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if it:</strong></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Has no relation to the commitment offense; Bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and Requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities.<sup><a href="#footnote-469" id="footnote-ref-469">[469]</a></sup> </strong></p>
                <p><em>You must show that the condition does not meet any of the 3 factors. </em></p>
                <p>For example, courts have held that if a parolee has no history of alcohol abuse or committing crimes while intoxicated, alcohol testing cannot be imposed as a condition of parole because using alcohol is not illegal and the condition would not relate to the parolee’s past criminal conduct or future criminality.<sup><a href="#footnote-470" id="footnote-ref-470">[470]</a></sup></p>
                <p><strong>TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if it:</strong></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Infringes on (violates) a constitutional right ANDIs broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.<sup><a href="#footnote-471" id="footnote-ref-471">[471]</a></sup> </strong></p>

                <p class="textbox">The Proposition 83 (“Jessica’s Law”) residency restrictions on where people convicted of certain sex offenses can live was challenged as being so unreasonable, vague, and overbroad that it violates constitutional rights.<sup><a href="#footnote-488" id="footnote-ref-488">[488]</a></sup> In a number of counties, judges granted individual parolees temporary relief (excusing them from following the law, and allowing them to live in more places).<sup><a href="#footnote-489" id="footnote-ref-489">[489]</a></sup>In March 2015, the California Supreme Court decided that certain residency restrictions are unconstitutional as applied to all sex offender parolees in San Diego County.<sup><a href="#footnote-490" id="footnote-ref-490">[490]</a></sup> The Court decided that CDCR may still impose parole conditions on individual sex offenders on a case-by-case basis, including residency restrictions that may be more or less restrictive than Proposition 83.<sup><a href="#footnote-491" id="footnote-ref-491">[491]</a></sup>Since the March 2015 <em>In re Taylor</em> decision, the CDCR announced that it will stop enforcing the Proposition 83 residence restrictions throughout the entire state.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152821"></a>What does it mean to be classified as a mentally disordered offender (MDO)—and what are the mandatory special conditions placed on MDOs on state parole? </h3>
                <p class="text">“Mentally disordered offenders” (MDOs) are people who the California Department of Corrections (CDCR) has determined must receive inpatient treatment from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH)<sup><a href="#footnote-493" id="footnote-ref-493">[493]</a></sup> as a condition of their parole. To be committed as an MDO on parole, you must: </p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Be diagnosed with a serious mental illness that causes you to pose a substantial danger of physical harm to others, ANDHave been sentenced to prison for an offense involving violence.<sup><a href="#footnote-494" id="footnote-ref-494">[494]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152822"></a>Who determines whether a person on parole is classified as an MDO, and what is the process for making this decision?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are several steps to the MDO determination process by CDCR:</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1: First, CDCR mental health staff and a DSH psychologist or psychiatrist must screen you for classification as an MDO while you’re in prison.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-495" id="footnote-ref-495">[495]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: If both agree that you qualify as an MDO, the CDCR will send certification papers to the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) stating that you have been found to be an MDO.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-496" id="footnote-ref-496">[496]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: The BPH then notifies the prisoner that he or she will have to undergo DSH inpatient treatment as a condition of parole.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-497" id="footnote-ref-497">[497]</a></sup><strong> The BPH also MUST notify the prisoner of his or her right to challenge the MDO finding.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-498" id="footnote-ref-498">[498]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152823"></a>Can I challenge an MDO determination? If so, what is the process?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You can challenge the MDO finding by requesting a hearing before the BPH. If you challenge the finding, the BPH MUST do the following:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Have you evaluated by two independent mental health professionals, ANDMust hold a hearing in front of a BPH commissioner. At this hearing, the State of California must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (that it is more likely than not) that you are a Mentally Disordered Offender—again, that you are both (1) diagnosed with a serious mental illness that causes you to pose a substantial danger of physical harm to others AND (2) were sentenced to prison for an offense involving violence.<sup><a href="#footnote-499" id="footnote-ref-499">[499]</a></sup> If you want a lawyer at the hearing, the state must provide you one for free.<sup><a href="#footnote-500" id="footnote-ref-500">[500]</a></sup> </strong></p>
                <p class="text">If, at this hearing, the BPH commissioner determines that you are an MDO, and you want to challenge that finding, you can file a petition in the local superior court to demand a jury trial. The BPH must provide a prisoner who requests a trial with two things: (1) a petition form and (2) instructions for filing the petition. At trial, you have the right to an attorney for free and the district attorney will represent the State. The district attorney has the burden of proving “beyond a reasonable doubt” that you met the criteria of being classified as an MDO.<sup><a href="#footnote-501" id="footnote-ref-501">[501]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152824"></a>If I am found to be an MDO, and I want to be seen as an outpatient, is that possible?</h3>
                <p class="text">It might be possible. The normal rule is that if you are found to be an MDO on parole, you must be placed in <em>inpatient treatment</em> (confined to a state hospital to live and receive mental health treatment)—unless the Department of State Hospitals (DSH) finds that you can be treated safely as an outpatient.<sup><a href="#footnote-502" id="footnote-ref-502">[502]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">What is the “Department of State Hospitals (DSH)”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The DSH was created in 2012 to take over the functions of the now-defunct Department of Mental Health (DMH). DSH oversees inpatient mental health treatment facilities in California.<strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="text">However, after 60 days in DSH custody, you can request a hearing in front of a BPH commissioner to ask for outpatient status as an MDO (where you live in the community but go to a mental health hospital for treatment).<sup><a href="#footnote-503" id="footnote-ref-503">[503]</a></sup> At the hearing, the DSH must show by “a preponderance of the evidence” (that it is more likely than not) that you require inpatient treatment.<sup><a href="#footnote-504" id="footnote-ref-504">[504]</a></sup> At this hearing before the BPH, you have the right to a free appointed attorney (called a Panel Attorney)<sup><a href="#footnote-505" id="footnote-ref-505">[505]</a></sup> and the appointment of two independent evaluators, and you may appeal the decision in County Superior Court (see below for more information).<sup><a href="#footnote-506" id="footnote-ref-506">[506]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152825"></a>If I am found to be an MDO, when and how often is my MDO status reviewed?</h3>
                <p class="text">The Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) must review your status as an MDO when you reach your presumptive discharge date (PDD) (the date under state law that you should be discharged early from parole if the BPH doesn’t find a good reason to keep you: see PG. 154 to learn more about PDDs), and decide whether or not it recommends that you continue in your MDO inpatient placement or be discharged.<sup><a href="#footnote-507" id="footnote-ref-507">[507]</a></sup> If the BPH recommends that you continue in your MDO placement, it MUST hold <em>re-commitment</em> proceedings similar to the original MDO commitment procedures (see PG. 174 for information about the initial <a id="MDO"></a>MDO classification process that happens in prison before your release).<sup><a href="#footnote-508" id="footnote-ref-508">[508]</a></sup> An MDO who is re-committed multiple times could end up serving his or her entire time on parole in a DSH hospital.<sup><a href="#footnote-509" id="footnote-ref-509">[509]</a></sup> Before being re-committed, you’ll receive a written form notifying you of the decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-510" id="footnote-ref-510">[510]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS “RE-COMMITMENT”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Re-commitment refers to the process by which DSH decides that a person is still an MDO and must be confined in a DSH facility for another year.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152826"></a>Can the Department of STate Hospitals (DSH) hold me beyond my Maximum Discharge Date (MDD)?</h3>
                <p>Possibly. If you are classified as an MDO and reach your parole’s maximum discharge date (MDD) (The MDD is the maximum parole term as set by statute, after which the parolee must be discharged see PG. 154), the DSH can seek to continue the mental health commitment (meaning you have to stay in inpatient treatment) for 1 more year.<sup><a href="#footnote-511" id="footnote-ref-511">[511]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>If your MDO commitment is continued for an additional year, the DSH can continue to seek re-commitment every year.<sup><a href="#footnote-512" id="footnote-ref-512">[512]</a></sup> If the DSH seeks to continue your MDO commitment, the district attorney (prosecutor) will argue on behalf of DSH/ the State. You will also be appointed an attorney and a jury trial in county Superior Court. At the trial, the district attorney must prove that you still meet the MDO criteria—that you are still both: (1) diagnosed with a serious mental illness that causes you to pose a substantial danger of physical harm to others AND (2) were sentenced to prison for an offense involving violence.<sup><a href="#footnote-513" id="footnote-ref-513">[513]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">REMINDER of the legal test for adding Extra (special) conditions to your parole:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The courts have held that conditions of parole are invalid if they don’t meet the following 4 tests:TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if it: </p>
                <ul class="sidebox">Has no relation to the commitment offense; Bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and Requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities. </ul>
                <p class="sidebox"><em>You must show that the condition does not meet any of the 3 factors. </em>For example, courts have held that if a parolee has no history of alcohol abuse or committing crimes while intoxicated, alcohol testing cannot be imposed as a condition of parole because using alcohol is not illegal and the condition would not relate to the parolee’s past criminal conduct or future criminality. TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if it infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.<strong> </strong>TEST 3: A parole condition may be invalid if it is excessively broad or so vague that it cannot be understood and followed.For example, a parole condition prohibiting a parolee from associating with certain groups of people must include a requirement that the parolee knows or should know that any given individual is part of the prohibited group.TEST 4: A parole condition is invalid if it limits the type of employment you can have, but does not directly relate to the parolee’s crime.</p>

                <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIt’s suggested that you sign the Form 1515, and then challenge the condition later. Don’t refuse to sign!</h4>
                <p class="textbox">First, while you can and should challenge a condition of parole that you believe is unlawful, it is usually best for you to sign the “Notice and Conditions of Parole” (CDCR Form 1515, see example of this form in Appendix G, PG. 285) and comply with them while taking the steps necessary to challenge the disputed condition. Otherwise you may end up having to spend additional time in custody while the matter is being resolved.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152828"></a>How could I challenge a condition of parole that I believe is unlawful and invalid?</h3>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS PUT ON YOU BY BPH:</strong></p>
                <p>If you want to challenge a BPH decision or parole condition set by BPH, you do not need to file any administrative appeal UNLESS the issue involves a disability. This is because the BPH has no general administrative appeal process, so you can immediately challenge a BPH decision by filing a state petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Superior Court in the county of your parole.</p>
                <p class="text">Again, to learn when &amp; how to file a state petition for writ of habeas corpus, see Appendix K, PG. 297, at the end of this chapter.</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS PUT ON YOU BY PAROLE: </strong></p>
                <h4 class="step">APPEAL THE CONDITION: </h4>
                <p class="text">To challenge a parole condition, you generally must start by filing a CDCR <a id="form22howto"></a>Form 22, “Request for Interview, Item, or Service,” (see sample in Appendix I, PG. 292) and an administrative appeal, on CDCR Form 602. It’s best to file the Form 22 at the same time as the Form 602 appeal because the Appeals Coordinator may screen out a formal 602 appeal if you do not first submit a Form 22.<sup><a href="#footnote-514" id="footnote-ref-514">[514]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>The 602 administrative appeal may solve the problem, but even if it does not, courts usually will not consider a lawsuit challenging a CDCR decision unless the parolee has “exhausted administrative remedies.”<sup><a href="#footnote-515" id="footnote-ref-515">[515]</a></sup> Once you get a response, you should file the first level of 602 administrative appeal and go through all three levels of appeal, if necessary. </p>
                <p>There are some circumstances in which you may bring a court challenge without first filing an administrative appeal. These include situations where:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>There is no administrative remedy (for example, because the condition is required by a state law);An administrative appeal would not give you any relief; ORDelay could cause you irreparable harm such as risk of serious injury.<sup><a href="#footnote-516" id="footnote-ref-516">[516]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <h4 class="step">If you complete Step One and your 602 appeal is denied, you can then file a state writ of habeas corpus.</h4>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS A “WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">A writ of habeas corpus is when you petition a court, asking it to determine whether a parole condition is legal or not. </p>
                <p class="text"><em>WHEN?</em> You may consider filing a <em>writ of habeas corpus</em> when authorities or state officials have violated the federal Constitution or statutes or California’s Constitution, statutes, or regulations. <em>HOW?</em> See Appendix K, PG. 297 to learn how to file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus.<em>OTHER RESOURCES TO HELP YOU:</em> A state court habeas form and more information about state habeas cases can be found in the Prison Law Office’s State Habeas Corpus Manual.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152829"></a>How could I challenge a<em> </em>parole condition that is a problem for me because of a disability that I have?</h3>
                <p>If you cannot satisfy a parole condition because of a disability that you have, or if the parole condition is unfair to you because of your disability, the steps to challenge that condition are different than the appeals process discussed on PG. 175. To challenge a parole condition related to a disability that you have, you will first want to figure out which agency put the condition on you—Parole or the BPH—because the steps for challenging it are different depending on who put the condition in place.</p>
                <p class="text">IF THE CONDITION WAS PUT ON YOU BY PAROLE: You should file a CDCR Form 1824 Request (NOT a Form 22 and Form 602 appeal) (see a sample copy of that form in Appendix Q, PG. 310). See the section on “DISABILITIES” below at PG. 181 to learn more about that procedure.IF THE CONDITION WAS PUT ON YOU BY THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS (BPH): Normally you don’t need to file an appeal to challenge a parole condition that the BPH put on you, but it’s different if that condition relates to your disability or an accommodation that you need. To challenge a BPH condition related to your disability, you should fill out BPH Form 1074 “Request for Reasonable Accommodation,” (see a sample copy of that form in Appendix R, PG. 313), and send it to the BPH’s ADA Coordinator at:</p>

                <p>Sacramento, CA 95814</p>
                <p>If the response from the BPH is unsatisfactory (doesn’t solve the issue), you can submit you appeal to the Second and Third levels of appeal. </p>

                <p><em>In this section, you will learn how to request that your parole be transferred: from one county to another county, or from California to a different state. Keep reading to learn more!</em></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152831"></a>I want to transfer my parole to another county. How can I do that? </h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL TIP—REQUEST TRANSFER WHILE INCARCERATED:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If possible, you should make the request for transfer while you are still in prison—when the Release Program Study (CDCR Form 611) is being prepared. For more information about Form 611, the “Release Program Study,” see Appendix S, PG. 316.</p>
                <p>You can request a transfer to another California county while you are still incarcerated (recommended!) or after you are out and living in the community. If your transfer request is denied, you may challenge the denial by filing a 602 appeal (see above PG. 155).</p>
                <h4>HOW TO REQUEST WHILE YOU’RE INCARCERATED:</h4>
                <p>While you are still incarcerated in CDCR, it’s best to go to your correctional counselor to help you navigate your transfer request. You should ask him/her to submit a Transfer Investigation Request form (TIR). The correctional counselor will submit your TIR to the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) (for lifers), which generally discusses it with the District Attorney responsible for your case, to make a final decision, OR to the Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), which makes decisions about transfer requests for non-lifers.<sup><a href="#footnote-517" id="footnote-ref-517">[517]</a></sup> Try to work with the correctional counselor as much as possible.</p>
                <p>You should explain why being in a different county will help you be more successful living in the community. You should also provide supporting documents (such as letters from supportive family members, a doctor, a prospective employer) verifying the reasons that the transfer would be beneficial to your rehabilitation and reentry, and submit these supporting documents along with the correctional counselor’s Transfer Investigation Request (TIR) to the BPH.<sup><a href="#footnote-518" id="footnote-ref-518">[518]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>The BPH could deny your request to transfer your parole to another county if: </p>

                <h4>HOW TO REQUEST after you are released:</h4>
                <p>You should submit a verbal or written request to your parole agent. It’s recommended that you submit a written request, and make a copy and keep it in a safe place—just in case you don’t hear back and need to follow up with documentation. There is no special form that you need to use; your request can be submitted as a standard dated letter. <em>See the next question to learn about how your request should be processed by parole after it is received.</em></p>
                <p>You should explain to your parole officer why being in a different county will help you be more successful living in the community. You should also provide supporting documents (such as letters from supportive family members, a doctor, or a prospective employer) verifying the reasons that the transfer would be beneficial to your rehabilitation and reentry.<sup><a href="#footnote-520" id="footnote-ref-520">[520]</a></sup> </p>
                <h5 class="question">What should my parole agent do after I submit a verbal or written request to transfer counties?</h5>
                <p class="answer">A parole agent who receives a transfer request should prepare a Transfer Investigation Request form (TIR) and submit it to the parole unit supervisor. The supervisor should then consider the following factors:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Any need to protect the safety of the parolee, a victim, a witness, or other person;Any public concern that would reduce the chance that parole would be successfully completed;A verified work offer or an educational or vocational program;The existence of family with whom you have strong ties and whose support would increase the chance that you would successfully complete parole; andThe presence or lack of any needed mental health treatment programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-521" id="footnote-ref-521">[521]</a></sup></strong></p>

                <h3>I am on state parole—<em>or any other type of supervision</em>—and I want to transfer to another<em> </em>state. How can I do that?</h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE about interstate transfers:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision also governs the rules for all interstate transfers of state probation, including PRCS and Mandatory Supervision. </p>
                <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
                <p class="textbox">Because there is a limit on the number of “out-of-county” parolees who may be supervised in each county (meaning there’s a limit on transfers), once again, your request to transfer parole to another county in California may be denied even if some or all of these factors are favorable. It is best to put the strongest application possible forward, and to get as much support as you can, especially from your Parole Agent, correctional counselors, and anyone else you know working for the government—including judges, District Attorneys, Public Defenders, etc. It would also be great to get the support of leaders from the community you are hoping to transfer to. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The information below about transferring supervision between states applies not just to state parole, but to <em>ALL forms of community supervision</em>. Keep reading if you are on state parole; county probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision; or federal probation, supervised release or parole.</p>
                <p><em>First, some background:</em> a legal agreement between all of the states called <em>the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision</em> sets out the rules for transferring parole from one state to another (called “interstate parole transfer”).<sup><a href="#footnote-522" id="footnote-ref-522">[522]</a></sup> The Interstate Compact applies in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<sup><a href="#footnote-523" id="footnote-ref-523">[523]</a></sup> If you are classfied as a sex offender, there are special rules that apply to you in requesting to transfer your parole to a different state (see PG. 180).</p>
                <h4>IF YOU ARE currently INCARCERATED:</h4>
                <p>The earliest that California can send an interstate transfer request for you is 120 days before your expected release date (ERD) from prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-524" id="footnote-ref-524">[524]</a></sup> The receiving state is supposed to respond within 45 days of receiving a transfer request.<sup><a href="#footnote-525" id="footnote-ref-525">[525]</a></sup> The process can be sped up in an emergency.<sup><a href="#footnote-526" id="footnote-ref-526">[526]</a></sup></p>
                <h4>IF YOU ARE formerly incarcerated:</h4>
                <p>If you are out and living in the community, you may request to transfer your parole to a new state if you meet basic eligibility requirements. Read about those requirements below, and follow these steps:</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1: Generally speaking, you must meet the basic eligibility requirements to request to transfer your parole to a different state. The basic requirements are:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">You have 90 days (3 months) or more, or an undecided amount of time, left to serve on parole at the time your application is submitted to the state you wish to transfer to; You have a valid supervision plan; You have not had parole revoked and have no pending parole revocation charges; AND<em>EITHER</em> You are a resident of the receiving state <em>OR</em> You have family that lives in the state who is willing and able to assist you, and you can obtain employment or have another means of supporting yourself;<sup><a href="#footnote-527" id="footnote-ref-527">[527]</a></sup> ANDYou have paid off your restitution orders in California, unless a judge finds that releasing you to transfer parole to another state would be “in the interests of justice.”<sup><a href="#footnote-528" id="footnote-ref-528">[528]</a></sup></ol>
                <p><em>NOTE: Technically, if you do not meet these requirements, California and the state you wish to transfer to may still agree to transfer your parole if there is a very good reason (“good cause”) to do so.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-529" id="footnote-ref-529">[529]</a></sup></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: Request the transfer. If you meet the eligibility requirements above, you must request a transfer verbally or in writing from your parole agent. Again, we suggest making a written request to have a paper trail, and making a copy of your request and keeping it in a safe place. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: Your parole agent determines whether or not you meet the basic eligibility requirements. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 4: Your parole agent must submit a Transfer Request to CDCR’s California Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA for review.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 5: If California approves the transfer, it will be sent to the receiving state for review. It is then up to the state you wish to transfer to whether or not to accept you for parole supervision.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-530" id="footnote-ref-530">[530]</a></sup></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 6: If approved by both California AND the state you wish to transfer to, you will then be transferred.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-531" id="footnote-ref-531">[531]</a></sup></p>

                <p><strong>STEP 1: To get the process started, you should talk to your correctional counselor (if you are still incarcerated) or your parole agent (if you are out on parole). </strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: The parole agent should determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: If the requirements are met, the parole agent should submit a transfer application to the CDCR’s Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 4: If the CDCR approves the transfer application, the request will be sent to the receiving state.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-533" id="footnote-ref-533">[533]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>

                <ol class="text">The rules for parolees with <em>developmental disabilities</em> are in the Clark Remedial Plan (March 1, 2002), § VIII.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152835"></a>How will my parole officer know about my disability &amp; any accommodations that I need?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your correctional counselor in the prison must notify your parole agent about your disability and related special needs by giving information about your disability on CDCR Form 611, “Release Program Study” (RPS) (see copy of form in Appendix S, PG. 313) and accompanying forms that explain the accommodations you will require (CDCR Form 1845 for physical disabilities (example in Appendix T, PG. 319) and CDCR Form 128C-2 for developmental disabilities (example in Appendix U, PG. 322). If the information about your disability is not on your Release Program Study (RPS, CDCR Form 611—example in Appendix S, PG. 316)), tell your correctional counselor (if you’re still incarcerated) or your parole agent (if you’re out). If, after you talk to your correctional counselor or parole agent, your disability is not being recorded and accommodated, file an appeal. The appeal process is explained on PG. 182.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152836"></a>What kinds of accommodations must Parole make for me if I have a disability?</h3>
                <p>If you have a disability, parole staff must make the following accommodations:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>First, parole staff must make sure that you receive “effective communication” during all orientations, interviews, and supervision meetings, and when you are notified of conditions of parole and registration requirements. This means parole staff must provide any help necessary for you to understand the information that is being communicated. Examples include:</strong> <strong><sup><a href="#footnote-536" id="footnote-ref-536">[536]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <ol class="text">Assistance by a sign language interpreter for a hearing- impaired person;Reading aloud of written materials for a vision-impaired person; orSimplifying information for a developmentally disabled person.</ol>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Second, parole staff must make reasonable changes to procedures so that you can receive services in a location that is accessible to you. For example:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">If a disability makes it difficult for you to get to the parole office, the parole agent should meet you somewhere else, such as at your home.If the parole agent refers you to community service such as a drug treatment center, job center, or literacy center, the parole staff should make sure that you can actually get to the programs and services offered.If you are required to attend a program at the parole office (such as an outpatient clinic), that program must be accessible considering your special needs.</ol>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Third, if you are a prisoner who uses a wheelchair or other healthcare appliance (such as a cane, prosthesis, eyeglasses, or prosthetic eyes), you have the legal right to keep the device when you leave prison, even if the state provided you with the device.Fourth, if you are transported somewhere while you are out on parole, the parole staff must consider all of your disability needs in determining the mode of transportation to use. Lastly, if parole staff arrests you while you are on parole, they must take your disability into account in placing you under any physical restraints. For example:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">If you need to use a cane, the parole agent should not cuff you behind your back.</ol>

                <p>There is a special CDCR appeals process if you are a person with a disability asking for fair treatment or asking to get access to parole services or programs. Follow these steps:<sup><a href="#footnote-537" id="footnote-ref-537">[537]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="text"><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Fill out CDCR Form 1824 “Request for Modification or Reasonable Accommodation” (a yellow form, see Appendix Q, PG. 310). If you cannot fill out the form due to your disability, ask your parole agent, an advocate, or a friend or family member for help. All parole offices should have this form available. You do not need to request an informal review through Form 22 before filing a Form 1824 (as you do with a 602 appeal). <strong>STEP 2:</strong> If you get a First Level response from parole denying your request, you can appeal to the Second Level by attaching the original CDCR Form 1824 (find a sample copy in Appendix Q, PG. 310) to a regular CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal (find a sample copy in Appendix J, PG. 294), filling out Section F of CDCR Form 602. Send both forms to the Regional Parole Administrator (See Appendix D, PG. 294 for their contact information). </p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>If you get a Second Level response denying your request, you can send the appeal to the Third Level for review. </p>
                <p class="text"><strong>STEP 4:</strong> If you get a Third Level response denying your request, that means you have “exhausted” (completed) <em>all three levels</em> of the 1824 disability appeals process, and you can bring the issue to court by filing a<em> state petition for a writ of habeas corpus</em> in the superior court of the county of your parole.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152838"></a>What rights do I have during a parole revocation hearing to accommodate my disability?</h3>
                <p>Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you have the legal right to reasonable accommodations during parole violation/revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-538" id="footnote-ref-538">[538]</a></sup> Examples of accommodations include:</p>
                <ol class="text">Ensuring access to the hearing room for a parolee with mobility impairments;Providing Braille, taped documents, or reading assistance for a vision- impaired parolee;Providing assistance in communicating for a developmentally disabled parolee; ORProviding sign language interpretation for a hearing-impaired parolee.<sup><a href="#footnote-539" id="footnote-ref-539">[539]</a></sup></ol>
                <p>Just like all other aspects of parole, the CDCR’s parole staff must use “effective communication” and provide reasonable accommodations when interacting with you. That means they must use effective communication and provide reasonable accommodations when:</p>
                <ol class="text">Arresting you;Modifying your conditions of parole; or Imposing sanctions like flash incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-540" id="footnote-ref-540">[540]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p><strong><em>KEEP IN MIND:</em></strong></p>
                <p>If you are a disabled parolee who is having problems receiving help from parole staff, you can submit a CDCR Form 1824, “Request for Modification or Reasonable Accommodation,” (read more about this process on PG. 182 above). CDCR parole staff should also alert jail staff and the attorney appointed to you about what your needs are when revocation proceedings begin.<sup><a href="#footnote-541" id="footnote-ref-541">[541]</a></sup></p>
                <p>In the courtroom, your attorney and the court should be responsible for ensuring your needs are met throughout the court process.<sup><a href="#footnote-542" id="footnote-ref-542">[542]</a></sup></p>

                <p><em>Under AB 109, California’s “Realignment” law, there were major changes to the procedures required for California state parole revocations. These changes took effect on July 1, 2013.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-543" id="footnote-ref-543">[543]</a></sup><em> The new rules for revocation hearings laws are explained in this section. </em></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152840"></a>What were the major changes to the way that parole revocation hearings work under realignment (as of july 1, 2013)?</h3>
                <p class="listparagraph">CHANGE TO WHO HEARS THE CASE</p>
                <p>The biggest change is that local county Superior Courts are now responsible for hearing most parole revocation cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-544" id="footnote-ref-544">[544]</a></sup> Before July 1, 2013, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) was responsible for hearing all parole revocation cases, and now that responsibility has shifted to the courts for most cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-545" id="footnote-ref-545">[545]</a></sup> County Superior Court judges will be the ones hearing these cases in state court.<sup><a href="#footnote-546" id="footnote-ref-546">[546]</a></sup> One of the ideas behind this change was to create more transparency and fairness in parole revocation hearings—by having an independent, unbiased judge hear the case and weigh the evidence. </p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE FOR “LIFERS”:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">This change in the law means that if you were a “lifer” in prison, your parole revocation hearing will be before the BPH, not the local county superior court.</p>
                <p>However, the BPH will continue to hear certain cases. The BPH will continue to hear:</p>
                <ol class="text">Parole consideration for lifers (also called “parole suitability hearings”);Medical parole hearings; Cases regarding mentally disordered offenders” (MDOs); andCases regarding “sexually violent predators.” </ol>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>CHANGE TO WHERE YOU SERVE A SENTENCE FOR A PAROLE VIOLATION</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">If your parole is revoked for a parole violation that occurred <em>on or after July 1, 2013</em>, you will be sentenced to COUNTY JAIL, not state prison. If your parole is revoked for a parole violation that occurred <em>before July 1, 2013</em>, you would have been sent back to state prison, so this is a big change in the law!THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION: If you are a parolee classified as a “serious offender” (meaning you were a life-term prisoner under California Penal Code § 3000.1 or convicted of certain types of sex offenses under California Penal Code § 3000(a)(4), you will be sent back to CDCR to serve time in state prison for a parole revocation, and then you will go back to the BPH, who retains jurisdiction, for future consideration in determining whether or not to discharge you back onto parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-547" id="footnote-ref-547">[547]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>HOW LONG YOU SERVE YOUR SENTENCE</strong></p>
                <p>If you serve your parole violation (revocation) term in country jail, you will serve a MAXIMUM of 180 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-548" id="footnote-ref-548">[548]</a></sup> Most people do serve their parole revocation terms in county jails. </p>
                <p>But, if you are a former lifer, you may be sentenced to a maximum of 12 months in prison for a parole violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-549" id="footnote-ref-549">[549]</a></sup> People who have maximum parole periods that are life-long (some people convicted to sex offenders or murder) may be sentenced to up to a year in prison for revocations, unless, at sometime during that year sentence, BPH determines that the person should be incarcerated longer.<sup><a href="#footnote-550" id="footnote-ref-550">[550]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152841"></a>If I am suspected of a parole violation, who has the authority to arrest me? Do they need a warrant to arrest me?</h3>
                <p class="text">A parole agent or police officer can arrest you if he or she has <em>probable cause</em> (meaning a reasonable belief of a prudent person based off of the specific facts)<sup><a href="#footnote-551" id="footnote-ref-551">[551]</a></sup> to believe you violated a condition of parole. BUT the arresting agent/officer <em>does not need a warrant</em>. A judge in the court COULD issue a warrant, but does not have to.<sup> </sup>(Cal. Penal Code § 3000.08(c)). If the parole officer suspects that you have violated a term of your parole, then you can be arrested by a parole agent or peace office at any time until the judge makes a final decision about your guilt or innocence of the case (called a “final disposition”).<sup><a href="#footnote-552" id="footnote-ref-552">[552]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152842"></a>What happens if I am arrested for an alleged parole violation? </h3>
                <p>Here is what you can expect if you are arrested for an alleged parole violation:</p>
                <ol class="text">After an arrest, a CDCR parole agent can place you on “hold”— meaning place you in jail pending further proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-553" id="footnote-ref-553">[553]</a></sup> Once you are on “hold,” CDCR parole staff then decides if there is “good cause” to believe that you violated the law or a condition of your parole. The staff does not have to hold a hearing or give you a chance to provide more information, but they have to come to this decision among themselves.<sup><a href="#footnote-554" id="footnote-ref-554">[554]</a></sup>It depends whether or not CDCR staff finds probable cause when they look over the alleged violation.If CDCR staff does not find probable cause, you will be re-released on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-555" id="footnote-ref-555">[555]</a></sup>If CDCR staff does find probable cause, they must decide whether “intermediate sanctions” can address the violation, or whether a formal revocation proceeding needs to happen. Intermediate sanctions might include:	New parole conditions;Sending you to a special reentry court;Requiring your participation in treatment or rehabilitation programs; or“Flash incarceration”—which is detention in the county jail for up to 10 consecutive days.<sup><a href="#footnote-556" id="footnote-ref-556">[556]</a></sup> If CDCR staff decides that intermediate sanctions are not enough, they will file a formal parole revocation petition in the local superior court.<sup><a href="#footnote-557" id="footnote-ref-557">[557]</a></sup>The CDCR’s petition should describe:The relevant conditions of parole;The circumstances of the violation;The history and background of the parolee; andParole staff’s recommendations for disposition (meaning their recommendations on what the outcome of the parole revocation petition should be). At this point, CDCR staff should inform you of your rights, including: (1) the right to consult with an attorney, and (2) that if you don’t have the money to hire an attorney, you have the right to have the court provide you a free attorney (the Public Defender will be appointed). We recommend that you consult with an attorney or public defender before waiving any rights.</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORANT: CDCR may inform you that you have the right to waive both your right to an attorney and your right to a hearing, admit the parole violation, and accept the CDCR’s proposed revocation term (sometimes called a “screening offer”). The waiver of an attorney or hearing must be in writing.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-558" id="footnote-ref-558">[558]</a></sup></strong> AGAIN, WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU ASK TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY, AND IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE, THAT YOU WAIT FOR YOUR FREE ATTORNEY TO COME MEET WITH YOU. Please note: There is currently no timeline required for these steps to happen, which is concerning.</p>
                <p>Currently, the law does not set any timelines for parole revocation steps.<sup><a href="#footnote-559" id="footnote-ref-559">[559]</a></sup> CDCR staff should make a probable cause determination within 2 business days after a hold is placed, notify a parolee of charges and rights within 3 business days after the hold, and either file a revocation petition with the court or release the parolee within 7 business days after the hold. However, these timelines are not formal regulations and the CDCR is not obligated to enforce them.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152846"></a>What is the legal standard for finding a person guilty of a parole violation? </h3>
                <p>At the parole revocation hearing, the judge must decide whether a “preponderance of the evidence” (meaning 51% or more than half of the evidence) supports the charges. In other words, the District Attorney must prove that it is <em>more likely than not</em> that you violated parole. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152847"></a>If I go to jail on a parole violation, am I entitled to bail?</h3>
                <p>No.<sup><a href="#footnote-562" id="footnote-ref-562">[562]</a></sup> You have no right to bail on a pending parole violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-563" id="footnote-ref-563">[563]</a></sup> However, a court could still grant it. Once a court has “jurisdiction” (legal authority to hear the case) over a petition to revoke your parole, the court is allowed to set bail and release the parolee on his or her own recognizance (meaning the judge can decide that bail and/or release would be appropriate in that case).<sup><a href="#footnote-564" id="footnote-ref-564">[564]</a></sup> Your parole violation hearing must be held within 90 days if you are not released on bail.<sup><a href="#footnote-565" id="footnote-ref-565">[565]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152848"></a>What rights do I have during a parole revocation hearing?</h3>
                <p>Parole cannot be suspended or revoked by the Superior Court Judge unless there is good cause (a good reason) to believe that a person has violated the conditions of his or her parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-566" id="footnote-ref-566">[566]</a></sup></p>
                <p>As a parolee, your rights are as follows:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Written notice of the alleged violation(s) (the rule or law that parole claims you have broken) and the possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain evidence that would help explain the situation, or justify it;<sup><a href="#footnote-567" id="footnote-ref-567">[567]</a></sup>Disclosure of the evidence against you (just like at trial);<sup><a href="#footnote-568" id="footnote-ref-568">[568]</a></sup>Timely hearing of the charges at a probable cause hearing and a formal revocation hearing (within 90 days if you were not granted bail);<sup><a href="#footnote-569" id="footnote-ref-569">[569]</a></sup>The right to present witnesses and documentary evidence.<sup><a href="#footnote-570" id="footnote-ref-570">[570]</a></sup> The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who speak out against your interest.<sup><a href="#footnote-571" id="footnote-ref-571">[571]</a></sup> You have a conditional right under the U.S. (federal) and California (state) constitutions to cross-examine people whose statements are used against you in a parole violation proceeding.<sup><a href="#footnote-572" id="footnote-ref-572">[572]</a></sup> BUT SEE NOTE BELOW!A neutral and detached (unbiased and fair) hearing body (meaning, the Superior Court Judge);<sup><a href="#footnote-573" id="footnote-ref-573">[573]</a></sup> andA written statement of the decision, the evidence relied on, and the reasons for revoking parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-574" id="footnote-ref-574">[574]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! You may waive (give up) your right to a parole revocation by admitting that you violated parole.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-575" id="footnote-ref-575">[575]</a></sup></strong> It is important that you SAY SOMETHING if you believe your rights are violated during the process or in a hearing. If you are unsure if your rights have been violated or if you don’t understand your rights, ask your lawyer or public defender. If you do not have a lawyer or public defender, call your local public defender’s office. </p>
                <p class="text">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WITNESSES! Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you at your parole revocation hearing if they are deemed <em>fearful</em> or <em>confidential</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-576" id="footnote-ref-576">[576]</a></sup> Be sure to speak to your lawyer about all potential witnesses—those both for your and against you—prior to your hearing. <strong>“Fearful witnesses”</strong> are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee’s presence, but your attorney must be present.<strong>“Confidential witnesses”</strong> are witnesses, whose identity is not known to you, and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.<sup><a href="#footnote-577" id="footnote-ref-577">[577]</a></sup> However, if confidential information is used as part of the evidence that you violated parole, you can ask the District Attorney (prosecutor) to show you this information. If the District Attorney refuses to show you this information, then he or she must prove that showing you this information would create a risk of harm to the informant. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152849"></a>What happens if a “material” (very important) state witness doesn’t show up to the parole revocation hearing, even though he/she was required to attend?</h3>
                <p>If a material (very important) state witness fails to attend a parole revocation hearing and the hearing cannot fairly proceed without the witness, the court can postpone the hearing or dismiss the case.</p>
                <p>To decide whether the witness’s testimony would be “material,” the court will balance the importance of the witness’s expected testimony against the availability and reliability of another source of the same information. Also, if the state’s material witnesses fail to appear, but <em>your witnesses</em> are present, you and your attorney may want to ask that the judge take the testimony of your witnesses before postponing the rest of the hearing.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152850"></a>Can the district attorney introduce evidence at my parole hearing that was found in an unlawful search &amp; seizure?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Unfortunately, the “exclusionary rule,” which applies in criminal cases, does not apply in parole revocation hearings. This means that this evidence may be used in parole revocation hearings, even if it would be excluded from a criminal court trial, or already was excluded from a criminal court trial related to the same issue.<sup><a href="#footnote-578" id="footnote-ref-578">[578]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="textbox">SUMMARY of SENTENCINGWhat are the court’s 3 options for sentencing/ punishment if it finds that I violated my state parole?</h4>
                <p class="textbox">The court’s 3 options are: </p>
                <ul class="textbox">Return you to parole supervision with changes (called “modifications”) to your conditions of parole, including possible time in county jail;Refer you to a Reentry Court or other Evidence-Based Practice program; orRevoke your parole and order confinement.<sup><a href="#footnote-579" id="footnote-ref-579">[579]</a></sup></ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152851"></a>If the judge revokes my parole and orders me back into custody, where will I serve and for how long?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends on your conviction history.(1) MOST PEOPLE – Almost everyone who has his or her parole revoked will serve the parole revocation sentence in county jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-580" id="footnote-ref-580">[580]</a></sup> You will most likely get 180 days in county jail, even if there were multiple grounds for the revocation.<sup><a href="#footnote-581" id="footnote-ref-581">[581]</a></sup> You can earn “half-time” credit on parole revocation sentences (meaning 2 days “good conduct credit” for every 2 days actually served in custody), regardless of the nature of the commitment offense or parole violation. If you are serving a parole revocation sentence and you violate jail rules or refuse to do assigned work, then you may lose some or all of your good conduct credits.<sup><a href="#footnote-582" id="footnote-ref-582">[582]</a></sup>(2) FORMER “LIFER” –There are different rules if you are on parole after serving an indeterminate prison term of “life with the possibility of parole” (a.k.a. “former lifers”). If you are a former lifer:</p>
                <ol class="text">You can get a parole revocation sentence term of up to 12 months;You are not entitled to earn good conduct credits; andYour revocation sentence could be extended if you violate rules while you are in custody.<sup><a href="#footnote-583" id="footnote-ref-583">[583]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">(3) CERTAIN SEX OR MURDER CONVICTIONS – There are also different rules for people convicted of certain sex offenses or certain murder convictions:<sup><a href="#footnote-584" id="footnote-ref-584">[584]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">If you have life-long parole (some people convicted of sex offenses or murder) and it gets revoked, you’ll be sent back to prison, not county jail.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-585" id="footnote-ref-585">[585]</a></sup></sup>Within 1 year of being returned to prison, a two-member BPH panel will hold a hearing. The panel must release you within 1 year of the date of the revocation—unless it determines the seriousness of the parole violation requires longer incarceration for public safety. If the two-member BPH panel keeps you in prison longer than 1 year, you have the legal right to a parole consideration hearing every year afterwards.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-586" id="footnote-ref-586">[586]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152852"></a>What rights do I have if I am a person with a disability going through parole revocation proceedings? </h3>
                <p>Under a federal law called the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you have the legal right to reasonable accommodations during parole violation/revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-587" id="footnote-ref-587">[587]</a></sup> Examples of accommodations could include:</p>
                <ol class="text">Ensuring access to the hearing room for a parolee with mobility impairments;Providing Braille, taped documents, or reading assistance for a vision-impaired parolee;Providing assistance in communicating for a developmentally disabled parolee; ORProviding sign language interpretation for a hearing-impaired parolee.<sup><a href="#footnote-588" id="footnote-ref-588">[588]</a></sup></ol>
                <p>Just like all other aspects of parole, the CDCR’s parole staff must use “effective communication” and provide reasonable accommodations when interacting with you. That means that they must use effective communication and provide reasonable accommodations when:</p>
                <ol class="text">Arresting you;Modifying your conditions of parole; or Imposing sanctions like flash incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-589" id="footnote-ref-589">[589]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text"><em>KEEP IN MIND: </em>If you are a disabled parolee who is having problems receiving help from parole staff, you can submit a CDCR Form 1824, “Request for Modification or Reasonable Accommodation,” (read more about this process on PG. 182 above). CDCR parole staff should also alert jail staff and the attorney appointed to you about what your needs are when revocation proceedings begin.<sup><a href="#footnote-590" id="footnote-ref-590">[590]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152853"></a>How do I challenge (appeal) a parole revocation decision or action made by the county superior court?</h3>
                <p>If you are challenging a decision made by the county superior court, you should be able to file a direct appeal under the statute that allows an appeal “from any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.”<sup><a href="#footnote-591" id="footnote-ref-591">[591]</a></sup> Follow these steps:</p>
                <p>STEP 1: To appeal, the parolee must file a Notice of Appeal in the Superior Court within 60 calendar days after the original court’s decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-592" id="footnote-ref-592">[592]</a></sup></p>
                <p>STEP 2: When a timely Notice of Appeal is filed, the Superior Court will prepare a record of the parole revocation proceedings consisting of all the documents filed in the original court and transcripts of the hearings; the court will then provide these documents to the Court of Appeal, the State, and you (the parolee). In a direct appeal, the Court of Appeal must appoint a free attorney to represent you if you do not have enough money to pay for a private attorney.<sup><a href="#footnote-593" id="footnote-ref-593">[593]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you do not file a timely Notice of Appeal, or if the issue involves information outside the court record, then you may be able to raise the issues in a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152854"></a>What types of issues could I bring up in a challenge to parole revocation proceedings, decisions, or actions?</h3>
                <p>There are many types of issues that you can raise in a challenge to a revocation proceeding or decision. For this reason, we recommend that you speak with your attorney if you believe that your rights have been violated! Your claim could be based on violations of state or federal constitutional due process rights, California or federal statutes, or California administrative rules. For example, you could argue that:</p>
                <ol class="text">The revocation hearing is being unreasonably delayed;You were denied the right to cross-examine witnesses at the parole revocation hearing; or The evidence did not support the revocation decision.</ol>
                <p>UNFORTUNATELY—in most cases, the process for raising such challenges will be too slow to provide you any relief before you have served the entire parole revocation sentence term. BUT You may still benefit by:</p>
                <ol class="text">Getting your parole revocation cases re-heard;Getting their revocations vacated; and/or Getting the time served for the revocation deducted from the controlling parole discharge date.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152855"></a>What is the process for appealing a decison made by CDCR?</h3>
                <p class="text">You can challenge a CDCR action or lack of action in these stages by filling out a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal (see Appendix J, PG. 294 for copy of form) and submitting it to the CDCR’s parole agent. </p>
                <p>Possible uses for a 602 appeal include challenging the CDCR’s decision to place a parole hold or find probable cause for a violation, asking for an attorney for the early stage of the revocation process, or challenging a delay by CDCR in filing a formal petition.<sup><a href="#footnote-594" id="footnote-ref-594">[594]</a></sup></p>
                <p>There are two reasons for filing a CDCR Form 602 administrative appeal and re-filing it to the highest level necessary:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>First reason—It might solve the problem.Second reason—Courts usually require you to “exhaust administrative remedies” (meaning that you pursued all three levels administrative review before filing a case in court) and that you filed an appeal before filing a lawsuit in court claiming that the CDCR violated your legal rights.<sup><a href="#footnote-595" id="footnote-ref-595">[595]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p class="text">After completing any required administrative remedies, you can challenge a CDCR or BPH action or decision by filing a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus. If the judge issues an “order to show cause,” it must appoint a free lawyer to represent you if you request one and show that you do not have enough money to pay for a private lawyer.<sup><a href="#footnote-596" id="footnote-ref-596">[596]</a></sup> See Appendix K, PG. 297 for information on when and how to file a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus<strong>.</strong></p>

                <p>Probation is a suspended state prison or county jail sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-597" id="footnote-ref-597">[597]</a></sup> In other words, instead of doing the full amount of time in custody (in prison or jail), you can stay in the community under supervision and be required to follow certain rules and conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-598" id="footnote-ref-598">[598]</a></sup> The primary purpose of probation is rehabilitation.<sup><a href="#footnote-599" id="footnote-ref-599">[599]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>All probation sentences are different. However, there are some <em>standard conditions</em> that apply to most, if not all, people on county-level probation in California. If you have a disability, you should get certain accommodations on probation, so make sure you see PG. 181 to learn about requesting the accommodation(s) you need. Each county is responsible for running its own probation department, and each of these departments has its own specific rules. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152858"></a>How did California’s “Realignment law” change California’s probation System?</h3>
                <p>The Realignment Law (“A.B. 109”) fundamentally changed <em>sentencing law</em> and created new forms of community supervision in California. Because of prison overcrowding, the Supreme Court ordered California to lower the number of people it was holding in its state prisons. In order to do this, California decided to keep only people convicted of certain serious felonies in prison. It transferred the responsibility of people convicted of felonies that are considered non-serious and non-violent from the state prisons and parole board to the county jails and probation departments. This means that: </p>
                <ol class="text">If you are convicted after October 1, 2011, of a felony that falls within the Realignment definition of non-serious, non-violent, and non-sexual (the 3 “nons” or “non-non-non”), you will serve your time in county jail instead of state prison. (You also must not have any prior serious, violent or sexual felony convictions.) Under Realignment, there is also the possibility that you might be allowed to serve some of your sentence on community supervision, instead of spending the full term in custody.If you were convicted of a “non-non-non” with no priors before October 11, 2011, and you are serving your sentence in prison, you will be put on county-level supervision (PRCS) instead of state parole when you are released.</ol>
                <p class="text">Here are the 4 types of community supervision after Realignment: (1) <strong>informal probation</strong> (also known as “summary” or “court” probation); (2) <strong>formal probation</strong>; (3) <strong>Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS) </strong>(new after Realignment) and (4) <strong>Mandatory Supervision</strong> (new after Realignment).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152859"></a>What types of supervision now fall under the control of county probation after realignment?</h3>
                <p><strong>Here is a quick overview of the different types of supervision that are now under the control of county probation departments in California after Realignment:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Informal Probation</strong> (also known as summary or court probation): Informal probation is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by the court, and not by a probation officer. A judge may order informal probation for misdemeanor convictions, but not for felony convictions at the time you’re sentenced; however, if you receive formal probation for a felony conviction, your supervision level may be later reduced to informal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-600" id="footnote-ref-600">[600]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 193. <strong>Formal Probation</strong>: Formal probation is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by a probation officer. It’s the minimum supervision that a judge can order for a felony conviction, and it can also be given out for some more serious misdemeanor convictions and people who have prior convictions.<sup><a href="#footnote-601" id="footnote-ref-601">[601]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 198.<br/><em>(Note: Depending on the type of felony, you may not be on probation, but rather on state parole, which is covered separately, beginning on PG. 146.)</em> <strong>Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS)</strong>: PRCS is a new type of supervision created by Realignment. Now, people who are released from state prison after serving a sentence for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual crime will be supervised by local county probation officers instead of state parole officers. PRCS can last for up to 3 years, but will end after 1 year if you do not violate any of your PRCS conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-602" id="footnote-ref-602">[602]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 201.<strong>Mandatory Supervision:</strong> Mandatory supervision is also a new type of supervision created by Realignment. If you were convicted of a “non-non-non” felony, California state courts are allowed now to use a tool called “split sentencing,” which allows a judge to split the time of a sentence between time in jail and a period of supervision by a county probation officer. This period of supervision after the jail term is called Mandatory Supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-603" id="footnote-ref-603">[603]</a></sup> To learn more, go to PG. 207.</ol>

                <h3><a id="msdprobationinfo"></a><a id="_Toc448152862"></a>What is Informal probation (also known as summary probation or court probation)?</h3>
                <p>Informal probation (also known as “summary probation” or “court probation”) is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by the court, and not by a probation officer. If you are convicted of a misdemeanor in California, you <em>may</em> be placed on informal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-604" id="footnote-ref-604">[604]</a></sup> Note: You may also end up on informal probation after spending a certain amount of time on formal probation, and probation deciding to lower your supervision level.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152865"></a>What are some good first steps to take when I am first placed onto informal probation?</h3>
                <p>Instructions for what to do when you first start your probation term will be different depending on what county you are being supervised in. The best thing to do when you are first placed on informal probation (whether you were in jail or not), is to call or visit your county probation department immediately to find out what requirements and instructions apply to you.</p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152866"></a>Length of Informal Probation</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152867"></a>How long is informal probation?</h3>
                <p>The length of your informal probation depends on what the court ordered, which usually depends on what county you are being supervised in. Under state law, your period of informal probation may last up to five years, but it is often less, depending on the county you were convicted in.<sup><a href="#footnote-605" id="footnote-ref-605">[605]</a></sup> Each county sets its own mandatory minimum probation term (which can be as low as one year). Remember, every county in California operates differently.<sup><a href="#footnote-606" id="footnote-ref-606">[606]</a></sup> </p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152868"></a>Getting Off Informal Probation</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152869"></a>Can I get off informal probation early? </h3>
                <p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from your informal probation term.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-607" id="footnote-ref-607">[607]</a></sup></sup> Some people are able to satisfy all of the conditions of their probation (all of the things the court orders you to do—such as attend counseling or paying restitution) before their probation term is up. For this reason, judges are often willing to release people from probation early.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-608" id="footnote-ref-608">[608]</a></sup></sup> The process is the same for asking a court to terminate your informal probation, formal probation, or Mandatory Supervision early. If your request (called a “Motion”) to end your informal probation early is granted by the judge, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record! For more information on how to file a Motion for Early Termination of Probation, and how to request to have your eligible convictions dismissed, please see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</p>

                <p class="sidebox">For example, if you are unemployed due to a disability, and unable to make restitution payments to the state, the court may order you to instead complete community service (Cal. Penal Code § 1202.4(n)). But if your probation is revoked, the court must impose restitution instead (Cal. Pen. Code § 1202.4(n)).</p>
                <p>Once informal probation is ordered, the court will decide what conditions of probation to impose on you. Below is some general information to know about your conditions of probation.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis"><strong><strong>Conditions set by the Criminal Court Judge: </strong></strong></div>
                <p>The judge in the criminal court has a lot of freedom in determining the conditions of your informal probation, and is allowed to impose any <em>reasonable</em> conditions for the purposes of rehabilitation or to protect the community.<sup><a href="#footnote-609" id="footnote-ref-609">[609]</a></sup> However, the court cannot impose a condition that is unreasonable or that does not properly take into consideration the circumstances of your case.<sup><a href="#footnote-610" id="footnote-ref-610">[610]</a></sup></p>
                <p>Informal probation conditions differ from offense to offense. Some common examples of informal probation conditions are:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>“Violate no laws” –</strong> This is a general condition for everyone on informal probation, that means you cannot break any laws while you are on informal probation (minor traffic offenses do NOT count);<strong>No-contact (stay away) orders –</strong> These prevent you from being around or communicating with certain individuals; <strong>Restitution Payments OR Community Service –</strong> Courts are required to order restitution payments, either to the victim or to the state, as a condition of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-611" id="footnote-ref-611">[611]</a></sup> <em>Read more about restitution payments in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717.</em><strong>Up to 1 year in county jail</strong>;<sup><a href="#footnote-612" id="footnote-ref-612">[612]</a></sup><strong>Anger management courses</strong>; <strong>Substance abuse treatment programs</strong>;<strong>Restrictions on your ability to have access to or carry weapons</strong>;<sup><a href="#footnote-613" id="footnote-ref-613">[613]</a></sup><strong>Fines of up to $1,000</strong>;<sup><a href="#footnote-614" id="footnote-ref-614">[614]</a></sup><strong>Minimum Fine or Jail Sentence Sometimes Required by Law – </strong>For some misdemeanor convictions, the court is required to impose a minimum fine or jail sentence as a condition of your probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-615" id="footnote-ref-615">[615]</a></sup></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152872"></a>If I am on informal probation, will I have to report to a probation officer?</h3>
                <p>No. If you’re on informal probation, you’ll report to the County Superior Court.<sup><a href="#footnote-616" id="footnote-ref-616">[616]</a></sup> How you will report and how often you will have to report are up to the judge. In some cases, the judge may ask you to appear in court for “progress reports” to make sure you are following the conditions of your probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-617" id="footnote-ref-617">[617]</a></sup>In most cases, however, you will not actually have to appear in court -- the court will monitor your progress through your attendance in required courses or treatment programs. But, if you fail to attend these courses or programs, you may have to go to court to explain to the judge why. Make sure you contact the probation department in your county for a list of courses or treatment programs that the court recognizes and accepts.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152873"></a>What will the judge look for if I Have to go to court for “progress reports?”</h3>
                <p>When you go to court for a “progress report,” the judge will be checking to see if you are following the conditions of your probation. The judge will also ask you about your participation in any programs (i.e. AA meetings, anger management classes) that you were assigned as part of your probation. </p>
                <p>It is important that you BRING DOCUMENTATION of any progress or positive steps that you’ve made toward fulfilling your probation conditions. For example, you should bring written proof of your attendance in court-ordered treatment programs, or of the number of hours of community service or public works service you have completed.</p>
                <h3><a id="PP_County_MandatorySup_ChangingCondition"></a><a id="PP_County_MSD_ChangingCondition"></a><a id="_Toc448152874"></a>How do I change a condition of my informal probation?</h3>
                <p>Under state law, you can ask the judge to modify (change) your probation terms AT ANY TIME.<sup><a href="#footnote-618" id="footnote-ref-618">[618]</a></sup> This does not mean the judge will do so, but you can always ask!</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT IS "GOOD CAUSE”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">“Good cause,” means a reason(s) that is persuasive enough to convince a judge that s/he should make an order.</p>
                <p>To ask the judge to change a condition of your probation, you will have to file a motion with the court that is monitoring your probation, asking that your probation conditions be modified. You must show why there is a good reason (“good cause”) for the judge to modify your conditions. Remember to bring all documentation of your progress with you to court (i.e. reports/attendance sheets from any classes or courses that you were required to take as part of your misdemeanor probation).</p>
                <p>There is no standardized statewide form for requesting a modification of probation conditions, but some counties may have local forms for this purpose. You can contact the county Superior Court clerk’s office to find out if there is a local form for requesting a change. If not, you and your attorney will have to draft a motion. If you had a Public Defender assigned to your case, you can ask him or her to file a motion to modify your probation terms for you. If you had a private attorney but can no longer afford one, you may call the Public Defender’s Office and ask if they will represent you in your attempt to change your probation conditions. </p>
                <p>Before the judge can modify your conditions, the court must notify the prosecutor (the District Attorney) in your case, and hold a hearing in which the prosecutor will have a chance to speak.<sup><a href="#footnote-619" id="footnote-ref-619">[619]</a></sup> If the judge decides to change your conditions, he or she must state the reasons for doing so.<sup><a href="#footnote-620" id="footnote-ref-620">[620]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="text">For more information on the process for filing a motion to modify the conditions of your probation, see Appendix Y, PG. 330.</p>
                <p><strong><em>IF YOU ARE ASKING FOR THE CHANGE BECAUSE OF A DISABILITY:</em></strong></p>
                <p>If you are asking to change a condition because of a disability, you should explain why your disability makes it difficult for you to comply with your current probation conditions, and what changes (in conditions) or assistance (from the probation department or other services) you need to successfully complete your probation. For example, if you were ordered to perform <em>public works</em> service (like highway cleanup), but your disability prevents you from doing so, you may ask the judge at the local county superior court for a <em>modification</em> that allows you to do <em>community</em> service (like volunteering at the local public library) instead.</p>
                <p>When you go to court, remember to BRING DOCUMENTATION OF YOUR DISABILITY and explain the reasons why your disability makes it difficult for you to follow the current conditions and rules of your probation.</p>

                <p>The California Superior Court of the county in which you were convicted of a crime has jurisdiction (decision-making power) over your county-to-county probation transfer.<sup><a href="#footnote-621" id="footnote-ref-621">[621]</a></sup></p>
                <p>A judge will decide whether your transfer is appropriate, and will look at:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Permanency of your residence (whether you actually live in the transfer county permanently);Local programs available for you in the transfer county; andRestitution orders and victim issues.<sup><a href="#footnote-622" id="footnote-ref-622">[622]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p>Below is the process for one county’s probation department to submit a “notice of motion for transfer” in order to send your supervision to a different county’s probation department. <sup><a href="#footnote-623" id="footnote-ref-623">[623]</a></sup> <em>(Note, this process also applies to transferring Mandatory Supervision from one county to another.)</em></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>First, when you are released on probation, the court in the county where you were convicted must transfer the case to the superior court in the county where you plan to live permanently (or for the rest of your probation), <em>unless</em> the court determines that the transfer would be inappropriate.Next, the proposed receiving county may provide comments on the record about the proposed transfer.The transferring court and the transferring probation department must investigate your transfer and must make a speedy decision.If victim restitution was ordered as a condition of your probation, the transferring court determines the amount of restitution before the transfer, unless that court can’t make that decision within a reasonable period of time from when the transfer was requested. If a case is transferred without the amount of restitution being decided, the transferring court must make a determination about the restitution amount as quickly as possible. For every other determination related to probation (besides the amount of victim restitution), the receiving county will have the power to make those decisions, and must agree to do so.The transfer order must require you to be in the care and custody of the probation officer of the receiving county.If it applies, the transfer order must also include an order for reimbursement of reasonable costs for processing the transfer to be paid to the transferring county.The transferring county must send copies of any orders and any probation reports to the court and the probation officer in the receiving county within 2 weeks of finding that the you permanently reside in or have permanently moved to the receiving county.The receiving county may also follow these rules and procedures to again transfer your probation supervision to another county later on.</strong></p>

                <h2 class="subheading2">Basics of Formal Probation</h2>
                <h4 class="sidebox">What’s the main difference between formal and informaL probation?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The main difference between formal and informal probation is that, unlike with informal probation, if you are on formal probation, you are assigned a probation officer.</p>
                <h3><a id="felonyprobationinfo"></a><a id="_Toc448152882"></a>What is formal probation? </h3>
                <p>Formal probation is a type of community supervision that is part of the original sentence handed down by a judge at trial, as an alternative to or in addition to incarceration, for most felonies (those that did not lead to prison time or supervision under PRCS or Mandatory Supervision) and some misdemeanor convictions.<sup><a href="#footnote-625" id="footnote-ref-625">[625]</a></sup></p>
                <p>Formal probation reduces or eliminates the time you must spend in custody, and allows you to either remain in or return sooner to the community, so long as you follow your probation conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-626" id="footnote-ref-626">[626]</a></sup></p>
                <p>This means that some people never serve time in custody for their conviction, but instead are sentenced to formal supervision in the community, while other people are sentenced to some time in custody, plus formal supervision in the community afterward.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152883"></a>Who will monitor me on formal probation?</h3>
                <p class="text">Depending on the circumstances, either the court (and the judge of that court) or a probation officer will monitor you to make sure you follow your probation conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-627" id="footnote-ref-627">[627]</a></sup> Generally, you must report to the probation officer once a month, although the judge could require you to report more or less often than that.<sup><a href="#footnote-628" id="footnote-ref-628">[628]</a></sup> It is very important to remain in contact with your probation officer, or it could trigger a probation violation hearing. In some counties, your probation officer may allow you to report to them through a kiosk at a local probation office. <sup><a href="#footnote-629" id="footnote-ref-629">[629]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! How formal probation operates, and what services are available, varies from county to county. Ask your probation officer what is available to you in your county.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152885"></a>What are some of my responsibilities when I first get released onto formal probation? </h3>
                <p>Instructions for what to do when you first start your probation term will be different depending on what county you are being supervised in. When you first get out, the best thing to do is call or visit your county probation department immediately to find out what requirements and instructions apply to you.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152887"></a>How long will I be on formal probation?</h3>
                <p class="text">Formal probation is typically imposed for a term of 3–5 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-630" id="footnote-ref-630">[630]</a></sup> The length of your probation depends on what the court ordered, and that usually depends on what county you are being supervised in (since each county has some discretion to set the minimum length of formal probation within this range).<sup><a href="#footnote-631" id="footnote-ref-631">[631]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152888"></a>Can I get off formal probation early?</h3>
                <p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from your probation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-632" id="footnote-ref-632">[632]</a></sup></sup> If you have completed all of the conditions of your probation (for example, paid all fines/fees, completed all counseling) and you are at least halfway through your probation term (for example, 1 ½ years through a 3-year probation term), you may be a good candidate to have your probation ended early. The process for terminating (ending) formal probation early is the same as the process for ending informal probation or Mandatory Supervision early. If your request (called a “Motion”) to end your formal probation early is granted by the judge, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record!

                <p class="text">Before you are released from prison, a correctional counselor will screen your case and decide whether to refer you to state parole or PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-647" id="footnote-ref-647">[647]</a></sup> The correctional officer should start this screening process at least 180 days prior to your calculated release date.<sup><a href="#footnote-648" id="footnote-ref-648">[648]</a></sup> The CDCR Form 611, “Release Program Study” (RPS) (see example in Appendix S, PG. 316) is used to determine if you will be eligible for PRCS after release.<sup><a href="#footnote-649" id="footnote-ref-649">[649]</a></sup></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152905"></a>What must I do when I first get out on PRCS?</h3>
                <p class="text">You must report to your County Probation Department for PRCS supervision within 2 working days after your release from state prison, court, or county jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-650" id="footnote-ref-650">[650]</a></sup> Instructions for what to do when you first get out on PRCS vary from county to county. Please see Appendix Z on PG. 332 for some examples of the PRCS release process in a few California counties.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152906"></a>Where will I be released to on PRCS?</h3>
                <p class="text">In most cases, you will be sent to the county of your last legal residence before you were incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-651" id="footnote-ref-651">[651]</a></sup> However, CDCR can send you to PRCS in a different county for various reasons, including victim safety concerns, to help you maintain family ties, or so you can benefit from work or educational programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-652" id="footnote-ref-652">[652]</a></sup>Please keep reading for more information on how to make a request to be sent to a different county other than the one you last legally lived in.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152907"></a>Can I request that CDCR send me to PRCS in a different county than where they want to send me? </h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. While you are in prison, you can request to be released on to PRCS in a different county than where CDCR has assigned you—which is typically the county of last legal residence. Please read the section on how to request a PRCS County Transfer, beginning on PG. 205.</p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152908"></a>Length of PRCS</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152909"></a>Who sets the length of PRCS?</h3>
                <p class="text">The Superior Court Judge who sentences you. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152910"></a>How long does PRCS supervision last?</h3>
                <p class="text">PRCS can last a minimum of six months, and a maximum of 3 years. Remember PRCS can end earlier if you do not violate any conditions of your PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-653" id="footnote-ref-653">[653]</a></sup> If at any time you abscond (go missing) or are otherwise unavailable for supervision, that amount of time will not count toward the total PRCS period.<sup><a href="#footnote-654" id="footnote-ref-654">[654]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">a note about ADDING EXTRA (special) conditions of prcs:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The county probation office may send special conditions to CDCR prior to release, but they must be related to your offense. So CDCR can make the PRCS conditions, and then the local county probation office can add to those conditions, if the new conditions are lawful. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152911"></a>Can I get off PRCS early?</h3>
                <p class="text">It’s possible. If you have no violations of your PRCS, the county probation department that supervises you <em>may</em> discharge you after 6 consecutive months of no violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-655" id="footnote-ref-655">[655]</a></sup> However, early release from PRCS is discretionary—it’s up to the supervising agency to decide. Most individuals discharge from PRCS within 30 days after serving a continuous year without violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-656" id="footnote-ref-656">[656]</a></sup></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152913"></a>What conditions must I follow if I am on PRCS?</h3>
                <p class="text">You must comply with all of your conditions on PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-657" id="footnote-ref-657">[657]</a></sup> The standard conditions include:</p>
                <ol class="text">A waiver of your Fourth Amendment Rights—agreeing to be searched by law enforcement without probable cause;Informing the Probation Department of your home and work addresses; andNever possessing or having access to weapons.<sup><a href="#footnote-658" id="footnote-ref-658">[658]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152914"></a>Is there a document where I can find all my PRCS conditions?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes—you should refer to your signed CDCR Form 1515, “Notice and Conditions of Parole” (see Appendix G, PG. 285 for an example of this form).<sup><a href="#footnote-659" id="footnote-ref-659">[659]</a></sup> If you do not sign the conditions while you are still incarcerated, the prison/jail staff will notify the county of your supervision, and you can be held in custody until you sign Form 1515 or until your credits expire.<sup><a href="#footnote-660" id="footnote-ref-660">[660]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="PP_County_PRCS_ChallengingCondition"></a><a id="_Toc448152915"></a>Can I challenge a PRCS condition?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. The legal standards for determining whether a PRCS condition is unlawful are generally the same as for parole conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-661" id="footnote-ref-661">[661]</a></sup> Please refer to, PG. 175 to understand what makes a PRCS or parole condition lawful or unlawful.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152916"></a>How do I challenge a PRCS condition?</h3>
                <p class="text">The procedure will depend on whether the supervising agency (the county probation department) or the court made the decision, and when the challenge is being raised.<strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS SET BY THE PROBATION OFFICER SUPERVISING YOUR PRCS:</strong> then you should complete any administrative appeal or grievance process that is available through Probation. If there is no administrative appeal process or the administrative appeal is unsuccessful, then you can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the local superior court.<sup><a href="#footnote-662" id="footnote-ref-662">[662]</a></sup> See Appendix K PG. 297 to learn how to file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus.<strong>IF THE CONDITION WAS SET BY THE COURT JUDGE OR A COURT-APPOINTED HEARING OFFICER:</strong> then you should be able to proceed with a court challenge. It appears likely that a direct appeal can be filed under the statute that allows an appeal to be filed “from any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.” To appeal, you must file a notice of appeal in the superior court within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision. <strong>When a timely notice of appeal is filed, </strong>the superior court will prepare a record of the parole revocation proceedings with all the documents filed in the court AND transcripts of the hearings, and will provide these documents to the Court of Appeal, the State, and to you (the parolee). </p>
                <ol class="text">In a direct appeal, an attorney will be appointed by the Court of Appeal at state’s expense, if the parolee does not have enough money to pay for one. If you wish to have a court-appointed attorney, you must file your notice of appeal within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision. </ol>
                <p class="text">If the notice of appeal is not timely filed or if the issue involves information that is not in the court record, it might be possible to raise the issues in a state court habeas corpus petition. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Whether or not issues from your case can be raised on a habeas appeal can be a difficult subject to determine. For this reason, it is recommended that you seek help from a court-appointed attorney, if possible. Again, remember that if you wish to have a court-appointed attorney, you must file your notice of appeal within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision.</p>
                <p class="text">Please refer to Appendix K, on PG. 297 for more information on direct appeals and state habeas corpus petitions, including sample forms.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152917"></a>What could happen if I do not follow the conditions of my PRCS?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are different types of consequences for not following (violating) the terms and conditions of your post-release community supervision (PRCS). These include:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS:</strong> PRCS agencies are supposed to develop and use “intermediate sanctions” for minor violations of PRCS conditions. Intermediate sanctions could include programs like drug treatment, mental health counseling, and job assistance.<sup><a href="#footnote-663" id="footnote-ref-663">[663]</a></sup><strong>FLASH INCARCERATION:</strong> Another type of punishment for violating a PRCS condition is “flash incarceration.” Flash incarceration is an immediate return to jail for a period of up to 10 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-664" id="footnote-ref-664">[664]</a></sup> One of the conditions for being placed on PRCS is that you give up the right to demand a court hearing before being subject to flash incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-665" id="footnote-ref-665">[665]</a></sup> <strong>COURT PETITION TO MODIFY/REVOKE/TERMINATE PRCS:</strong> If the PRCS supervising agency (the county probation office) decides that more serious punishment is appropriate for the violation, the agency will file a petition to modify, revoke, or terminate PRCS through the County Superior Court. The probation office’s petition will be filed with a hearing officer appointed by the local Superior Court. Either the supervising agency (probation department) or the hearing officer can decide to keep a person in custody (in jail) while the petition is pending.<sup><a href="#footnote-666" id="footnote-ref-666">[666]</a></sup></ol>

                <p class="text">California state law governs the process for transferring a person’s PRCS between counties.<sup><a href="#footnote-667" id="footnote-ref-667">[667]</a></sup> Unlike with transfers of informal probation, PG. 193, formal probation, PG. 198, and Mandatory Supervision, PG. 207,<sup><a href="#footnote-668" id="footnote-ref-668">[668]</a></sup> the Court does NOT have the authority to transfer a person’s PRCS. Instead, the PRCS transfer process is administrative, and happens directly from one county to another.<sup><a href="#footnote-669" id="footnote-ref-669">[669]</a></sup> Under law, the process for transferring counties on PRCS is as follows:</p>
                <h4 class="step">The supervising agency (the county probation department) must determine that:</h4>
                <p class="text">You no longer permanently reside (see definition in footnote)<sup><a href="#footnote-670" id="footnote-ref-670">[670]</a></sup> within its jurisdiction, ANDYour change of residence was either approved by probation OR didn’t violate the terms and conditions of your PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-671" id="footnote-ref-671">[671]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="step">The supervising agency (the county probation department) then has 2 weeks in which they must send any information it received from CDCR before you were released over to the receiving probation department in your new county of permanent residence.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-672" id="footnote-ref-672">[672]</a></sup></strong>Once the receiving county probation department has verified your permanent residency in its county, the agency must accept you on PRCS there.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-673" id="footnote-ref-673">[673]</a></sup></strong></h4>
                <p class="text"><em>NOTE: Your supervising agency (the county probation department) is not required to transfer your PRCS to another county unless you have shown your ability to establish permanent residence within another county without violating the terms and conditions of your PRCS.</em> </p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152928"></a>What is mandatory supervision? </h3>
                <p class="text">If you receive a split sentence (jail and community supervision time), you could be placed on Mandatory Supervision after your release from county jail. California’s 2011 Realignment law (AB 109) has given criminal courts in California a legal tool called “split sentencing.”<sup><a href="#footnote-684" id="footnote-ref-684">[684]</a></sup> Split sentencing allows a judge to split the time of a person’s sentence between a jail term and a period of supervision by a probation officer. While Mandatory Supervision is <em>not technically</em> probation under law, it will feel the same—you will be supervised by a county probation officer, and it will feel a lot like probation in how the supervision functions.<sup><a href="#footnote-685" id="footnote-ref-685">[685]</a></sup><em>Please note:</em> Mandatory Supervision is run by the counties and rules vary from county to county across California. We have tried to provide information here that will be helpful to all, but we encourage you to find out information from your particular county probation office about how Mandatory Supervision operates, and what services or programs are available to you there.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152929"></a>Who can be released onto mandatory supervision?</h3>
                <p>You are eligible for a “split sentence” and Mandatory Supervision if your felony conviction is for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sex offense (the “3 nons”) under law.<sup><a href="#footnote-686" id="footnote-ref-686">[686]</a></sup></p>
                <p>You CANNOT get a “split sentence” if:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You have a prior or current felony conviction for a serious felony described in Cal. Pen. Code § 1192.7(c);You have a prior or current conviction for a violent felony described in Cal. Pen. Code § 667.5(c);You have a prior felony conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that has all the elements of a serious or violent felony discussed directly above;You are required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Cal. Pen. Code § 290 et seq.; ORYour conviction included a sentence enhancement pursuant to Cal. Pen. Code § 186.11.</strong></p>
                <p>These 5 categories of individuals will still have to serve their sentence in state prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-687" id="footnote-ref-687">[687]</a></sup></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152931"></a>What must I do after I get released onto Mandatory Supervision?</h3>
                <p>You must report to your County Probation Department for Mandatory Supervision within 2 working days after your release from state prison, court, or county jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-688" id="footnote-ref-688">[688]</a></sup></p>
                <p>Other instructions for what to do when you first get out on Mandatory Supervision vary from county to county, and you should check with your local county’s probation office for a list of all the requirements.</p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152932"></a>Length of Mandatory Supervision</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152933"></a>How long will I be on mandatory supervision?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. The judge in the court that convicted you sets the term and length of mandatory supervision, and it is different for every person depending on what your conviction is for. BUT there are limitations. Split sentences cannot be longer than the maximum sentence possible for the conviction—meaning the total time you serve in custody (in jail) and supervision time (time on Mandatory Supervision) cannot be more than the maximum original sentence.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152934"></a>Can I get off mandatory supervision early?</h3>
                <p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from mandatory supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-689" id="footnote-ref-689">[689]</a></sup></sup> It is entirely up to the judge to decide whether to terminate your mandatory supervision early. Since they are given so much discretion, some judges (and even some whole counties) are unwilling to let people off of mandatory supervision early, regardless of the person’s progress. Many judges see mandatory supervision as an alternative to incarcerating you for the whole time (that’s why it’s called “split sentencing” because the judge split your sentence between incarceration and being on mandatory supervision in the community), so for the most part they are less likely to end your mandatory supervision early as compared with probation. We recommend that you speak with an attorney BEFORE filing a “Motion to Terminate Mandatory Supervision” early. If you go ahead with asking a judge to end your mandatory supervision early (such a request is called a “Motion”) and it is granted, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record! For more information on how to file a Motion to Terminate Probation early, and also how to request dismissals of eligible convictions, please see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029.</p>

                <p>If you’re on Mandatory Supervision, the violation and revocation process works the same way as it does for informal probation and formal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-694" id="footnote-ref-694">[694]</a></sup> Please read the violation and revocations information on PG. 211, for a description of the law and how the process works.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152945"></a>I have a disability. What rights do I have regarding accommodations for my disability?</h3>
                <p>The federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California state law<sup> </sup>protect you against discrimination based on your disability, and protect your rights to equal treatment and reasonable accommodations.</p>
                <p>If you are on probation (informal or formal), PRCS, or Mandatory Supervision<sup><a href="#footnote-695" id="footnote-ref-695">[695]</a></sup>, you have the right to:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Reasonable accommodations and changes in procedures so that you can participate in probation services, programs, and activities, and can successfully complete the terms of your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-696" id="footnote-ref-696">[696]</a></sup> EXAMPLES INCLUDE:If you are in a wheelchair, probation staff should make sure that any programs, meetings, and services are in wheelchair-accessible buildings.If your probation officer refers you to community service (such as a drug treatment center, job center, or literacy center), or requires you to complete a program, the probation staff should make sure that you can actually get to the services and participate in the programs.If you are required to complete a work program, probation staff should make sure that you are given a (alternative) job that you are able to do with your disability. Effective communication so that you can fully understand and participate in probation programs, services, activities, and proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-697" id="footnote-ref-697">[697]</a></sup> This includes communication during orientations, interviews, and supervision meetings; when you are notified of conditions of probation and registration requirements; and during grievance and revocation proceedings. EXAMPLES include:Assistance by a sign language interpreter for a hearing- impaired person;Reading aloud of written materials for a vision-impaired person; orSimplifying information for a developmentally disabled person.Additional assistance (including services) and aids (like healthcare devices) to accommodate your disability and ensure that you can fully and successfully participate in programs, activities, and services. EXAMPLES include:Providing sign language interpretation if you are hearing impaired or Wheelchair assistance if you have difficulty walking and cannot access a building.<sup><a href="#footnote-698" id="footnote-ref-698">[698]</a></sup>Information about your right to receive accommodations and equal treatment, and how this affects your probation programming and requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-699" id="footnote-ref-699">[699]</a></sup> </strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152946"></a>How can I request an accommodation or file a complaint if I feel that probation is not accommodating my disability, or if I am not getting access to probation services or programs?<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-700" id="footnote-ref-700">[700]</a></sup></sup></strong></h3>
                <p class="text">Unlike for state parole, there are no formal probation policies or procedures to request accommodations or file a complaint related to your disability. Each county does things differently, and many counties have no formal procedures. You can first talk to your probation officer and explain the situation to him/her OR you may ask a judge to modify your probation to accommodate your disability by filing a motion requesting a change. Please Appendix AA, on PG. 333, for detailed steps on the process. </p>

                <p class="text">The following questions and answers apply to most forms of county-level community supervision in California, including informal probation, formal probation, and Mandatory Supervision, <em>but NOT Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS).</em></p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152948"></a>Pre-hearing</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152949"></a>What is the probation revocation process in California?</h3>
                <p>The following probation revocation process applies to: (1) informal probation, (2) formal probation, and (3) Mandatory Supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-701" id="footnote-ref-701">[701]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152950"></a>What could happen if I don’t follow the conditions of my probation?</h3>
                <p>If any probation officer, parole officer, or police officer has probable cause to believe that you are violating any term or condition of your supervision, the officer may re-arrest you (even without a warrant) and bring you before the court.<sup><a href="#footnote-702" id="footnote-ref-702">[702]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>This is the case so long as you are on probation—at any point until the time your probation terminates or your case is dismissed. Alternatively, the court may, in its own discretion, issue a warrant for your re-arrest.<sup><a href="#footnote-703" id="footnote-ref-703">[703]</a></sup></p>
                <p>If you willfully miss a scheduled court date/ “progress report,” this is considered a probation violation and the court will issue a bench warrant for your arrest.<sup><a href="#footnote-704" id="footnote-ref-704">[704]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152951"></a>Can I be revoked for not paying restitution?</h3>
                <p>Yes, BUT not if you cannot afford to pay. If you do not pay restitution, your probation can be revoked.<sup><a href="#footnote-705" id="footnote-ref-705">[705]</a></sup> But your probation will not be revoked due to a failure to pay restitution unless the court determines that: 1) you have the ability to pay, and 2) you willfully failed to pay.<sup><a href="#footnote-706" id="footnote-ref-706">[706]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152952"></a>Can flash incarceration be used as an intermediate sanction?</h3>
                <p>If you are on informal probation, formal probation, or Mandatory Supervision flash incarceration CANNOT be used as an intermediate sanction. Flash incarceration can ONLY be used for people on parole or PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-707" id="footnote-ref-707">[707]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152953"></a>Am I entitled to bail?</h3>
                <p>It depends. Bail amounts for probation violations vary from county to county. Bail amounts for probation violations may also vary depending on the type of offense you were convicted of, and whether you are on informal or formal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-708" id="footnote-ref-708">[708]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>If you have internet access, you can usually find standard felony and misdemeanor bail amounts for probation violations (also referred to as “bail schedules”) on your county Superior Court’s website.<sup><a href="#footnote-709" id="footnote-ref-709">[709]</a></sup> Or you may call your county public defenders office to ask them about bail amounts for probation violations.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152954"></a>What does the court have the power to do to my probation status? </h3>
                <p>The court can:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Reinstate your probation with the same probation terms and conditions;Reinstate and modify (meaning change the terms or conditions of your probation), Revoke and terminate (meaning take away your probation and sentence you to jail or prison time). The court can modify, revoke, or terminate probation’s supervision of you on its own motion or upon the petition (a formal, legal request through the court) of you, the probation or parole officer, or the District Attorney. This applies to informal probation, formal probation, and Mandatory Supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-710" id="footnote-ref-710">[710]</a></sup>.</strong></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152956"></a>What court will hear my case?</h3>
                <p>The court in the county in which you are supervised has “jurisdiction” (the legal authority) to hear the motion or petition to modify, revoke, or terminate you probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-711" id="footnote-ref-711">[711]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>For those on probation, it will be either the court in the county in which you are supervised or the court in the county in which the alleged violation of supervision occurred.<sup><a href="#footnote-712" id="footnote-ref-712">[712]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152957"></a>Who hears the cases?</h3>
                <p>Judges, magistrates, or court-appointed hearing officers hear probation revocation cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-713" id="footnote-ref-713">[713]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152958"></a>Who represents the interest of probation in the hearing?</h3>
                <p>The District Attorney (DA), on behalf of the state of California.<sup><a href="#footnote-714" id="footnote-ref-714">[714]</a></sup></p>
                <a id="_Toc448152959"></a>
                <h3>What does the prosecutor (D.A.) need to prove? </h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">What does “preponderance OF THE EVIDENCE” mean?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Requires the court to find that more than half of the evidence at least 51% of it supports the charges or alleged probation violation.</p>
                <p>The prosecutor, also known as the District Attorney (DA), must prove that is more likely than not that you violated probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-715" id="footnote-ref-715">[715]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>Unlike a criminal trial where the DA must prove the case “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the DA in a probation revocation hearing only needs to prove by a “preponderance of the evidence” that you violated probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-716" id="footnote-ref-716">[716]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152960"></a>Do I have a right to notice of the probation revocation hearing?</h3>
                <p>Yes, unless you waive the notice requirement in writing.<sup><a href="#footnote-717" id="footnote-ref-717">[717]</a></sup></p>
                <p>You must be given notice before your first court appearance in the probation revocation proceedings, unless you agreed in writing to a modification (a change) or termination (an end) of a specific term of your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-718" id="footnote-ref-718">[718]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>If you agreed in writing to a modification or termination of a specific term of your supervision, you also do not have to make an in-person appearance in court for the hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-719" id="footnote-ref-719">[719]</a></sup> We suggest that you speak with an attorney or public defender prior to waiving your right to a revocation hearing. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152961"></a>Do I have the right to an attorney at the hearing?</h3>
                <p>Yes.<sup><a href="#footnote-720" id="footnote-ref-720">[720]</a></sup> Before you waive the requirement to personally appear at the hearing or before you accept an offer of modification of your probation conditions, you should be informed that you have the right to an attorney, and if you cannot afford one, you have the right to a free attorney provided by the court.<sup><a href="#footnote-721" id="footnote-ref-721">[721]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>If you waive the right to an attorney, this waiver must be in writing.<sup><a href="#footnote-722" id="footnote-ref-722">[722]</a></sup> Again, we suggest that you speak with an attorney or public defender prior to waiving your right to a revocation hearing.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152962"></a><a id="PP_PRHearingstandards"></a>What rights do I have during a probation revocation hearing?</h3>
                <p>There are minimal due process requirements for probation revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-723" id="footnote-ref-723">[723]</a></sup> This means that you don’t have all of the same rights that you have at trial.<sup><a href="#footnote-724" id="footnote-ref-724">[724]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>You have the following rights:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Written notice of the alleged violations and the possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain mitigating evidence (meaning evidence that would lessen the perceived severity of the violation or help justify it);<sup><a href="#footnote-725" id="footnote-ref-725">[725]</a></sup>Disclosure of the evidence against you;<sup><a href="#footnote-726" id="footnote-ref-726">[726]</a></sup>Timely hearing of the charges at a probable cause hearing and a formal revocation hearing;<sup><a href="#footnote-727" id="footnote-ref-727">[727]</a></sup>The right to present witnesses and evidence.<sup><a href="#footnote-728" id="footnote-ref-728">[728]</a></sup> You can subpoena and present witnesses and evidence.<sup><a href="#footnote-729" id="footnote-ref-729">[729]</a></sup> A person served with a subpoena for a parole revocation hearing is required to appear at the hearing unless the hearing is held at a place outside the county of his or her residence and more than 75 miles from his or her residence;<sup><a href="#footnote-730" id="footnote-ref-730">[730]</a></sup>The right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.<sup><a href="#footnote-731" id="footnote-ref-731">[731]</a></sup> You have a conditional right under the U.S. and California constitutions to confront witnesses whose statements are used against you in a probation violation hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-732" id="footnote-ref-732">[732]</a></sup> This means that you or your attorney may cross-examine any people who gave information or testified that you violated your probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-733" id="footnote-ref-733">[733]</a></sup> A fair and unbiased hearing body;<sup><a href="#footnote-734" id="footnote-ref-734">[734]</a></sup> andA written statement of the decision, the evidence relied on, and the reasons for revoking parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-735" id="footnote-ref-735">[735]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You may waive (give up) your rights, either expressly—by saying you give up the right, or by implication—by failing to assert the right.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-736" id="footnote-ref-736">[736]</a></sup></strong> Therefore, it is important that you take advantage of your rights and complain if a right is violated.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152963"></a>Can the prosecutor (d.a.) introduce evidence that was obtained in violation of my fourth amendment right against unlawful search &amp; seizure at my probation revocation proceeding?</h3>
                <p>Yes.<sup><a href="#footnote-737" id="footnote-ref-737">[737]</a></sup> You should note that the “exclusionary rule” that usually applies in a criminal court trial—a rule that bars evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—does NOT apply in probation revocation hearings. This means that even if evidence was suppressed in an earlier criminal trial, it can still most likely be brought in to a later parole revocation hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-738" id="footnote-ref-738">[738]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152964"></a>Can a witness be excused from testifying in front of me at a probation revocation hearing?</h3>
                <p>Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you if they are deemed <em>fearful</em> or <em>confidential</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-739" id="footnote-ref-739">[739]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">“Fearful witnesses” are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee’s presence, but the parolee’s attorney must be present.“Confidential witnesses” are witnesses whose identity you are unaware of and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.<sup><a href="#footnote-740" id="footnote-ref-740">[740]</a></sup> However, if confidential information is used as part of the reason you’re charged with violating probation, you can request that the prosecutor disclose (reveal) this information or prove that revealing this information would create a risk of harm to the confidential witness.<sup><a href="#footnote-741" id="footnote-ref-741">[741]</a></sup></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152965"></a>What happens if a very important witness doesn’t show up to the probation revocation hearing, even though he/she was required to attend?</h3>
                <p>If a very important (called “material”) state witness fails to attend a parole revocation hearing, and the hearing cannot fairly proceed without the witness, the court can postpone the hearing or dismiss the case.<sup><a href="#footnote-742" id="footnote-ref-742">[742]</a></sup> </p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152966"></a>Sentencing</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152967"></a>How long can I be sentenced to jail time for a probation revocation?</h3>
                <p>It depends on what your original conviction was for. When your probation is revoked and terminated, the court may—if the original sentence was suspended—now sentence you to jail for the longest period (the maximum sentence) that you could have originally been sentenced for the specific crime you were convicted of committing.<sup><a href="#footnote-743" id="footnote-ref-743">[743]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152968"></a>Could I be sentenced to prison instead of jail for a probation revocation? </h3>
                <p>It’s possible. You could be sentenced to prison time instead of jail time if the crime that you were originally convicted of is one that would have allowed a judge to sentence you to prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-744" id="footnote-ref-744">[744]</a></sup> On the other hand, if the crime you were originally convicted of would <em>not</em> have allowed a judge to sentence you to prison time, then your probation revocation time cannot be sentenced to prison either<strong>.</strong></p>
                <h4 class="textbox">SUMMARY OF SENTENCING FOR PROBATION REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS</h4>
                <p class="textbox">What are the options the court has for sentencing/ punishment if they revoke probation? The judge could:</p>
                <ul class="textbox">Reinstate your probation on the same terms and conditions;Reinstated and modify (change) the terms of your probation to make them more difficult, (including adding fines, community service, or public works service); ORRevoke and terminate your probation—and send you to jail or prison, depending on the commitment offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-745" id="footnote-ref-745">[745]</a></sup></ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152969"></a>If my probation is revoked and terminated, how long will I be sent to prison or jail? </h3>
                <p>It depends. The length of time that you will be sentenced depends on what the judge ordered at the time you were sentenced. When you were initially sentenced to probation, the sentencing judge had the option of either ordering that the Execution of Sentence be Suspended (ESS) or ordering that the Imposition of Sentence be Suspended (ISS). Trying to figure out if the judge imposed ESS or ISS can be tricky. This is a technical area of law; you should be asking your attorney or public defender if you are not sure whether the judge ordered ESS or ISS. </p>
                <p><em>Here are the basics: </em></p>
                <ol class="text">ESS means that the sentence is only executed (meaning, you serve the sentence) if your probation is revoked because you violated your probation conditions. ISS means that your sentence has not yet been determined at the time the judge sentences you to probation. But, if you have ISS and you violate the terms of your probation, and you probation is revoked, then the court, at time that the court finds you in violation of your probation, will sentence you to whatever length sentence (up to the maximum for your specified offense) it deems appropriate.<sup><a href="#footnote-746" id="footnote-ref-746">[746]</a></sup> </ol>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152971"></a>What rights do I have if I am a person with a disability going through probation revocation proceedings? </h3>
                <p class="text">The ADA and California state law protect your rights during probation revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-747" id="footnote-ref-747">[747]</a></sup> In addition, you have a constitutional right to Due Process during a revocation hearing,<sup><a href="#footnote-748" id="footnote-ref-748">[748]</a></sup> this means that the court must give you notice of and ensure that you can participate effectively in the hearing. (See PG. 213 above for more information on your Due Process rights during a probation revocation hearing).</p>
                <p>If you have a disability, you have the following rights during probation revocation proceedings: </p>
                <ol class="text">Reasonable accommodations from Probation staff<sup><a href="#footnote-749" id="footnote-ref-749">[749]</a></sup> Examples of accommodations include: Ensuring access to the hearing room for a person with mobility impairments; providing Braille or taped documents or reading assistance for a vision-impaired person; providing assistance in communicating for a developmentally disabled person; or providing sign language interpretation for a hearing-impaired person. Probation staff must use effective communication and provide accommodations when interacting with people on probation with disabilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-750" id="footnote-ref-750">[750]</a></sup> That means that they must use effective communication and provide accommodation when arresting parolees or modifying conditions of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-751" id="footnote-ref-751">[751]</a></sup>In the courtroom, attorney and court are responsible for meeting your needs during the court processes.<sup><a href="#footnote-752" id="footnote-ref-752">[752]</a></sup>Additional assistance to accommodate your disability so that ensure that you can fully and successfully participate in the revocation proceeding.<sup><a href="#footnote-753" id="footnote-ref-753">[753]</a></sup> Information about your right to receive accommodations and equal treatment, and how this affects your probation programming and requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-754" id="footnote-ref-754">[754]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">IMPORTANT TIPS IN COURT:</h4>
                <ul class="textbox"><strong>Tell the judge about your disability and how it affects your probation</strong>: Remember, the judge has much more power than your probation officer in deciding whether or not to revoke your probation. So if your disability is making it difficult for you to comply with your probation conditions (and if this is the reason for your revocation), you should try to explain this to the judge. Remember to bring documentation (i.e. letters from doctors, medical reports) of your disability to court with you. <strong>Tell the Judge what assistance you need from the Probation Department to accommodate your disability</strong>: You should also explain if you need any additional assistance from the Probation Department.<sup><a href="#footnote-755" id="footnote-ref-755">[755]</a></sup> <strong>Bring Witnesses:</strong> Finally, you can also bring any witnesses (for example, a doctor, therapist, or other service provider) and evidence (such as a letter from your doctor or prescription for medication) to show how your disability affects you.</ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152972"></a>Can I challenge a decision/action by the county superior court?</h3>
                <p>Yes. If you are on probation and would like to challenge a revocation decision or action made by a court, you can file a direct appeal that allows you appeal “any order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the party.”<sup><a href="#footnote-756" id="footnote-ref-756">[756]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="text"><strong>STEP 1:</strong> To file an appeal, you must file a notice of appeal in the superior court within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-757" id="footnote-ref-757">[757]</a></sup> <strong>STEP 2:</strong> When you file a timely notice of appeal, the County Superior will prepare a record of the probation revocation proceedings consisting of all the documents filed in the court and transcripts of the hearings and provide these documents to you, the court, the state (the prosecutor). In a direct appeal, the court must appoint an attorney to represent the you for free if you do not have enough money to pay for one. If you wish to have a court-appointed attorney, you must file a timely notice of appeal within 60 calendar days after the court’s decision. For a list of California County Superior Courts, visit: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm</a>.<strong>STEP 3:</strong> If you do not file a timely notice of appeal or if your case involves information outside the court record, then you may be able to raise the issues in a state court petition for a writ of habeas corpus (see explanation in Appendix K, on PG. 297).</p>
                <p>There are many types of issues that you can raise in a challenge to a revocation proceeding or decision. Claims can be based on violations of state or federal constitutional due process rights, California or federal statutes, or California administrative rules. For example, a person could argue that the revocation hearing is being unreasonably delayed, that he or she was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses at the hearing, or that the revocation decision was not supported by the evidence. Unfortunately, in most cases, the process for raising such challenges will be too slow to provide any relief before you serve the entire revocation term. However, you may still benefit by getting your revocation case re-heard, getting revocations vacated, and/or getting the parole department to subtract the time served for the revocation from your parole “controlling discharge date” (CDD).</p>

                <p class="textbox">We mentioned earlier that each state in the U.S. runs its own criminal justice system—including deciding criminal laws, methods of incarceration, and community supervision. In addition to each state running its own system, the federal government (which oversees all the states) has a separate system to prosecute federal offenses (including things like drug trafficking, human trafficking, immigration, national security, computer fraud, corporate “white-collar” crimes.) In the next two sections of the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, you will learn about the types of correctional supervision in the community that are RUN BY THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT:</p>

                <p class="text">After you are convicted of a federal crime, federal probation is often used as an alternative sentence <em>to prison time</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-758" id="footnote-ref-758">[758]</a></sup></sup> That means that federal “probation” is still considered a sentence in and of itself. For the most part, if you are placed on federal probation, you must report to your assigned probation office <em>and</em> comply with all the rules (terms and conditions) of your federal probation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-759" id="footnote-ref-759">[759]</a></sup></sup> </p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152978"></a>When must I report to my probation officer?</h3>
                <p>You must report to your probation officer within 72 hours (3 days), or sooner if a judge or U.S. Probation Officer orders you to.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-760" id="footnote-ref-760">[760]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>Read the written statement given to you by U.S. Probation for information on where, when, and to whom you should report.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-761" id="footnote-ref-761">[761]</a></sup></sup> If you cannot remember where you were supposed to report or have lost your written statement, you should report to the nearest U.S. Probation office and they will be able to help you.<sup><a href="#footnote-762" id="footnote-ref-762">[762]</a></sup> To find the U.S. Probation office closest to you:</p>
                <ol class="text">Go to the U.S. Courts’ website here: <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Court_Locator/CourtLocatorSearch.aspx">http://www.uscourts.gov/Court_Locator/CourtLocatorSearch.aspx</a> Fill in your city, state, and zip code.Under the “Court Type” drop-down menu, choose “Probation Offices”A list of offices nearest you will appear. If you click the link for “Details” on any one of those listings, it will take you to a new web page with the street address, phone number for the U.S. Probation office, and an interactive map of the location.</ol>
                <p>Sometimes the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP)—which oversees the federal prison system across the country—will release you to a transitional house (a “halfway house”), before you’ve reached your actual release date—usually 6 months ahead of time. </p>
                <p class="text">Before you leave federal prison, the prison staff will give you a “Notice of Release and Arrival” (Form BP-S714.056), which will clearly state the exact amount of time you are allowed for transportation from the prison to the transitional house. Once at the transitional house, you might be subject to a lockdown period (for example, a 72-hour lockdown period)—meaning you cannot leave for those days.</p>
                <p>After being released from a transitional house, Federal Probation staff will give you another <em>Notice of Release and Arrival</em> (Form BP-S714.056). For some people on federal probation, that is the moment that the 72-hour clock for checking in with your Probation Officer begins. That form will also clearly state your home confinement date. The transitional house you are leasing in may have requirements you first have to meet to their satisfaction before you will be released to home confinement—usually on an ankle monitor until the 6 months are up.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448152979"></a>Length of Federal Probation</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152980"></a><a id="PP_Federalprobationstimelimits"></a>How long is my supervision under federal probation?</h3>
                <p>The maximum term of probation that can be imposed depends on the type of conviction offense:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-763" id="footnote-ref-763">[763]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>FELONY CONVICTION: Minimum 1 year to maximum 5 years; <em>or</em>MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION: Maximum 5 years.INFRACTION: Maximum 1 year.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-764" id="footnote-ref-764">[764]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>
                <p>Therefore, to know the range of time you could be sentenced to federal probation, you will need to know if you were convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, or infraction. If you aren’t sure, ask your federal public defender or your probation officer.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152981"></a>Can I get off of federal probation early?</h3>
                <p><em>Possibly</em>. You can ask for early release from federal probation from the judge who originally sentenced you. </p>
                <ol class="text">For a <em>misdemeanor conviction</em> or an <em>infraction</em>, you can file a petition and ask the judge to terminate your federal probation at any time. For a <em>felony conviction</em>, you can file a petition and ask the judge to terminate your federal probation after one year.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-765" id="footnote-ref-765">[765]</a></sup></sup> Talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about this request first, because he or she can help you ask the judge for this.</ol>
                <p>The court has the power to decide whether or not to let you off probation early. In most cases, judges will deny requests to be let off probation early. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try, especially if you’ve done really well on your probation. And remember, it is really helpful if your Probation Officer supports your request. </p>
                <p><em>You have the best shot of being let off of federal probation EARLY if:</em></p>
                <ol class="text">You have completed 2/3 of your probation term (or at the very least, you are ½ way through), You have had no violations, You have complied with all the terms of your probation, You have paid all restitution and fines, and Your probation officer agrees that you should be let off early<sup><a href="#footnote-766" id="footnote-ref-766">[766]</a></sup></ol>
                <h5 class="question">What factors might the judge consider in my request?</h5>
                <p class="answer">It depends on the judge. Ultimately, the decision to end your federal probation early is up to the judge who originally sentenced you. To get off of federal probation early, you must show the judge that you have earned it through good conduct, and it must be in the interest of justice.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-767" id="footnote-ref-767">[767]</a></sup></sup> See Appendix EE, PG. 342 for more information.</p>
                <p>Here is the full list of factors that the judge <em>may </em>consider when deciding whether to let you off probation early:</p>
                <ol class="text">Whether or not your Probation Officer or the Prosecutor support your request;The nature and seriousness of the crime you were convicted of;Your criminal history and/or mental illness history;Whether the judge believes you are a threat to the public;Whether the judge believes you have been sufficiently punished;Whether you have completed any substance abuse treatment or rehabilitation programs;How your sentence compares to the federal sentencing guidelines recommended sentence;U.S. Sentencing Commission policy statements;<sup><a href="#footnote-768" id="footnote-ref-768">[768]</a></sup>Whether you’ve paid restitution to the victims.<sup><a href="#footnote-769" id="footnote-ref-769">[769]</a></sup></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152982"></a>Could my time on federal probation be extended beyond the original sentence?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but only if you were not originally given the maximum term on federal probation that would be allowed under law. The judge may extend your probation at any time before the end of your sentence, but must give you a hearing before doing so. At that court hearing, the judge can make your probation term longer if he or she did not originally give you the maximum authorized term.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-770" id="footnote-ref-770">[770]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>A judge may extend your time on federal probation instead of sending you to jail if he or she finds you violated your conditions of probation (see PG. 222 which discusses conditions of federal probation). The maximum amount of time you’ll spend on federal probation supervision depends on whether you were convicted of a felony, misdemeanor, or infraction. Look at PG. 221 to figure out the maximum amount of time you could spend on federal probation.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448152983"></a>Condit<a id="federalprobationconditions"></a>ions of Federal Probation</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152984"></a>What are conditions of federal probation, and why are they important?</h3>
                <p>Your conditions of federal probation are the rules set by the judge that you must follow if you want to remain in the community under supervision, and not be sent back to prison. These are called “release conditions”—they tell you what you can and can’t do in the community. These conditions are broken down into two types: (1) mandatory conditions and (2) discretionary conditions. </p>
                <p><strong><em>Examples include:</em></strong></p>
                <ol class="text">Not being able to own/store guns or other weapons;No contact with victims or witnesses; restrict your association with certain people or groups;Restricted travel;Curfews;Community service;Electronic monitoring;Employment requirements;Mental health treatment;Substance abuse treatment.</ol>
                <p>It is important for you to know what conditions <em>you must follow</em> on federal probation so that you don’t get into trouble or sent to prison for violating those rules. </p>
                <p>Also: be sure to talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about how to get connected to any needed services or resources offered in your community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-771" id="footnote-ref-771">[771]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152985"></a>Where can I find a written statement of my conditions of federal probation?</h3>
                <p>The judge must direct the probation officer to provide you with a written statement that explains all the conditions you must follow, and is clear and specific enough to guide your conduct under supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-772" id="footnote-ref-772">[772]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>The conditions of supervision are also listed on the “Judgment in a Criminal Case” produced by the court after your sentencing hearing. Ask your attorney or the Clerk of the Court where you were sentenced for a copy of this document so that you can be sure of your obligations to the Court. Most judges will not excuse your failure to comply with the conditions of supervision simply because you did not receive a copy of the conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-773" id="footnote-ref-773">[773]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152986"></a>How often do I have to see my probation officer if I am on federal probation?</h3>
                <p>It depends. How often you must report to your probation officer varies widely based on the individual “supervision plan” developed for you by your probation officer.<sup><a href="#footnote-774" id="footnote-ref-774">[774]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>Some supervision plans require weekly meetings and even more frequent phone contact; for others, occasional or monthly contact is sufficient. Meetings may take place at the probation office, your home, or your workplace.<sup><a href="#footnote-775" id="footnote-ref-775">[775]</a></sup> Probation officers sometimes make “surprise” visits. For this reason, it is important that you always inform your probation officer of any changes to your work schedule. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152987"></a>What is the difference between mandatory &amp; discretionary conditions?</h3>
                <p>Federal law governs the mandatory conditions of federal probation (the law breaks it down into a list of mandatory conditions (required) and discretionary conditions (not required).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-776" id="footnote-ref-776">[776]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">Mandatory conditions are the rules that judges <em>must</em> impose. Discretionary conditions are the rules that judges <em>can, but do not have to,</em> impose. </ol>
                <p>If a judge wants to impose a discretionary condition, he or she MUST find that the condition <em>reasonably relates</em> to sentencing factors,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-777" id="footnote-ref-777">[777]</a></sup></sup> and is <em>reasonably necess</em>ary for the purposes of supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-778" id="footnote-ref-778">[778]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>The only difference to note is that intermittent confinement may be imposed as a condition of probation during the first year of federal probation. Intermittent confinement means temporarily going into Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody for a night, a weekend (or possibly for a longer period of time).<sup><a href="#footnote-779" id="footnote-ref-779">[779]</a></sup> </p>
                <a id="_Toc448152988"></a>
                <h3>Wha<a id="fedeeralprobationSTANDARDconditions"></a>t are the mandatory conditions on federal probation?</h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">POSSIBLE EXCEPTION TO THE BAN ON SUBSTANCE USE</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The Court can completely remove or suspend this condition if your pre-sentence report (or other reliable sentencing information) indicated a low risk of future substance abuse.</p>
                <p class="text">The following conditions are mandatory and apply to EVERYONE on Federal Probation. (Note: These also apply to everyone on Supervised Release, see PG. 232.)</p>
                <ol class="text">You cannot commit another federal, state, or local crime during the entire length of your federal probation. The court must make this condition known and clear to you.You cannot unlawfully use a controlled substance. You must submit to one drug test within 15 days of release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court).Consequences for a confirmed positive drug test include:Possible prison time, andCourt-ordered participation in a substance abuse treatment program (unless your current or past participation in such a program warrants an exception)<sup><a href="#footnote-780" id="footnote-ref-780">[780]</a></sup>You must cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample.<sup><a href="#footnote-781" id="footnote-ref-781">[781]</a></sup> You may be placed in prison for up to one year or fined up to $100,000 if you fail to cooperate with a DNA sample. You must notify your U.S. probation officer if there is any significant change in your income or economic circumstances, which would impact how much you can pay towards any unpaid restitution, fines, or special assessments.<sup><a href="#footnote-782" id="footnote-ref-782">[782]</a></sup> Even those receiving SSI/SSDI “Disability” benefits will be asked to pay. If you are low-income, you should communicate with your probation officer about how you might be able to arrange payments you can afford.</ol>

                <p class="text">For a discretionary condition to be lawful, the following must be true:It must be “reasonably related” to the nature and circumstances of the offense, your personal history and characteristics, the need to protect the public from you committing future crimes, and the need to provide you educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; ANDIt cannot deprive you of liberty (meaning, your ability to live your life freely without excessive restrictions) any more than “reasonably necessary” to deter future crimes, protect the public, and for the purpose of providing you with training and treatment.<sup><a href="#footnote-788" id="footnote-ref-788">[788]</a></sup>A judge may order discretionary conditions on your federal probation—but only if it meets this two-part legal standard.Furthermore, <em>discretionary conditions</em> of federal probation can be thought of in two categories—(1) “standard conditions,” which are imposed in almost every person’s case (see note directly below), and (2) other discretionary conditions that may be added to you in particular (see the next question).</p>
                <p><strong>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT STANDARD CONDITIONS: </strong></p>
                <p class="text">The list of “Standard Conditions” below—while technically discretionary (not required)— will be added by the judge in <em>almost every case</em> of federal probation (the same is true for Supervised Release, see PG. 232). These “standard conditions” will be IN ADDITION TO the general conditions of federal probation discussed on PG. 224 above.<sup><a href="#footnote-789" id="footnote-ref-789">[789]</a></sup> For a full list, please see PG. 337. If you are on federal probation that means you will likely have to follow all of these rules.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152991"></a>What rules must the judge follow when ordering discretionary conditions on my federal probation?</h3>
                <p>To add a discretionary condition to your federal probation, the judge must find that that the conditions are reasonably related to the following factors:</p>
                <ol class="text">The nature and circumstances of the offense;Your personal history and characteristics;Reflecting the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense;Adequately deterring future criminal conduct;Protecting the public from further crimes committed by you; and/orProviding you with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.<sup><a href="#footnote-790" id="footnote-ref-790">[790]</a></sup>Furthermore, if the additional discretionary conditions <em>deprive you of liberty or property</em>, the judge must find that the conditions are reasonably necessary to:Reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;Adequately deter future criminal conduct;Protect the public from further crimes committed by you; and/orProvide you with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.<sup><a href="#footnote-791" id="footnote-ref-791">[791]</a></sup></ol>

                <p>POSSIBILITY #1: </p>
                <p>If you are moving to a new residence within your current district, follow these steps:</p>
                <h4 class="step">Notify your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move within your current U.S. Probation District—even if it’s across the street.Your Probation Officer will investigate the new address—so long as it is located in the same U.S. Probation District. As part of that investigation, your Probation Officer will:</h4>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.<sup><a href="#footnote-798" id="footnote-ref-798">[798]</a></sup>Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p>
                <p>POSSIBILITY #2:</p>
                <p>If you are moving to a new residence outside of your current U.S. Probation District, it’s suggested that you follow these steps:</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1: </strong>Before you ask for a formal transfer to a new district—which can be a longer, more challenging process—ask your probation officer for what is called “courtesy supervision” by another district. This technically keeps your case in the original district, but allows you to live in and travel to the district of your choice. Your probation officer AND the probation officer of the other district have to agree. After doing this, it is much easier to transfer to the courtesy district than to just transfer from one district to another without “courtesy supervision” being set up first.</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: </strong>If “courtesy supervision” is denied or doesn’t work out, you can still request a formal transfer. Tell your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move to a new address in a different U.S. Probation District.</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: </strong>Your Probation Officer must submit a “Transfer Investigation” to the new district. The Transfer Investigation generally takes 30 days or longer, since both your current district and the new district must investigate your new proposed address and approve the transfer. As part of the “Transfer Investigation,” a Probation Officer in the receiving District will:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 4: </strong>The receiving District must approve or deny the transfer after conducting the “Transfer Investigation.” The receiving district can deny your request to transfer/move for any reason. The sending district where you are currently supervised must wait for a response before it can act to transfer your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-799" id="footnote-ref-799">[799]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE! Some districts have hard and fast rules about certain offenses—e.g., they won’t accept people with sex offenses, or the receiving district will require a more onerous investigation of that person.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152997"></a>I am on federal probation and want to move/transfer to a new state. How can I do that?</h3>
                <p>To transfer districts, it’s best to first discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of BOTH your current probation officer AND a probation officer from the new district. Only those transfers that follow the U.S. Parole Commission’s instructions can be approved.<sup><a href="#footnote-800" id="footnote-ref-800">[800]</a></sup></p>
                <p>Go to PG. 261 to learn how to transfer states. An Interstate Compact governs all transfers between states, and applies to all types of supervision (state parole, county probation and other county-level forms of supervision, federal probation, supervised release, and federal parole).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152998"></a>What are some <em>positive factors</em> that could help my request to move/ transfer be approved?</h3>
                <p>Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. </p>
                <p>The following are factors that will likely work in your favor if you can show these to your Probation Officer:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Reliable job offer in new area;Proven family and community ties;Other positive connections to the new area;Reasonable plan for living in the new area (e.g., income, social and family support, etc.);The new address was your legal residence prior to incarceration, and had nothing to do with your criminal offense;You have nowhere else to go and would be homeless if you don’t move; andThe move appears to be in your best interest for other reasons not listed above.</strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152999"></a>What are some <em>negative factors</em> that could hurt the chances of my request to move/ transfer from being approved?</h3>
                <p>Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. </p>
                <p>The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>No job offer in new area;No or weak family and community ties in the new area;Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;The new address where you want to move is unsafe;Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; andThe residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.</strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153000"></a>I am on federal probation or supervised release. Is it possible to move while a transfer investigation is still pending?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. Sometimes a U.S. Probation Officer will give someone permission to move while an investigation is pending. For example, you may be allowed to move before an official approval of your transfer request if:</p>
                <div class="normal2">An eviction is forcing you out of your home and you have nowhere else to live but at the new address in your current district or a different district;You have a job offer that requires you to start on a specific date;Another emergency reason that requires you to move.</div>
                <h4 class="textbox">IF YOUR NEED TO MOVE IS URGENT:</h4>
                <div class="normal2">You should inform your Probation Officer and request a travel permit while the “Transfer Investigation” and approval are still pending. But please be aware, if the new district completes its “Transfer Investigation” and denies the transfer request <em>for any reason</em>, you would be required to move back to the original sending district.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-801" id="footnote-ref-801">[801]</a></sup></sup> If you do not move back, you will be violating the Court’s Order to follow the directions of the Probation Officer. If the court finds you were not following the directions of your Probation Officer, it can revoke your supervision and send you to prison.</div>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153001"></a>Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor’s approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-802" id="footnote-ref-802">[802]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153002"></a>I am on federal probation, and I’m trying to move in with someone who lives in government-assisted housing (like public housing, section 8, or a voucher program), can I still move in?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. If the family member or person you want to move in with lives in subsidized housing, there might be federal, state, or local laws that restrict someone on federal probation or Supervised Release from moving into the residence. It may depend on what your conviction was for. To avoid putting that person’s government- assisted housing subsidy at risk, refer to the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 351, to learn more about how your criminal record or supervision status might affect where you can live.</p>

                <h3>What is supervised release? </h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">SENTENCING REFORM ACT </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Some historical background: In 1984, as part of the Sentencing Reform Act (“SRA”) that created the federal sentencing guidelines system, Congress got rid of federal parole and created Supervised Release. </p>
                <p class="text">Supervised release is overseen by Federal District Courts with the assistance of federal probation officers.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-804" id="footnote-ref-804">[804]</a></sup></sup> The judge can sentence you to a term of Supervised Release <em>in addition to a sentence of imprisonment</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-805" id="footnote-ref-805">[805]</a></sup></sup> In other words, a term of Supervised Release does not replace any time you are sentenced to prison; rather, a judge orders Supervised Release in addition to any term in prison you may serve.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-806" id="footnote-ref-806">[806]</a></sup></sup> In some cases, the judge that sentences you is actually <em>required by law</em> to impose a term of Supervised Release in addition to a prison term.<sup><a href="#footnote-807" id="footnote-ref-807">[807]</a></sup>It’s common today for a federal sentence to include a period of time in prison, followed by a period of time in the community on Supervised Release.</p>
                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintSupervised Release vs. Federal Probation:<br/>What’s the difference between the two?</h4>
                <p class="textbox">Federal Probation: Federal probation is a substitute for incarceration, meaning that probation is ordered <em>instead of</em> incarceration. Supervised release: Supervised release is ordered <em>in addition to</em> incarceration. This means that after you are released from prison, you may be placed on supervised release. Note that the same terms and conditions generally apply to both people on federal probation and on supervised release. </p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153008"></a>After Release: What to Expect in Your First Days Out on Supervised Release</h1>
                <p class="text">Generally, you must report to your probation officer within 72 hours (3 days) of release, or sooner if a judge or a U.S. Probation Officer orders you to do so.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-808" id="footnote-ref-808">[808]</a></sup></sup> IMPORTANT: Read the written statement given to you by U.S. Probation for information on where, when, and to whom you should report.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-809" id="footnote-ref-809">[809]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153009"></a>Length of Supervised Release</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153010"></a>How long is my supervision under supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="text">Supervised Release can be up to 5 years, with a few exceptions discussed below on PG. 233.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-810" id="footnote-ref-810">[810]</a></sup></sup> The length of the term of your Supervised Release is determined by the “Class” of crime for which you were convicted.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-811" id="footnote-ref-811">[811]</a></sup></sup> To figure out what the range of time your will be sentenced to Supervised Release, you should find out which “Class” of crime you were convicted of (for example, a Class A Felony, Class B Felony, Class A Misdemeanor, etc.). See the chart in the Appendix HH, PG. 347, for more information. IMPORTANT EXC<a id="srexceptions"></a>EPTIONS:</p>
                <p class="textbox">Despite the lengths of Supervised Release listed above, the term length may be up to life if you committed:</p>
                <ul class="textbox">An offense listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B), which resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person; ORA sex offense— for these commitment offenses, the maximum term of supervised release as allowed by statute is recommended.</ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153011"></a>Can I get off supervised release early?</h3>
                <p class="text"><em>Possibly.</em> You can ask for an early termination of supervised release from the judge who originally sentenced you. You are eligible to be released early after one year of supervised release.<sup><a href="#footnote-812" id="footnote-ref-812">[812]</a></sup> Talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about this request first, because he or she can help you ask the judge for this.The court has the power to decide whether or not to let you off supervised release early. In most cases, judges will deny requests to be let off supervised release early. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try, especially if you’ve done really well on your supervised release. And remember, it is really helpful if your Probation Officer supports your request. </p>
                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint</h4>
                <p class="textbox">You have the best shot of being let of supervised release early if:</p>
                <ul class="textbox">You have completed 2/3 of your supervised release term (or at the very least ½ way through),You have had no violations, You have complied with all the terms of your supervised release, You have paid all restitution and fines, and Your probation officer agrees that you should be let off early<sup><a href="#footnote-813" id="footnote-ref-813">[813]</a></sup></ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153012"></a>What factors can the judge consider?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends on the judge. Ultimately, the decision to end your supervised release early is up to the judge who originally sentenced you. To get off of supervised release early, you must show the judge that you have earned it through good conduct, and it must be in the interests of justice.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-814" id="footnote-ref-814">[814]</a></sup></sup>Here is the full list of factors that the judge <em>may </em>consider when deciding whether to let you off supervised release early:</p>
                <ol class="text">Whether or not your Probation Officer or the Prosecutor support your request;The nature and seriousness of the crime you were convicted of;Your criminal history and/or mental illness history;Whether the judge believes you are a threat to the public;Whether the judge believes you have been sufficiently punished;Whether you have completed any substance abuse treatment or rehabilitation programs;How your sentence compares to the federal sentencing guidelines recommended sentence;U.S. Sentencing Commission policy statements;<sup><a href="#footnote-815" id="footnote-ref-815">[815]</a></sup>Whether you’ve paid restitution to the victims.<sup><a href="#footnote-816" id="footnote-ref-816">[816]</a></sup></ol>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153014"></a>Wha<a id="supervisedreleseconditions"></a>t are conditions of supervised release, and why are they important?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your conditions of Supervised Release are rules set by the judge that you must follow if you want to remain in the community under supervision and not end up back in prison. These are called “release conditions”—and tell you what you can and can’t do in the community. EXAMPLE of release conditions include:</p>
                <ol class="text">Not having guns or other weapons;No contact with victims or witnesses; Restrictions on your association with certain people or groups; Restrictions on your travel; or A curfew; Community service; Electronic monitoring; Employment requirements; Mental health treatment, or Substance abuse treatment. </ol>
                <p class="text">It is important for you to know what conditions <em>you must follow</em> on Supervised Release so that you don’t get into trouble or sent back to prison for violating those rules. Also, be sure to talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about how to get connected to any needed services or resources offered in your community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-817" id="footnote-ref-817">[817]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153015"></a>What is the difference between mandatory &amp; discretionary conditions of supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="text">Federal law governs the mandatory conditions of Supervised Release (the law breaks it down by a list of mandatory conditions (required) and discretionary conditions (not required).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-818" id="footnote-ref-818">[818]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153016"></a>Where can I find a written statement of my conditions of supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="text">The court must direct the probation officer to provide you with a written statement that explains all the conditions you must follow, and is clear and specific enough to guide your conduct under supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-819" id="footnote-ref-819">[819]</a></sup> The conditions of supervision are also listed on the Judgment in a Criminal Case produced by the Court after your sentencing hearing. Ask your attorney or the Clerk of the Court for a copy of this document so that you can be sure of your obligations to the Court. Most Judges will not excuse your failure to comply with the conditions of supervision simply because you did not receive a copy of the conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-820" id="footnote-ref-820">[820]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153017"></a>How often do I have to see my probation officer if I am on supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. How often you must report to your probation officer varies widely based on the individual “supervision plan” developed for you by your probation officer.<sup><a href="#footnote-821" id="footnote-ref-821">[821]</a></sup> Some supervision plans require weekly meetings and even more frequent phone contact; for others, occasional or monthly contact is sufficient. Meetings may take place at the probation office, your home, or your workplace.<sup><a href="#footnote-822" id="footnote-ref-822">[822]</a></sup> Probation officers sometimes make “surprise” visits. For this reason, it is important that you always inform your probation officer of any changes to your work schedule.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153018"></a>What are the mandatory conditions that apply to me and everyone else on superVISed release?</h3>
                <p class="text">The following conditions are mandatory and apply to EVERYONE on Supervised Release.<sup><a href="#footnote-823" id="footnote-ref-823">[823]</a></sup> (Note: These also apply to everyone on Federal Probation, see PG. 224).</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You cannot commit another federal, state, or local crime during the entire length of your Supervised Release. The court must make this condition known and clear to you.You cannot unlawfully use a controlled substance. You must submit to one drug test within 15 days of release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court).Consequences for a confirmed positive drug test include:Possible prison time, andCourt-ordered participation in a substance abuse treatment program (unless your current or past participation in such a program warrants an exception)<sup><a href="#footnote-824" id="footnote-ref-824">[824]</a></sup>You must cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample.<sup><a href="#footnote-825" id="footnote-ref-825">[825]</a></sup> You may be placed in prison for up to one year or fined up to $100,000 if you fail to cooperate with a DNA sample.

                <p class="text">If the above legal standards are met (refer to the last two questions), the judge may order discretionary conditions on your Supervised Release. These can be thought of in two categories—<em>standard conditions</em>, which are imposed in almost every case (see Appendix CC, PG. 337), and other <em>discretionary conditions</em> that may be added (see Appendix DD, PG. 234).STANDARD CONDITIONS— The list of “Standard Conditions”—while technically discretionary (not required)— are added by the judge in almost every case of Supervised Release (and federal probation), as recommended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the agency that oversees federal sentencing guidelines.<sup><a href="#footnote-838" id="footnote-ref-838">[838]</a></sup>You will likely be ordered to follow most if not all of the following rules (conditions), or something very similar to these:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-839" id="footnote-ref-839">[839]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">You cannot leave the limits of your judicial district (meaning the area that the court has jurisdiction—i.e. the “Southern District of California”) without written permission from the court or your probation officer.You must file a written report with your probation officer within the first 5 days of each month, or as directed by your probation officer.You must truthfully answer any questions and follow any instructions that your probation officer asks of you.You must meet your family responsibilities, primarily paying any court-ordered child support or support for the parent with whom your child is living.You must work regularly at a lawful occupation, unless your U.S. probation officer excuses you for school, training, or other reasons the officer finds acceptable.You must notify your probation officer at least 10 days before you change your address (some officers will require more or less notice, so check your conditions).You cannot drink alcoholic beverages to excess. You cannot use or distribute illegal drugs, or frequent places where others use or distribute drugs.You cannot associate with people engaged in criminal activity. (This means you cannot hang out with or spend time with people who are committing crimes.) You cannot associate with anyone convicted of a felony unless your U.S. probation officer gives you permission to do so. (Again, this means that unless your probation officer says differently, you are not allowed to hang out with or spend time with someone who has been convicted of a felony. Just spending time with someone who has been convicted of a felony can be considered a violation of your probation, even if you were not doing anything else wrong.) You must let your probation officer to visit you any time at home or elsewhere.You must let your probation officer to take any contraband that he or she finds in plain view around you.You must get in touch with your U.S. probation officer within 3 days (72 hours) if you’re arrested or questioned by law enforcement (again, some officers will require you to report faster, so check your conditions).You cannot serve as an informant to law enforcement without court permission.As directed by your U.S. probation officer, you must notify other people about any risks that your criminal record, personal history or characteristics might pose; and you must allow your U.S. probation officer to notify people of any risks posed by your criminal record, personal history or characteristics.You must pay any court-ordered “special assessment” and fines, and follow any court-ordered payment plan set up for you. You must notify your U.S. probation officer if there is any significant change in your income or economic circumstances which would impact how much you can pay towards any unpaid restitution, fines, or special assessments (NOTE: this is a mandatory condition for people on federal probation, and a recommended “standard condition” for people on Supervised Release).</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153023"></a>What additional discretionary conditions may I have to follow on supervised release? </h3>
                <p class="text">If the above legal standards are met (refer to PG. 226), the judge may order additional discretionary conditions on your Supervised Release. As discussed, the Standard Conditions listed on PG. 337 above are almost always added. For a full list of discretionary conditions that may be added see Appendix DD, PG. 339):</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153024"></a>Can my conditions of supervised release be changed?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. A judge may change, reduce, or increase your conditions before your Supervised Release term ends.<sup><a href="#footnote-840" id="footnote-ref-840">[840]</a></sup> A probation officer can also change your conditions of Supervised Release. Changes in conditions (called “modifications”) usually happen because you got in trouble with your probation officer (for example, you tested dirty on a drug test), or you didn’t follow a condition of your Supervised Release. In this type of situation, the probation officer will usually ask a judge to change your conditions, often with the consent of your attorney, to get an order for you to do something (for example, to get an order that you go into in-patient, residential substance abuse treatment). PRACTICE TIP—AN ATTORNEY CAN HELP YOU: It’s been suggested that it is sometimes easier to work out any changes to your conditions of supervised release directly with your probation officer, rather than go before a judge. To protect yourself in this type of situation, it is best to “invoke your right to counsel”—meaning ask for an attorney to represent you—and then you can communicate with your attorney who will work something out with the probation officer or represent you before the judge if the issue ends up going back to court.<sup><a href="#footnote-841" id="footnote-ref-841">[841]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Sometimes a U.S. probation officer will ask you to waive (give up) your right to an attorney and submit to a change of your conditions of Supervised Release (called a “modification”).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-842" id="footnote-ref-842">[842]</a></sup></strong> You may be asked (directly or indirectly) to give up your right to an attorney. You should NOT give up this right. You should “invoke your right to counsel instead,” and ask for an attorney. If you do not agree to changes in the conditions of your Supervised Release, then any changes will require the same justification as conditions imposed during the original sentencing hearing.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-843" id="footnote-ref-843">[843]</a></sup></strong></p>

                <p class="text">Within 14 days of your sentencing hearing, you must file a Notice of Appeal with the Clerk of the Court where you were convicted.<sup><a href="#footnote-844" id="footnote-ref-844">[844]</a></sup> Once this occurs, you should contact the Federal Public Defender’s Office in your federal judicial district. .

                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="PP_Fed_SR_Transfer"></a><a id="_Toc448153026"></a>Transfer Locations on Supervised Release</h1>
                <p><em>The same rules and procedures for transferring and moving residences apply to both federal probation and Supervised Release (federal probation transfers discussed earlier on PG. 227).</em></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153027"></a>I am on federal probation or supervised release, and I want to move. How can I do that? </h3>
                <p class="text">The process depends on whether you are asking to move to a new residence <em>within the same district</em> OR to a new residence <em>in a different district</em>. A district is the geographic area that a district federal court has power to make decisions over—for example, California has four federal districts: Southern District, Northern District, Central District, and Eastern District. </p>
                <p><strong>In a nutshell, it’s easier to move within the same district than to move to a new one. The steps below outline both possibilities:</strong></p>
                <p>POSSIBILITY #1: If you are moving to a new residence within your current district, follow these steps:</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1: Notify your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move within your current U.S. Probation District—even if it’s across the street.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: Your Probation Officer will investigate the new address—so long as it is located in the same U.S. Probation District. As part of that investigation, your Probation Officer will:</strong></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.<sup><a href="#footnote-849" id="footnote-ref-849">[849]</a></sup>Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p>
                <p>POSSIBILITY #2: If you are moving to a new residence outside of your current U.S. Probation District, follow these steps:</p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1: HELPFUL HINT!!!—Before you ask for a formal transfer to a new district—which can be a longer, more challenging process—ask your probation officer for what is called “courtesy supervision” by another district. This technically keeps your case in the original district, but allows you to live in and travel to the district of your choice. Your probation officer AND the probation officer of the other district have to agree. After doing this, it is much easier to transfer to the courtesy district than to just transfer from one district to another without “courtesy supervision” being set up first.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: If “courtesy supervision” is denied or doesn’t work out, you can still request a formal transfer. Tell your Probation Officer that you want to change your address, and submit that address and the contact information for anyone else living at that address. You must get permission from your Probation Officer to move to a new address in a different U.S. Probation District.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: Your Probation Officer must submit a “Transfer Investigation” to the new district. The Transfer Investigation generally takes 30 days or longer, since both your current district and the new district must investigate your new proposed address and approve the transfer. As part of the “Transfer Investigation,” a Probation Officer in the receiving District will:</strong></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Make sure the new address actually exists;Make sure that other people living at the new address are willing and able to have you in their home;Run a background check on everyone living at the new address;PLEASE NOTE: Since it is a standard condition for all people on Federal Probation or Supervised Release to avoid associating with anyone else who has a felony conviction, your request to move/transfer to live with someone who has been convicted of a felony will likely be denied.Make sure that everyone at the new address knows about and agrees to the “Search Condition” of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release.Make sure there are no weapons at the new address.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 4: The receiving district must approve or deny the transfer after completing the “Transfer Investigation.” The receiving district can deny your request to transfer for any reason. The sending district where you are currently supervised must wait for a response before it can transfer your supervision.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-850" id="footnote-ref-850">[850]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE! Some districts have hard and fast rules about certain offenses—e.g., they won’t accept people with sex offenses, or the receiving district will require a more onerous investigation of that person.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153028"></a>I am on supervised release and want to move/transfer to a new state. How can I do that?</h3>
                <p class="text">To transfer districts, you need to discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of both your probation officer from the current district AND a probation officer from the new district. You can only transfer if it doesn’t go against the instructions from the U.S. Parole Commission.<sup><a href="#footnote-851" id="footnote-ref-851">[851]</a></sup> Go to PG. 261 to learn how to transfer states. An Interstate Compact governs all transfers between states, and applies to all types of supervision (state parole, county probation and other county-level forms of supervision, federal probation, supervised release, and federal parole).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153029"></a>What are some <em>positive factors</em> that could help my request to move/ transfer be approved?</h3>
                <p class="text">Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. The following are factors that will likely work in your favor if you can show these to your Probation Officer:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Reliable job offer in new area;Proven family and community ties;Other positive connections to the new area;Reasonable plan for living in the new area (e.g., income, social and family support, etc.);The new address was your legal residence prior to incarceration, and had nothing to do with your criminal offense;You have nowhere else to go and would be homeless if you don’t move; andThe move appears to be in your best interest for other reasons not listed above.</strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153030"></a>What are some <em>negative factors</em> that could hurt the chances of my request to move/ transfer from being approved?</h3>
                <p class="text">Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:</p>
                <ol class="text">No job offer in new area;No or weak family and community ties in the new area;Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;The new address where you want to move is unsafe;Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; andThe residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153031"></a>I am on federal probation or supervised release. Is it possible to move while a transfer investigation is still pending?</h3>
                <div class="normal2">Maybe. Sometimes a U.S. Probation Officer will give someone permission to move while an investigation is pending. For example, you may be allowed to move before an official approval of your transfer request if:An eviction is forcing you out of your home and you have nowhere else to live but at the new address in your current district or a different district;You have a job offer that requires you to start on a specific date;Another emergency reason that requires you to move.</div>
                <h4 class="textbox">IF YOUR NEED TO MOVE IS URGENT:</h4>
                <div class="normal2">You should inform your Probation Officer and request a travel permit while the “Transfer Investigation” and approval are still pending. But please be aware, if the new district completes its “Transfer Investigation” and denies the transfer request for any reason, you would be required to move back to the original sending district.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-852" id="footnote-ref-852">[852]</a></sup></sup> If you do not move back, you will be violating the Court’s Order to follow the directions of the Probation Officer. If the court finds you were not following the directions of your Probation Officer, it can revoke your supervision and send you to prison.</div>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153032"></a>Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor’s approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-853" id="footnote-ref-853">[853]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153033"></a>I am on supervised release, and I’m trying to move in with someone I know. If my family member or the person who I want to move in with lives in government-assisted housing (like public housing, section 8, or a voucher program), can I still move in?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. If the family member or person you want to move in with lives in subsidized housing, there might be federal, state, or local laws that restrict someone on federal probation or Supervised Release from moving into the residence. It may depend on what your conviction was for. To avoid putting that person’s government- assisted housing subsidy at risk, refer to the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 351, to learn more about how your criminal record or supervision status might affect where you can live.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153035"></a>What is a violation of my federal probation or supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="text">It is a violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release (SR) if you break any law or disobey any condition of your post-release supervision. Read about conditions of Federal Probation (PG. 222) and Supervised Release (PG. 234) above.If your probation officer thinks you have broken one of your conditions of supervision, you may be charged with a violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-855" id="footnote-ref-855">[855]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If the judge finds that you have violated one of your conditions of supervision, you could go to prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-856" id="footnote-ref-856">[856]</a></sup> If you are having trouble with your Probation officer, or if you think you are in danger of being violated, you should call your attorney. If you have retained a private attorney, you should call him or her. If you don’t have a private attorney, you should call the Federal Public Defender in you District. Often an attorney can help you resolve a supervision problem before there is a formal violation charge.<sup><a href="#footnote-857" id="footnote-ref-857">[857]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153036"></a>Can my U.S. probation officer send me back to prison?</h3>
                <p class="text">No, your probation officer cannot send you back to prison, but it is part of the officer’s job to tell the court about a violation of your conditions. The judge at court, however, usually CAN send you back to prison.</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>MINOR VIOLATIONS:</strong> Typically, if your probation officer learns of a minor violation of a condition, or believes that a violation is likely to happen, the officer will discuss with you how to avoid a more serious problem. Alternatively, the probation officer might ask the judge to modify your conditions of Federal Probation or Supervised Release. <strong>SERIOUS or REPEATED VIOLATIONS:</strong> After a serious violation or repeated violations, your probation officer may tell a judge about these violations and request revocation of your Federal Probation/Supervised Release. If this happens, you have the right to a revocation hearing, at which the judge may decide to revoke your Federal Probation/Supervised Release and send you back to prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-858" id="footnote-ref-858">[858]</a></sup> </ol>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153038"></a>When is revocation of federal probation or supervised release mandatory?</h3>
                <p><strong>For both Federal Probation and Supervised Release, revocation and additional time sentenced to prison are mandatory if the violation is one of the following:</strong></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Possession of controlled substance (in violation of the condition set forth in section 18 U.S. C. 3563(a)(3));You possess a firearm<sup><a href="#footnote-862" id="footnote-ref-862">[862]</a></sup> (in violation of Federal law or a condition of probation), You refuse to comply with drug testing,<sup><a href="#footnote-863" id="footnote-ref-863">[863]</a></sup> orYou test positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year.<sup><a href="#footnote-864" id="footnote-ref-864">[864]</a></sup></strong></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153039"></a>What will happen if my violation was also a new criminal offense?</h3>
                <p class="text">All violations of the law are also violations of your conditions of supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-866" id="footnote-ref-866">[866]</a></sup> Essentially, the law treats a new criminal conviction as two wrongs: (1) Disobeying the federal court by violating a condition of your supervision, AND (2) Whatever you did to break the law.<sup><a href="#footnote-867" id="footnote-ref-867">[867]</a></sup> If you get arrested on state or federal charges while on federal probation or Supervised Release, you will probably be violated in federal court.A NOTE ABOUT SENTENCING WHEN THERE IS ANOTHER PENDING CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST YOU FOR THE SAME OFFENSE: Your sentence for the violation of your federal probation or Supervised Release will be SEPARATE from whatever sentence you might get in the other criminal case, and will probably FOLLOW your sentence for the new criminal conviction (in other words, these sentences will follow one after the other). </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153040"></a>What are possible sanctions for an alleged violation of federal probation or supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="text">When there’s an allegation that you violated your federal probation or Supervised Release, revocation proceedings will usually begin. The law and rules that govern these revocation hearings can be found in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 32.1.<sup><a href="#footnote-868" id="footnote-ref-868">[868]</a></sup> There will be a series of steps that you will follow in a revocation hearing, from appearing in front of a Magistrate Judge, to attending a Probable Cause Hearing, and finally attending a Revocation Hearing. The steps below are a general outline of the revocation process, and possible outcomes:</p>
                <h4 class="step">Initial Appearance</h4>
                <p>Whenever someone is first taken into federal custody or has been cited/summoned to federal court, he or she has an initial appearance before a Magistrate Judge. This appearance allows the Court to advise you of the charges, set a preliminary hearing date (unless waived or you are out of custody) and direct you to the District Judge presiding over your case. </p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">YOUR RIGHT TO COUNSEL</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If you had an Assistant Federal Defender before, that same attorney will probably represent you in the revocation process. In some cases you may get a different attorney from the same office. If you had a private lawyer but can no longer afford to pay, the court must appoint a lawyer for you.</p>
                <p><em>NOTE: If you are arrested outside of the federal district that has jurisdiction over your case (usually the place where you are being officially supervised), </em>then you have additional rights at this Initial Appearance stage. First, you have the right to an “Identity Hearing,” where the government must show only that you are the person named in the warrant for arrest, not that you actually committed the crime. Second, you have the right to receive a reliable certified electronic COPY of the original revocation petition that was filed (this right to receive a copy of the revocation petition is called “Arrival of Process”).<sup><a href="#footnote-869" id="footnote-ref-869">[869]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="step">Probable Cause Hearing</h4>
                <p>Know Your Rights! If you are held in custody for an alleged violation of your federal probation or Supervised Release, then you have the following rights:</p>
                <ol class="text">You must receive a prompt hearing to determine if there is “probable cause” to hold you for a revocation hearing (a.k.a. the “probable cause hearing”).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-870" id="footnote-ref-870">[870]</a></sup></sup> <em>If you are in custody</em>, you only receive what is called a “probable cause hearing.” This will usually happen within one week, but “prompt” does not have a specific timeframe, so it could be longer.<sup><a href="#footnote-871" id="footnote-ref-871">[871]</a></sup>You must be given notice of the hearing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-872" id="footnote-ref-872">[872]</a></sup></sup>You must be given an opportunity to appear and present evidence, an opportunity to question opposing witnesses (if requested), and be told of your right to an attorney.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-873" id="footnote-ref-873">[873]</a></sup></sup> The Rules of Evidence are more relaxed; hearsay is allowed. This means that the judge can consider evidence (testimony, photographs, etc.) that he would not be able to consider in a full criminal trial. You will usually appear before the same judge who sentenced you. The judge will explain your rights and make sure you have a lawyer. If you are not held to answer (i.e., probable cause is not found), then the allegations will be dismissed. If you are held to answer (i.e., probable cause is found), then you will be directed to a District Judge to enter an admission or denial to the allegations.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-874" id="footnote-ref-874">[874]</a></sup></sup> If you admit the allegations, the Judge will either set a future date for sentencing or sentence you right then and there. However, if you deny the allegations, then you go to a revocation hearing.</ol>
                <p class="text">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PENDING CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST YOU &amp; THE REVOCATION PROCESS: Unless your lawyer advises you otherwise, do not admit a violation that’s based on pending criminal charges until the pending charges are resolved. Admitting to criminal conduct during the revocation hearing in federal court could then be used against you in your pending criminal case. It’s best to consult with your attorney to figure out what to do in your situation.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Revocation Hearing</h4>
                <p>You have the right to a revocation hearing before a District Judge within a reasonable time in the district that has decision-making power (called “jurisdiction”) over your case<sup><a href="#footnote-875" id="footnote-ref-875">[875]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="textbox">Know Your Rights<br/>in the REvocation Process</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">You must be given notice of the hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-876" id="footnote-ref-876">[876]</a></sup>You must be given written notice of the charges against you (i.e., the alleged violation of your supervision).<sup><a href="#footnote-877" id="footnote-ref-877">[877]</a></sup>You must receive notice of your right to an attorney. If you can’t afford an attorney, you will be appointed a Federal Public Defender in your District, or another court-appointed defender.You must have the opportunity to appear at the revocation hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-878" id="footnote-ref-878">[878]</a></sup>You must have an opportunity to see the evidence against you, as well as the opportunity to present your own evidence;<sup><a href="#footnote-879" id="footnote-ref-879">[879]</a></sup>The Rules of Evidence are more relaxed; hearsay is allowed. This means that the judge can consider evidence (testimony, photographs, etc.) that he would not be able to consider in a full criminal trial.Additional constitutional rights described in <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/online-learning-center/supporting-materials/Revocation-of-Probation-and-Supervised-Released.pdf">http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/online-learning-center/supporting-materials/Revocation-of-Probation-and-Supervised-Released.pdf</a> (pp. 6-7).</ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153041"></a>What laws guide the court in sentencing me for my revocation of federal probation or supervised release?</h3>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE: The laws about revocation sentencing are confusing and difficult to figure out on your own! You have the right to lawyer if you can’t afford one, and it’s best to ask your attorney to walk through your specific situation and help you understand what the judge can sentence you to if your federal probation or Supervised Release is revoked. </p>
                <p>The chart shown below on PG. 248 is important because this period determines the maximum amount of time you can be sent to prison for violating the terms and conditions of your Supervised Release.</p>
                <p>For example, assume you have been convicted of a Class A felony and receive 5 years of Supervised Release. Then, let’s say, you violate the terms and conditions of your supervision. The judge may, but is not required to, sentence you to four years in prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-880" id="footnote-ref-880">[880]</a></sup> If the judge were to do that, you could only be placed on supervision for one additional year. However, if you were to violate your supervision again, the judge could sentence you up to the maximum available term of imprisonment (which is 5 years), but could not impose any additional supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-881" id="footnote-ref-881">[881]</a></sup> This could result in you serving nine years in prison on revocations when the original term of supervision was only 5 years. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">EXCEPTIONS: Offenses committed on or before April 30, 2003: </p>
                <p>There are special rules, however, if you committed the offense of conviction on or before April 30, 2003. Assume the same situation as described above: you’re convicted of a Class A felony, sentenced to prison with five years of Supervised Release. Upon your first revocation, you are sentenced four years in prison and one year of Supervised Release. If you violated your Supervised Release again, you can only be sentenced to one year in prison (meaning that the difference between the total term of Supervised Release available by statute for that offense minus the amount of prison imposed during any previous revocation(s)). This is different than the first scenario when the judge could impose a five-year term on a second revocation after imposing a four-year term on the first revocation. </p>
                <p><strong>REVOCATION SENTENCING GUIDELINES: </strong></p>
                <p>In addition to the statute governing the maximum terms of supervision, judges must consider the United States Sentencing Guidelines in determining your sentence upon revocation.<sup><a href="#footnote-882" id="footnote-ref-882">[882]</a></sup> The recommended sentence is based on (1) the Grade of Violation, (2) your Criminal History Category at the time of your original conviction, and (3) the Class of your original conviction.</p>
                <p>This chart outlines Congress’ recommended terms of imprisonment upon revocation:</p>
                <p><strong>REVO</strong><a id="revocationtable"></a><strong>CATION TABLE</strong></p>

                <p class="text">However, if you were on probation or supervised release as a result of a sentence for a Class A felony, the Congress’ recommendation looks like this: </p>

                <p>Although these are only recommendations for the judge, the judge must consider them first when rendering a decision.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153042"></a>Can I appeal the court’s revocation decision/action? What court has jurisdiction?</h3>
                <p>It depends. The appellate court (which is the court above the district court) that made the decision will have the authority to hear the case, unless you have already completed your time on supervision. In that case, appellate courts have held that they don’t have authority to hear the case, because your have already completed your sentence, and have no “injury” that the court can fix.<sup><a href="#footnote-883" id="footnote-ref-883">[883]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153043"></a>What will the judge look for when reviewing my appeal?</h3>
                <p>The judge who is reviewing your revocation case will look at different aspects using different legal standards.</p>
                <p>Unless a violation is for drug or firearm possession, which <em>requires revocation</em>, a district court judge’s decision to revoke your federal probation or Supervised Release will be reviewed by the higher-up appellate judge for “abuse of discretion.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-884" id="footnote-ref-884">[884]</a></sup></sup> This means, the judge reviewing your case will only grant you an appeal if they found that the district court judge below them actually mishandled your case—by acting unreasonably or incorrectly applying the law. </p>
                <p>The higher-up appellate judge who is reviewing your case can also review the LAW that was applied by the district court judge below as if the questions were being asked for the first time. In other words, the reviewing judge can freshly make his or her own judgment about whether the lower court correctly applied the law (this is called a “de novo” review).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-885" id="footnote-ref-885">[885]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>If there were any FACTUAL ERRORS made in your case, the appellate judge will view those for “clear error.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-886" id="footnote-ref-886">[886]</a></sup></sup> This means that the court will not find a factual error unless all the evidence together shows a mistake was made.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-887" id="footnote-ref-887">[887]</a></sup></sup> However, if you fail to object to an argument or a fact, then the judge in the appeals court may review the case under the “plain error” standard—a harder burden for you to meet (this means that the appeals court has to find that the error is extremely unjust or unfair). </p>
                <p>Again, the SENTENCE that you received at the revocation hearing will be reviewed for reasonableness, which means that the higher-up appellate judge looks to see if the judge at the district court below abused his or her discretion in making a decision in the case, by mishandling the case (acting unreasonably or incorrectly applying the law) .<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-888" id="footnote-ref-888">[888]</a></sup></sup></p>

                <h2><a id="PP_Federal_FederalParole_heading"></a><a id="_Toc448153045"></a>Federal community supervision: federal parolE</h2>
                <p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 eliminated federal parole for most people convicted of a federal crime. Now, instead of defendant’s serving an indeterminate sentence (i.e., one where a parole board determines how much of the Judge’s sentence you serve), all federal defendants serve 85% of his or her sentence. This is much like “mandatory release” discussed below. <em>See </em>the information on “RELEASE PLANNING” at Appendix II, PG. 348. In light of the Sentencing Reform Act, only a few groups of individuals are serving a federal parole sentences. </p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153046"></a>Basics of Federal Parole</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153047"></a>Who is released onto federal parole?</h3>
                <p class="textbox">Federal parole now applies only to individuals who were:</p>
                <ul class="textbox">Sentenced for a federal offense <em>before November 1, 1987</em>; Convicted of violating the laws of the District of Columbia in D.C.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153048"></a>If I am on federal parole, why do I report to a U.S. probation officer?</h3>
                <p>Federal U.S. Probation offices and officers are responsible for overseeing and administering federal parole.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-890" id="footnote-ref-890">[890]</a></sup></sup> U.S. Probation Officers provide parole services as request of the USPC. </p>
                <p>Thus, U.S. probation officers <em>function as parole officers</em> and <em>supervise people on federal parole and mandatory release</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-891" id="footnote-ref-891">[891]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153049"></a>Before Release: What to Know about Getting Released onto Federal Parole</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153050"></a>I am still incarcerated. What is the legal process for getting released from federal prison onto federal parole?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are several steps you will follow in planning for your release from federal prison onto federal parole. These will include creating a release plan, creating a plan for payment of restitution and fines, investigation of your plan, and release. Please see the Appendix II, PG. 348 to find out more. </p>
                <p><strong>STEP 1: Release Plan</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Once you have a release date from the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC), you must complete a satisfactory plan for parole supervision to actually get released. If the release plan is NOT approved, your release may be delayed regardless of the date the USPC had set when it first granted your parole.The Regional Commissioner of the USPC may change your date of release (earlier or later) onto parole to allow more time for release planning. At most, the Regional Commissioner can delay your release onto parole for 120 days; otherwise, you have the right to a hearing if the Regional Commissioner wants to push back your release date more than 120 days.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-892" id="footnote-ref-892">[892]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p><strong>Generally, you are required to have the following included in your release plan:</strong></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Availability of legitimate employment;An approved residence for the prospective parolee; andAvailability of necessary aftercare if you are ill or will require special care.<sup><a href="#footnote-893" id="footnote-ref-893">[893]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 2: Unpaid Fines &amp; Restitution</strong></p>
                <p>Your release onto parole might also be delayed if you still owe court-ordered fines or restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-894" id="footnote-ref-894">[894]</a></sup> When you still have fines or restitution to pay, a reasonable plan for payment, or a performance of services, if ordered by the court, will be included in your parole release plan, where feasible.<sup><a href="#footnote-895" id="footnote-ref-895">[895]</a></sup></p>
                <p><strong>STEP 3: Investigation Phase</strong></p>
                <p>Your U.S. Probation Officer will do an investigation to make sure that the person’s release plan is appropriate. This investigation will start with the probation officer asking you questions about your release plan. The probation officer will then follow up and verify your answers. For example, if you told the probation officer that your approved residence did not have any persons with a felony record, the probation officer will follow-up to make sure this is true. </p>
                <p><strong>STEP 4: Release</strong></p>
                <p>After the Parole Commission approves your release plan, and a U.S. Probation Officer completes an investigation, you will be released on the date set by the Parole Commission (unless there is misconduct or some other reason leading to a change in the date). </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153051"></a>What could happen if I refuse to sign the certificate of release?</h3>
                <p>If you don’t sign the certificate of release, one of the two following things could happen:</p>
                <p class="text">If you have been granted a parole date and you refuse to sign the certificate of release (or any other document necessary to fulfill a condition of release), the USPC will treat your refusal as a withdrawal of your application for parole, effective on the date of your refusal. You will not be released on parole and you will have to reapply for parole consideration.If you are scheduled for release to supervision through good-time deduction and you refuse to sign the certificate of release, you will be released but you still must follow the conditions listed on the certificate of release, or risk violation and revocation (see Appendix GG, PG. 344).<sup><a href="#footnote-896" id="footnote-ref-896">[896]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153052"></a>Do I have to return to the same community that I came from for my federal parole?</h3>
                <p>Usually, yes. In most instances, you will be released to parole in the U.S. Judicial District of your legal residence, or in the U.S. Judicial District where you were convicted of the federal offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-897" id="footnote-ref-897">[897]</a></sup> </p>
                <p>THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION: if the U.S. Parole Commission decides that your chances of success on parole will be better in another community, or believes it would serve “the public interest,” it can order you be paroled to a different District.<sup><a href="#footnote-898" id="footnote-ref-898">[898]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153053"></a>What is the difference between federal parole and “mandatory release”?</h3>
                <p>If you are never granted parole during your prison sentence, you will be released through “Mandatory Release” (unless you have forfeited all your statutory “good time credits”). The institution’s officials set your Mandatory Release date by calculating how much statutory “good time” credit you have a legal right to, and how much extra “good time” is earned. </p>
                <p>The law states that if you are entitled to Mandatory Release, you must “be treated as if released on parole” and are “subject to all provisions of the law relating to the parole of United States prisoners until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which [you were] sentenced, less 180 days.” What this really means is that you should have a release plan (see question above) as if you were going out on parole. You will also be supervised by a U.S. Probation Officer as if on federal parole until <em>180 days before the end date of your sentence</em>—so long as you don’t violate the conditions of your mandatory release, in which case the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC) can hold you under supervision until the original full term date of the sentence. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153054"></a>Is it possible that I be released from federal prison and not be on any type of community supervision?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes, it is possible, but rare. If you are NOT paroled and have less than 180 days left on your original sentence when you are released, you will be released <em>without supervision</em>. However, if a “special parole term” is being served, supervision will end at the full term date, and this 180-day date does not apply.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153055"></a>After Release: What to Expect in Your First Days Out on Federal Parole</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153056"></a>After I am released to federal parole, when and to whom must I report?</h3>
                <p>US. Probation Officers function as parole officers and provide supervision to persons released on parole or on mandatory release.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-899" id="footnote-ref-899">[899]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">You will go to <em>an approved residence</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-900" id="footnote-ref-900">[900]</a></sup></sup> and report <em>within 3 days</em> (72 hours) to the United States Probation Office shown on your <em>certificate of release</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-901" id="footnote-ref-901">[901]</a></sup></sup> You must continue to report to a U.S. Probation Officer in-person as instructed by your officer once released. In addition, you must submit a monthly written report, and follow all the conditions of your release.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-902" id="footnote-ref-902">[902]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Constitutional Concerns about detainers</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">State and local corrections officials frequently violate the 48-hour limitation by continuing to hold individuals beyond the period allowed by regulation, raising constitutional concerns. Detainers have resulted in the illegal imprisonment of many people—including U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, without any charges pending, sometimes for days or weeks after they should have been released from custody.</p>
                <ol class="text">U.S. Probation Officers must also provide you with parole services at the request of the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-903" id="footnote-ref-903">[903]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153057"></a><a id="PP_FEDDETAINER"></a>I am not a U.S. citizen, and I am told I have an outstanding detainer against me. What is a detainer? What could happen to me?</h3>
                <p>An ICE detainer is a written request by immigration officials to a local jail or other law enforcement agency that the agency detain an individual for an additional 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) after his or her release date so that ICE officials can decide whether to take the individual into federal custody and begin formal deportation proceedings.</p>
                <p>A “detainer”—or “immigration hold”—is one of the key tools U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses to apprehend individuals who come in contact with local and state law enforcement agencies and put them into the federal immigration, and often times, deportation system. </p>
                <p><em>Even if you have a detainer against you</em>, the USPC may still grant you release onto federal parole if you meet the other criteria in 28 C.F.R. § 2.18.

There are several steps to challenge the Parole Commission’s decision not to let you off federal parole early. Please see the Appendix JJ, PG. 349 for full details on each step. </p>
                <p>STEP 1: You may send a written appeal to the National Appeals Board challenging any decision to grant (other than a decision to grant parole on the date of parole eligibility), rescind, deny, or revoke parole. </p>

If because of an emergency you are unable to appear in person within 3 days (72 hours) after your release, you should report to the nearest U.S. Probation Office and obey any instructions that the “duty officer” gives you. If you were released to another authority (not U.S. Probation), then you should follow these first 2 steps as soon as you are released from the custody of the other authority.Cooperate with your Probation Officer, and provide any information requested to your Probation Officer. You must answer completely and truthfully when the Probation Officer asks you for information.Between the first and third day of each month, you must make a written report to the supervision officer on a form provided to you.<sup> </sup>The written report will look different depending where you are. It will most likely look like a worksheet where you will fill out your address, job information, and answer other questions about your life, or a form that you will fill out and submit on line at the probation office’s website. Your Probation Officer will show you how to fill this out and give it to you at your check-in. Report to your Probation Officer as that officer directs. </ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Talking to your P.O. about an Arrest</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Under the federal law that governs federal parole, if you end up being arrested for an incident that police questioned you about (or any other incident), you must tell your probation officer. It could help to show the USPC that you are being honest with your P.O. and trying hard to comply.</p>
                <ol class="text">Tell your Probation Officer if you are arrested or questioned by law enforcement/police within 2 days of the contact with law enforcement. Tell your Probation Officer if you change your job or address within 2 days of the change.You must let the Probation Officer to visit your home and workplace.You must let the Probation Officer take any item that the officer reasonably believes you are not allowed to have (for example, an illegal drug or a weapon), and that is in plain view in your possession (meaning they can see it without having to open drawers or dig through compartments), including in your home, workplace, or vehicle.You must take a drug or alcohol test whenever your Probation Officer orders you to take the test.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-925" id="footnote-ref-925">[925]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <p>Conditions that Prohibit Conduct:</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153068"></a>What special conditions could apply to me on federal parole?</h3>
                <p>If the U.S. Parole Commission determines that it is necessary<em> to protect the public from further crimes and to provide adequate supervision over you</em>, it may impose a special condition other than one of the general conditions above. Examples of special conditions of release that the Commission might require of you are found at 28 C.F.R. § 2.204(b)(2), and include the following possible requirements:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>If the Parole Commission requires you to participate in a drug-treatment program</em>, you must submit to a drug test before release and to at least two other drug tests, as determined by your Probation Officer. <em>However</em>, a decision not to impose this special condition, because available information indicates that you have a low risk of future substance abuse, constitutes <em>good cause</em> (a good reason under law) for suspending the drug testing requirements of 18 U.S.C. 4209(a).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-932" id="footnote-ref-932">[932]</a></sup></sup> Furthermore, a grant of parole or re-parole depends on your passing all pre-release drug tests administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-933" id="footnote-ref-933">[933]</a></sup></sup>You must live in or participate in a program at a community corrections center, or both, for all or part of your period of supervision;You must participate in a drug-or alcohol-treatment program, and abstain from all use of alcohol and other intoxicants;As an alternative to incarceration, you may be put on house arrest (home confinement), meaning you remain at home during nonworking hours, and your compliance is monitored by telephone or electronic signaling devices;You must allow a supervising off it a time of their choosing, to conduct a search of your person, or of any building, vehicle, or other area under your control, and to seize contraband found.</strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153069"></a>Can federal parole require me to go to a HALFWAY house or require me to undergo drug or alcohol treatment while I’m under supervision?</h3>
                <p>Yes.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-934" id="footnote-ref-934">[934]</a></sup></sup> Federal law allows the U.S. Parole Commission to require you to go into a halfway house or undergo treatment for drug or alcohol for all or part of the time under supervision. In most cases, you will be notified in advance and may submit comments about that proposal to the Parole Commission <em>before</em> the final decision is made.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-935" id="footnote-ref-935">[935]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153070"></a>If I’m on parole, may I own, use or possess firearms after they are released?</h3>
                <p>No—almost never. Except in very rare situations, federal law forbids anyone who has ever been convicted of a felony from possessing firearms or ammunition. Generally, you will not be permitted to own or possess a firearm or ammunition.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-936" id="footnote-ref-936">[936]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153071"></a>Can the parole commission change any of my conditions of release?</h3>
                <p>Yes. If you believe the conditions on your Certificate of Release are unfair, you may ask the Case Manager for an appeal form and submit it to the Regional Commissioner within 30 days after your release. The U.S. Parole Commission will consider the appeal and you will be notified of the decision within 21 days after you file your appeal. While the appeal is pending, the parolee must continue to abide by the conditions imposed.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-937" id="footnote-ref-937">[937]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153072"></a>After a parolee is released, may any of the conditions be changed? Can additional ones be imposed?</h3>
                <p>Yes.<em> </em>The Probation Officer or the U.S. Parole Commission may propose changing or adding to your conditions of federal parole. You will be notified of any such proposal and be given up to 10 days to make any written comments to the U.S. Parole Commission. You will be notified within 21 days after you provide written comments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-938" id="footnote-ref-938">[938]</a></sup></sup> </p>

                <h4 class="sidebox">Improving your chances of having a TRANSFER request approved</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Your request is much more likely to be approved if you have a good track record – clean drug tests, always going to your meetings with your Probation Officer, staying out of trouble with law enforcement. </p>
                <p>To transfer districts, you need to discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. </p>
                <p>To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of both the Probation Officer from the transferring district <em>and</em> from the receiving district. You can only transfer if it doesn’t go against the instructions from the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-940" id="footnote-ref-940">[940]</a></sup></sup> If you meet the criteria, have your plan approved, and sign the required forms and submit a transfer request through the Interstate Compact Offender Tracking System (ICOTS), your transfer request will then be submitted to the other state for investigation and a decision on acceptance or rejection. </p>

                <p>An Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision governs transferring between states for adults under all types of community supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-941" id="footnote-ref-941">[941]</a></sup></sup> The Compact has been adopted by all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-942" id="footnote-ref-942">[942]</a></sup></sup> An Interstate Commission has developed rules for transfer eligibility and supervision. </p>

                <p>At the <em>discretion of the sending state</em>, you are eligible and can be approved for transfer <em>if you meet the following criteria:</em></p>
                <ol class="text">You have more than 90 calendar days or an indefinite period of supervision remaining at the time the sending state transmits the transfer request; andYou have a valid plan of supervision; andYou are in substantial compliance with the terms of supervision in the sending state (meaning you have not had your probation or parole revoked <em>and</em> you have no pending revocation charges); and<em>Either:</em>You are a resident of the receiving state, ORYou have family in the receiving state who indicate a willingness and ability to assist (as specified in your supervision plan) <em>and</em> you can obtain employment in the receiving state or have some other means of support.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-944" id="footnote-ref-944">[944]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <h4 class="textbox">ALTERNATIVE OPTION: </h4>
                <p><em>Even if you do not meet the above criteria</em> and eligibility requirements for interstate parole transfer, the sending and receiving states may also <em>agree</em> to transfer you if there is <em>good cause</em> to do so. To pursue this option:</p>
                <p>STEP 1: Discuss the transfer with your Probation Officer.</p>
                <p>STEP 2: If the special circumstances and <em>good cause</em> for transferring your supervision are approved, the sending state must provide the receiving state enough documentation to justify the transfer.</p>
                <p>STEP 3: The receiving state shall have the discretion to accept or reject the transfer of supervision in a manner consistent with the purpose of the Interstate Compact.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-946" id="footnote-ref-946">[946]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question">How do I start the process?</h5>
                <p class="answer">To get the process started, you should talk to your federal correctional counselor or federal probation agent. The parole agent should determine whether you meet the eligibility criteria. If the criteria are met, the agent should submit a transfer application to the department’s Interstate Compact Unit (In California, the CDCR’s Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento). If that unit approves your application, the request will be sent to the receiving state.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-947" id="footnote-ref-947">[947]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <h5 class="question">How long will it take?</h5>
                <p class="answer">The earliest that your supervising agency can send a transfer request is 120 days before your expected release date from prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-948" id="footnote-ref-948">[948]</a></sup></sup> The receiving state is supposed to respond within 45 calendar days of receiving a transfer request.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-949" id="footnote-ref-949">[949]</a></sup></sup> The process can be expedited in an emergency.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-950" id="footnote-ref-950">[950]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153076"></a>I am classified as a sex offender and want to transfer to another state. How can I do that? </h3>
                <p>You must meet the above 5 criteria, AND you must be able to meet additional specific requirements for transferring the supervision of people classified as sex offenders.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-951" id="footnote-ref-951">[951]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p><em>NOTE:</em> You cannot leave the sending state until the receiving state has approved the transfer request or issued reporting instructions.</p>
                <p>Follow these steps:</p>
                <p>STEP 1: Discuss your desire to transfer with your U.S. Probation Officer.</p>
                <p>STEP 2: Satisfy all of the eligibility criteria. At the <em>discretion of the sending state</em>, you are eligible and can be approved for transfer <em>if you meet the following criteria and all 5 of the criteria above (see previous page).</em></p>
                <p>STEP 3: Complete an Application for Transfer.</p>
                <p>STEP 4: The sending state must send the receiving state:</p>
                <ol class="text">Assessment information, including sex offender specific assessments;Social history;Information relevant to the sex offender’s criminal sexual behaviorLaw enforcement report that provides specific details of sex offense;Victim information: including the name, sex, age and relationship to the offender <em>and</em> the statement of the victim or victim’s representative;The sending state’s current or recommended supervision and treatment plan.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-952" id="footnote-ref-952">[952]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p>STEP 5: The receiving state has 5 business days to review the proposed residence. If the proposed residence is not acceptable due to existing state law or policy, the receiving state may deny the application. No travel permit can be granted by the sending state until the receiving state says it can.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-953" id="footnote-ref-953">[953]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>STEP 6: A travel permit will be given to you by your Probation Officer if the receiving state has approved the new residence. Travel permits are issued by the local parole office, so each office uses a different form. Your Probation Officer will give you this form once you have been approved by the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-954" id="footnote-ref-954">[954]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153077"></a>Violations &amp; Revocation of Federal Parole</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153078"></a>What could happen if I violate the conditions of my federal parole (or mandatory release)?</h3>
                <p>First, a U.S. Probation Officer will likely report the violation to the U.S. Parole Commission. While your Probation Officer is <em>required</em> to report any and all violations to the U.S. Parole Commission (USPC), the officer may recommend that you be continued under supervision without sanctions.</p>
                <p>Second, a Parole Commissioner determines the appropriate punishment (called “sanctions”), which could include: </p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Issuance of an arrest warrant, <em>or</em> A summons for you to appear at a hearing.</strong></p>
                <p class="text">The Probation Officer's recommendation is one of the factors considered by the Commission in its decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-955" id="footnote-ref-955">[955]</a></sup></sup> At this stage of the process, there are two reasons why the USPC might wait to issue an arrest warrant or a hearing summons:</p>
                <ol class="text">It may wait until, in the opinion of the Commission, the <em>frequency or seriousness of violations</em> requires it to issue a warrant or summons; You (the parolee) have been charged with a new criminal offense and are awaiting disposition of the charge, so the Commission may decide to (1) withhold the summons, (2) issue and hold the warrant in abeyance, or (2) issue a warrant and place a detainer on you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-956" id="footnote-ref-956">[956]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p>Third, the warrant will be “executed,” which means that you will be taken into custody or asked to come to a hearing. What happens next will depend on your personal circumstances, but the different possibilities are described in the next two questions. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153079"></a>Who issues an arrest warrant or summons to appear at a hearing if I violate federal parole or mandatory release?</h3>
                <p>Only a Parole Commissioner may issue a warrant or a summons for a violation of the conditions of your release on federal parole.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-957" id="footnote-ref-957">[957]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>Any officer of any Federal correctional institution or any Federal officer authorized to execute the warrant will do so by returning you to the custody of the Attorney General.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-958" id="footnote-ref-958">[958]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>You must be served with a summons to appear at a preliminary interview or revocation hearing by a Federal officer who is authorized to serve you, and proof of such service shall be returned to the appropriate regional office of the USPC.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-959" id="footnote-ref-959">[959]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153080"></a>After a warrant or summons is issued, what happens?</h3>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You will be either taken into custody, usually in the nearest government-approved jail or detention center, <em>or</em> summoned to appear at a hearing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-960" id="footnote-ref-960">[960]</a></sup></sup>If you have been convicted of a new offense, a Probation Officer will personally advise you of your legal rights and conduct a preliminary interview.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-961" id="footnote-ref-961">[961]</a></sup></sup>The Regional Commissioner will pick an official to conduct a preliminary interview with you —this official could be a U.S. Probation Officer in the district where you are confined, so long as it is not the same U.S. Probation Officer who recommended that you be arrested.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-962" id="footnote-ref-962">[962]</a></sup></sup>You’ll go through a preliminary interview (sometimes called a probable cause hearing) by the official, which will be used to help the U.S. Parole Commission determine if there is probable cause to believe you actually violated your parole conditions. If the Parole Commission finds probable cause, then it must decide whether to conduct a final revocation hearing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-963" id="footnote-ref-963">[963]</a></sup></sup>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK FOR AN ATTORNEY &amp; INVITE WITNESSES TO THE PRELIMINARY HEARING!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-964" id="footnote-ref-964">[964]</a></sup></sup> At the beginning of the preliminary interview, the interviewing officer <em>must</em>:</strong></p>

You will most likely qualify for an attorney if you cannot afford one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-967" id="footnote-ref-967">[967]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK THE PAROLE COMMISSION TO MAKE WITNESSES WHO PROVIDED INFORMATION LEADING TO YOUR REVOCATION CHARGE APPEAR AT THE PRELIMINARY INTERVIEW—</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">You should request that the Commission bring in anyone who has given information that it will use in its decision to revoke or reinstate your parole. Such adverse witnesses shall be requested to attend the preliminary interview unless (1) you admit a violation; or (2) have been convicted of a new offense while on supervision; or (3) the interviewing officer finds good cause for their absence.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-968" id="footnote-ref-968">[968]</a></sup></sup> The Parole Commission may <em>subpoena </em>(meaning order through the court) witnesses who are against your interest (adverse) and the production of documents.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-969" id="footnote-ref-969">[969]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>AT THE PRELIMINARY INTERVIEW, THE INTERVIEWING OFFICER <em>MUST</em>:</strong></p>

                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PRELIMINARY INTERVIEW, THE INTERVIEWING OFFICER <em>MUST</em>:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">Tell you his or her recommended decision as to whether there is probable cause to believe that you violated the conditions of your parole.Tell you recommendation and the basis for it.Submit to the Parole Commission a summary of the preliminary interview along with the officer’s recommended decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-971" id="footnote-ref-971">[971]</a></sup> In this report, the interviewing officer will recommend (1) whether there is “probable cause” to believe that a violation has occurred AND (2) whether you should be held in custody pending a revocation hearing <em>or</em> be reinstated to your parole supervision. </ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">A Finding of Probable Cause</h4>
                <p class="textbox">Just because an interviewing officer finds “probable cause” to believe you violated your parole, does not mean that your parole has been revoked. It just means that there is reason to believe you did what the warrant says you did—you will still have a chance to be reinstated at your Final Revocation Hearing. “Probable cause” is a very low standard, meaning an interviewing officer will most likely find “probable cause,” but you can still be reinstated at your Final Revocation Hearing. </p>
                <p>After the interviewing officer’s report is received, the Parole Commission will either order you reinstated to supervision <em>or</em> order that a Hearing Examiner hold you in custody for a revocation hearing.</p>
                <p>Even if the Commission finds probable cause to believe you have violated the conditions of your parole, it may still order you reinstated back to parole supervision <em>or</em> release you pending further proceedings <em>if:</em></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Continued revocation proceedings are <em>not warranted</em>;<sup> </sup>ORKeeping you in jail is <em>not necessary</em> because the you have not violated multiple times or the charge you are facing is not serious, and you are likely to appear for further proceedings, and don’t constitute a danger to yourself or others.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-972" id="footnote-ref-972">[972]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>
                <p>If you’re convicted of a new offense, you are NOT entitled to a preliminary interview because the conviction is sufficient evidence (probable cause is automatically shown) that you violated your conditions of parole. In that case, you may be immediately transported to a federal institution for a revocation hearing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-973" id="footnote-ref-973">[973]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153081"></a>May a parolee have an attorney at a preliminary interview and revocation hearing?</h3>
                <p>Yes. You have the right to an attorney of your choice, or you may request to have the court appoint you an attorney if you can’t afford your own.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-974" id="footnote-ref-974">[974]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>You do not have a constitutional right to have an attorney at your parole revocation hearing, but you will most likely qualify for an attorney if you cannot afford one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-975" id="footnote-ref-975">[975]</a></sup></sup> You should apply for an attorney with the District Court in your judicial district. It is your responsibility to tell your attorney the time and place of the hearing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-976" id="footnote-ref-976">[976]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153082"></a>Will I be in prison pending hearing?</h3>
                <p>It depends. If you were picked up on an arrest warrant issued by the USPC, you will be held in custody until a final decision about your revocation or release. </p>
                <p>The only exception is if the Regional Commissioner orders otherwise, but this is not likely. If you received a summons to a revocation hearing (under 28 C.F.R. § 2.44), you will remain on supervision pending the decision of the Commission.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-977" id="footnote-ref-977">[977]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153083"></a>Where are the revocation hearings held?</h3>
                <p>The revocation hearing will be either (1) an institutional hearing OR (2) a local hearing.</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>INSTITUTIONAL HEARINGS: Generally, revocation hearings are held after you are returned to a federal institution. An institutional hearing is held within 90 days from time you were taken into custody on the U.S. Parole Commission’s warrant.<em>OR</em></strong></p>
                <p class="text">LOCAL HEARINGS: If there are sufficient reasons to do so, the U.S. Parole Commission may order your revocation hearing held in your own community or in the community where you were arrested. <em>You only have the right to a local hearing if:</em> (1) You deny violating the conditions of your release, AND (2) You were NOT convicted of a new crime. If a local revocation hearing is requested, the you must complete a request form. There is a penalty for false answers on this form. Local revocation hearings are generally held within 60 days from the date the Regional Commissioner finds “probable cause” that parole or mandatory release was violated.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-978" id="footnote-ref-978">[978]</a></sup></sup> If granted, your local revocation hearing will be scheduled to happen reasonably near the place of the alleged violation(s) or arrest.<em>A NOTE ABOUT GETTING SUPPORT FROM A LAWYER:</em> At a local revocation hearing, you are more likely to have a lawyer and you can request that all adverse witnesses be called so you can confront and cross-examine them. In order to get a local revocation hearing, you and your attorney must (1) deny all the charges and (2) request a local revocation hearing. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153084"></a>What is the timeline of the hearing?</h3>
                <p>A local revocation hearing must be within 60 days of the probable cause determination. Institutional revocation must be held within 90 days of the date the warrant was executed, when you were taken into custody. However, you can request postponement or consent to a postponed revocation proceeding.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-979" id="footnote-ref-979">[979]</a></sup></sup></p>

                <p>You do not have the right to appointed counsel, but may secure an attorney at your own expense. NOTE: The attorney can act only in the capacity of a representative.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-980" id="footnote-ref-980">[980]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153086"></a>What is the hearing procedure?</h3>
                <p class="text">The purpose is to determine whether you have violated the conditions of your release and, if so, whether your parole or mandatory release should be (1) revoked (taken away) or (2) reinstated (where you continue on parole as you were).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-981" id="footnote-ref-981">[981]</a></sup></sup> To get more information about how to prepare for the hearing, please see the Appendix KK, PG. 350 </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153087"></a>When is revocation mandatory?</h3>
                <p>If the USPC finds after a revocation hearing that you:</p>
                <p>(1) Possessed a controlled substance, </p>
                <p>(2) Refused to comply with drug testing, </p>

                <p>(4) Tested positive for illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1 year, the USPC <em>must revoke</em> your term of supervision and impose a term of prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-982" id="footnote-ref-982">[982]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>If you fail a drug test, the USPC must consider appropriate alternatives to revocation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-983" id="footnote-ref-983">[983]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153088"></a>How could I be sentenced for a revocation of federal parole?</h3>
                <p>If the Parole Commission finds by a “preponderance of the evidence,” (that it is more likely than not) that you violated a condition of the parole, the Commission may take any of the following actions:</p>
                <ol class="text">Continue your supervision on federal parole, which can include:Reprimanding you;Modifying (changing) your conditions of release;Referring you to a community corrections center for all or part of the remainder of your original sentence;</ol>
                <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">Revoke your parole, and send you back to prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-984" id="footnote-ref-984">[984]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">In determining whether to revoke parole for not paying a fine, restitution, court costs or assessment, and/or court-ordered child support or alimony payment that was a condition of your release on supervision, the U.S. Parole Commission <em>must consider </em>your <em>employment status, earning ability, financial resources, and any other special circumstances that may have a bearing on the matter</em>. Revocation shall not be ordered unless you are found to be deliberately evading or refusing compliance.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-985" id="footnote-ref-985">[985]</a></sup></sup> (Learn more about court-ordered debt in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153089"></a>If the commission revokes parole or mandatory release, does a parolee get any credit on the sentence for the time spent under supervision?</h3>
                <p>Generally, if you are convicted of a <em>new law violation</em>, you are entitled to credit for any of the time spent under supervision unless serving a Youth Corrections Act (YCA) or Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Act (NARA) commitment. </p>
                <p>Also, there is no credit given for any time a parolee intentionally failed to respond or report to a Probation Officer or after a parolee has absconded from his or her area and the Probation Officer did not know where he or she was living. For violation of any of the other noncriminal conditions, a parolee generally will be credited for all of the time spent under supervision in the community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-986" id="footnote-ref-986">[986]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153090"></a>If I get my federal parole revoked, how long must I serve before the parole commission reviews my case again?</h3>
                <p>The U.S. Parole Commission uses its own guidelines to determine the length of time you should serve in prison for the revocation. The guidelines are the same ones used for inmates who apply for their initial parole hearings. Decisions, of course, can be made above or below the guidelines for good cause (a good reason).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-987" id="footnote-ref-987">[987]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153091"></a>Can I appeal the revocation decision by the U.S. Parole Commission?</h3>
                <p>Yes. It’s the same process discussed above (PG. 256) for appealing a denial of early release from parole to the National Appeals Board.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-988" id="footnote-ref-988">[988]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>The U.S. Attorney General can also appeal a Regional Parole Commissioner’s decision.</p>
                <p>The Attorney General, within 30 days after entry of a Regional Commissioner's decision, may send a <em>written request</em> to the National Appeals Board to review the decision. Within 60 days of the receipt of the request the National Appeals Board must affirm, modify, or reverse the decision, or order a rehearing at the institutional or regional level, and send a written decision to the Attorney General and to you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-989" id="footnote-ref-989">[989]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>If the Commission finds out you were convicted of a new crime after your revocation hearing for something you did while you were on parole, the Regional Commissioner may reopen your case pursuant to § 2.52(c)(2) for a special reconsideration hearing on the next regularly scheduled docket to consider whether you should give up your time spent on parole or any other consequence that he may think is appropriate. If he decides to change something, this new ruling will replace the ruling you got at your hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-990" id="footnote-ref-990">[990]</a></sup></p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153092"></a>Di<a id="disabilities_federal"></a>sability Rights for People on All Types of Federal Supervision</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153093"></a>I have a disability. What rights do I have on federal probation or parole to have accommodations for my disability?</h3>
                <p>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects individuals on federal probation/federal parole from discrimination due to their disabilities.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-991" id="footnote-ref-991">[991]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>The Rehabilitation Act provides essentially the same protections as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including the right to <em>reasonable changes</em> in policies, rules, and conditions; <em>equal opportunity to participate</em> in programs, services, and benefits; and <em>additional assistance</em> (services or devices) so that you can participate in programs and activities related to your supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-992" id="footnote-ref-992">[992]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>Thus, federal probation staff must offer you the same types of accommodations and services discussed for state parole under “State Parole: Disabilities and the ADA,” see PG. 181.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153094"></a>How can I file a complaint if I feel that my federal probation officer is not accommodating my disability, or feel that I am not getting access to parole services or programs?</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, there are no special procedures or forms to seek accommodations for your disability, or to complain about overly restrictive conditions under federal supervision. There are several steps you can take to try and rectify the situation. </p>
                <p>STEP 1: If your disability makes it difficult to comply with your federal probation or parole conditions, or your conditions are overly strict and cause you harm due to your disability, the first thing to do is talk with your U.S. probation officer.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-993" id="footnote-ref-993">[993]</a></sup></sup> You should explain:</p>
                <p><em>Your disability</em>; </p>
                <p><em>Which condition of supervision</em> is causing you problems due to your disability (e.g., drug testing conditions that prevent you from taking necessary medication) or how you are being <em>treated differently</em> due to your disability (e.g., you are stopped from participating in certain programs due to your disability or related medical treatment) or why you need additional help to participate in activities or follow the rules of supervision; <em>and</em></p>
                <p><em>What accommodations</em> (like changes in rules, policies, or procedures), services, or other assistance you need for your disability.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-994" id="footnote-ref-994">[994]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>If you have any other documents—such as a letter from your doctor or prescription for medication—you should show that to your probation officer. You can also remind your probation officer that federal law requires him or her to provide “reasonable accommodations” for your disability. Your probation officer, along with the judge and any medical providers who help you with your disability, will consider your situation and make a case-by-case decision about whether and how to accommodate your disability.</p>
                <p>STEP 2: If you are unhappy with your probation officer’s decision, you can ask a supervisor for assistance. If the probation department does not provide the assistance you need, you can go to court to request a change in your supervision conditions or other accommodations.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-995" id="footnote-ref-995">[995]</a></sup></sup> </p>
                <p>STEP 3: You have the right to file an administrative complaint with the Department of Justice, which will investigate and attempt to resolve cases of discrimination based on disability, including a hearing and appeal process.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-996" id="footnote-ref-996">[996]</a></sup></sup> Note, however that this process can take a long time to complete, so it’s best as a last resort.</p>

                <p class="text">Being under some type of supervision is usually required for you to be released from prison or jail. In California, there are many types of supervision—state parole, county probation, Mandatory Supervision, PRCS, federal probation, Supervised, and federal parole. Hopefully now that you’ve read this Chapter, you better understand what it means to be under supervision, what special rules you have to follow, and all of the rights you have as a person in reentry.</p>

                <p><strong>(Excerpted with slight modifications from Prison Law Office, The Parolee Rights Handbook, August 2013, available for download on their website at: </strong><a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf">http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/ParoleeManual,Aug2013.pdf</a><strong>)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>FOR PEOPLE ON STATE PAROLE:<br/>How Is the Parole Discharge Date Calculated?</strong></p>
                <p class="text">A parolee who is not serving life-long parole and who is retained past the “presumptive discharge date” can calculate when he or she must be discharged from parole. There are two important dates: the “controlling discharge date” (CDD) and the “maximum discharge date” (MDD). The CDD is the date that a parolee is currently set to be discharged from parole if nothing changes. The MDD is the maximum parole term as set by statute, after which the parolee must be discharged. Two types of events may change the CDD and MDD:</p>
                <ol class="text">Time during which a parolee absconds or is unavailable for supervision does not count toward either the CDD or MDD. There is no limit on how long the CDD and MDD can be extended due to absconding or unavailability.Time served in custody for parole revocation terms will extend the CDD, but only until the MDD is reached.</ol>
                <p class="text">The pieces of information a parolee needs to figure out his or her CDD and MDD are: (1) the initial parole date; (2) the base and maximum parole terms that apply to his or her case (see Section 16.A, above); (3) how much time he or she has been unavailable for supervision, if any; and (4) the amount of time he or she has served in custody on parole violations. Here is a calculation worksheet that can be used by any parolee, with an example of a calculation for a parolee named Joe who is serving a three-year parole term with a maximum term of four years following a determinate sentence for a non-serious, non-violent, non-sex offense. </p>
                <p><strong>Worksheet</strong></p>
                <table><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Start with the date the parolee was first paroled. For our example, Joe paroled on January 1, 2013.</strong></p></td><td><p>1/1/2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Add the amount of time the parolee must serve before a presumptive discharge review. Joe has a presumptive discharge date of six months plus 30 days, and was eligible for early discharge on July 1, 2013.</strong></p></td><td><p>7/1/2013</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>However, the BPH acted to retain Joe on parole, so his CDD will be set by his full statutory base parole period. Joe has a three-year base parole period, so his CDD is January 1, 2016. Joe has a statutory maximum parole term of four years, so his MDD is January 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>1/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>1/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe absconded from parole, and the “clock” on his parole term stopped running during that time. This extends both the CDD and the MDD. Joe absconded for three months, so his CDD is now April 1, 2016, and his MDD is now April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>4/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe also violated parole and served a parole revocation term in custody. This extends the CDD but only until the MDD is reached. Joe’s revocation term was 180 days, but he only served 90 days in jail because he behaved well and got good conduct credits. Thus, 90 days is added to his CDD, which is now July 1, 2016. The revocation time does not affect Joe’s MDD, which is still April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>7/1/2016 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="listparagraph"><strong>Joe violated parole two more times and got two more 180-day revocation terms (360 days total); while he was in jail, Joe got into fights and refused to work, so he did not get any good conduct credits. The time Joe spends in jail extends his CDD but does not affect his MDD. Also, since a CDD cannot be further in the future than an MDD, Joe has “maxed out” and will be discharged on April 1, 2017.</strong></p></td><td><p>4/1/2017 (CDD)</p><p>4/1/2017 (MDD)</p></td></tr></table>

Time during which parole is suspended because the prisoner has absconded or has been returned to custody as a parole violator shall not be credited toward any period of parole unless the prisoner is found not guilty of the parole violation. However, the period of parole is subject to the following:</p>

                <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS A HABEAS CORPUS PETITION?</div>
                <p class="text">Once you have gone through the entire 602 appeal process by filing your grievance with the appropriate agency OR if you’ve exhausted administrative remedies because CDCR/Parole didn’t get back to you on an appeal within the legal timeline require by law, you may then file a state-level petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A habeas corpus petition can be based on any rights guaranteed by the federal or state constitutions, statutes, or regulations. Through a habeas corpus petition, a state parolee (just like a state prisoner challenging conditions of his/her confinement) can ask a court to order “injunctive relief,” meaning that the court will order prison or parole officials to do something or to stop doing something. For example, a court could order parole officials to drop an invalid parole condition or fix a parole term length miscalculation. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">What deadlines should I be aware of if i want to file A writ HABEAS CORPUS in state court?</div>
                <p class="text">There is no deadline or time limit on when you can file a habeas petition. But keep in mind that, the longer you wait, the more you should be prepared to explain in detail, to the court, why you didn’t file the petition sooner.<sup><a href="#footnote-1010" id="footnote-ref-1010">[1010]</a></sup> You can only file a habeas petition if you have “exhausted” (meaning that you completed or gone through) all other administrative remedies. You exhaust the administrative remedies by completing the three levels of the appeals process discussed on PG. 175. You must file your habeas petition while you are still under some form of custody or parole. At the time you file your habeas petition, you must currently be affected by the condition that you are appealing. If you are no longer suffering from the condition that you are appealing, the court will likely dismiss your habeas petition.<sup><a href="#footnote-1011" id="footnote-ref-1011">[1011]</a></sup></p>
                <div class="questionheading">HOW DO I FILE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS IN STATE COURT?</div>
                <p class="text">Here are the steps you should take to prepare your habeas petition:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Your petition should include a Judicial Council MC-275 form. You can access this form at: </strong><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc275.pdf"><strong>http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc275.pdf</strong></a><strong>.In addition to the MC-275 form, you must include the following information in your habeas petition:Identify the type of custody you are under (i.e. you are on parole) and the person who supervises you (your parole office and CDCR)Name a “respondent” (meaning the opposing party) in your case. If you are on parole, the respondent is the Director of CDCR. Describe why your current parole conditions are illegal (i.e. your parole term length has been miscalculated) State whether you have filed any previous court actions about the illegal condition Verify (swear that you are telling the truth) the statements you’ve made in your petition Include any supporting documents, such as sworn declarations by witnesses with your petition If you want to ask the court to appoint an attorney to your case, you should file a “Declaration of Indigence” and “Request for Appointment of Counsel.”For a sample habeas petition, please visit: </strong><a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/STATEHABEAS2008.pdf"><strong>http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/STATEHABEAS2008.pdf</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
                <div class="questionheading">HOW AND WHERE DO I FILE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS?</div>
                <p class="text">Usually, you should file your habeas petition with the Superior Court of the county that you are on parole in.<sup><a href="#footnote-1012" id="footnote-ref-1012">[1012]</a></sup> You can file your petition by mailing it to the Superior Court clerk. Remember: any time you file documents with the superior court clerk, you should include an extra copy of the cover page along with a self-addressed stamped envelope so that the clerk can send you a copy with the date of filing and your case number. If the court determines that you case should proceed, you will have to “serve” the opposing party. Serving the opposing party means that you will have to send CDCR a copy of your petition along with a “Proof of Service” form that verifies that you have served the document. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">HOW CAN I HAVE AN ATTORNEY APPOINTED TO MY CASE?</div>
                <p class="text">You can request an attorney by filing a “Declaration of Indigency” and “Request for Appointment of Counsel.”</p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHEN WILL I HEAR BACK FROM THE COURT ABOUT MY PETITION?</div>
                <p class="text">The judge must act within 60 days from the day you file your petition.<sup><a href="#footnote-1013" id="footnote-ref-1013">[1013]</a></sup> Note: Unless the court orders an Order to Show Cause (OSC), you do not have the right to an attorney. But if the court does issue an OSC, it must appoint an attorney to your case if you cannot afford one. See below for more information on OSCs.</p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT CAN THE COURT DO WITH MY PETITION?	</div>
                <p class="text">The judge at the state court may take the following actions in response to your petition:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Deny your petition: If the court denies your petition, it must explain the reasons why it is denying your petitionRequest an informal response from the respondent (the opposing party): If the court thinks your case may have merit, but the court still wants more information prior to taking any actions, the court can ask both parties to submit informal briefings. Your reply can be as simple as a letter back to the court (you must also serve the opposing party with a copy of your response). Your response will be due 15 days after the date that the court requested an informal response (unless the court specifies another due date).<sup><a href="#footnote-1014" id="footnote-ref-1014">[1014]</a></sup> Issue an “Order to Show Cause”: This will require the opposing party (called the “respondent”) to file an explanation why the court should not grant your petition. </strong></p>
                <p class="text">If the court decides that your case has merit (meaning the court decides your case can go forward because you have a valid argument), then the court will issue an OSC. An OSC directs the respondent (opposing party) to state any legal or factual reasons why the petitioner (you) should not be granted his or her request. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS ONCE THE COURT ORDERS AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE (OSC)?</div>
                <p class="text">The respondent (opposing party) must file a response, called a “return,” explaining reasons why your petition should not be granted. The respondent usually has 30 days to file a return.<sup><a href="#footnote-1015" id="footnote-ref-1015">[1015]</a></sup> </p>
                <div class="questionheading">IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I HAVE TO DO ONCE THE RESPONDENT FILES A “RETURN?”</div>
                <p class="text">Once the respondent files their “return,” you should file a “Denial and Exception to the Return.” In your Denial (also called a “traverse”), you should deny any and all false allegations made by the respondent in the return. You usually have 30 days to file your Denial with the court and serve the opposing party.</p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS AFTER “RETURNS” AND “DENIALS” ARE FILED—THE HEARING?</div>
                <p class="text">After the respondent files a “Return” and you file your “Denial,” the court has 30 days to decide whether or not to order an evidentiary hearing. The court only has to grant a hearing if it thinks there is a reasonable likelihood that you may be entitled to relief. If you are granted a hearing, both you and the opposing party will have the opportunity to present evidence. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHEN HAPPENS AFTER THE HEARING?</div>
                <p class="text">At the end of the hearing, the court will decide whether or not to grant you the request made in your habeas petition. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT IF THE COURT DOES NOT GRANT A HEARING?</div>
                <p class="text">If the court decides not to grant an evidentiary hearing, then the court will decide whether or not to grant your habeas appeal based off: your petition, the respondent’s Return, and your Denial. If the court did not order a hearing, then it has 30 days after you filed your Denial to decide whether or not to grant your petition. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PETITION IS GRANTED?</div>
                <p class="text">If the court grants your petition, the respondent has the right to appeal within 60 days of the court’s ruling. If the respondent does appeal , he or she can request that the court’s order be “stayed”—meaning that it does not take effect while the appeal is pending. If the respondent does appeal, your case will next be heard by the Court of Appeal. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS IF MY PETITION IS DENIED? </div>
                <p class="text">If the Superior Court denies your appeal, you to not have the right to appeal. But, you can, however, file a new appeal with the Court of Appeal, following the same process as discussed above. </p>
                <div class="questionheading">WHAT HAPPENS IF THE COURT OF APPEAL DENIES MY PETITION?</div>
                <p class="text">If the Court of Appeal denies your petition, you can ask the California Supreme Court to her your case. You can do this by filing a petition for review with the California Supreme Court. If you file a petition for review, the entire record from your appeal in the Court of Appeal will be send to the Supreme Court. You also have the option of filing a new petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the Supreme Court—filing a new petition will start the process over again, and the record from your appeal at the Court of Appeal will not be included in your petition. If the California Supreme Court denies your petition, and your case involves any federal legal issues, you can file a new petition with the United States Supreme Court.

                <div class="questionheading">I AM CLASSIFIED AS A SEX OFFENDER and want TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER STATE. HOW CAN I DO THAT? </div>
                <p>You must meet the four basic eligibility requirements to transfer to another state that apply to all people, AND you must meet additional requirements that are specific to people classified as sex offenders.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1016" id="footnote-ref-1016">[1016]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p>The four basic eligibility requirements for anyone to transfer their supervision to another state are:</p>
                <ol class="text">You have 90 days (3 months) or more, or an undecided amount of time, left to serve on community supervision at the time your application is submitted to the state you wish to transfer to;You have a valid supervision plan;You have not had your parole revoked and have no pending parole revocation charges; ANDYou are a resident of the receiving state <em>OR</em>You have family that lives in the state who are willing and able to assist you, and you can find employment or another means of supporting yourself.<sup><a href="#footnote-1017" id="footnote-ref-1017">[1017]</a></sup></ol>
                <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot leave until the state receiving your application has approved the transfer request or issued reporting instructions.</p>
                <p>Follow these steps to request the transfer to a new state:</p>
                <p>STEP 1: Discuss your desire to transfer to a different state with your parole or probation officer.</p>
                <p>STEP 2: Satisfy the four basic eligibility criteria listed above. It’s up to the sending state to decide if you are eligible and can be approved for a transfer request.</p>
                <p>STEP 3: Complete an Application for Transfer.</p>
                <p>STEP 4: The sending state must send the state receiving your application the following:</p>
                <ol><li>assessment information, including sex offender specific assessments;</li><li>social history;</li><li>information relevant to criminal sexual behavior;</li><li>law enforcement report that provides the specific details of the sex offense;</li><li>victim information: including the name, gender, age and relationship to the offender, and the statement of the victim or victim’s representative;</li><li>the sending state’s current or recommended supervision and treatment plan.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1018" id="footnote-ref-1018">[1018]</a></sup></sup></li></ol>
                <p>STEP 5: The state receiving the application has 5 business days to review the proposed residence. If the proposed residence is not acceptable due to existing state law or policy, the receiving state may deny the application. No travel permit can be granted by the sending state until the receiving state says it can.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1019" id="footnote-ref-1019">[1019]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p class="text">STEP 6: A travel permit will be given to you by your parole or probation officer if the receiving state has approved the new residence. Travel permits are issued by the local probation or parole office, so each office uses a different form. Your parole or probation should give you this form once you have been approved by the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1020" id="footnote-ref-1020">[1020]</a></sup></sup> </p>

                <ol class="text">The Fresno County Probation Department has many types of formal probation programs to monitor your conduct. For example, if you have a drug problem, you could be referred to Drug Court, the PC1000 program, or the Probationers in Recovery program. Whatever the program or type of supervision, you are expected to obey the conditions of probation that were set by the Court.The frequency and method of contact with your Probation Officer depends on the seriousness of your commitment offense(s). In addition to special supervision programs, there are special programs—these are conditions of probation offered such as Work Furlough and Work Project. These special programs allow for consequences other than custody in jail for a felony or misdemeanor conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1022" id="footnote-ref-1022">[1022]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Butte County:</p>

Probation Officers utilize routine drug and alcohol tests, office appointments, and treatment program partnership to ensure compliance with terms and conditions of probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1023" id="footnote-ref-1023">[1023]</a></sup> </ol>

Please, make sure to keep your appointment and be on time. If you cannot make your appointment, you must call the day before to re-schedule.<strong><strong>STEP 4:</strong></strong> Most likely than not the Court would have ordered for you to attend a counseling or rehabilitation program. You along with your officer will choose which programs better meet your needs. It is important that you contact the program and arrange for an intake session.<strong><strong>STEP 5:</strong></strong> Stay out of trouble! We know you’re facing a lot of challenges and difficulties getting your life back together, but if you need help or support, call your officer before you do something that put you back in jail.</p>

                <p class="text">For those supervised by county-level probation, below are the steps for requesting a change to your conditions of formal or informal probation.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Draft the Motion and Supporting Documents:</h4>
                <ol class="text">There is no official court form for this motion. You may contact the Court Clerk in the local county superior court where you were convicted to ask if there is a local form for this purpose. Most likely there is not, so you or your attorney will have to draft an original motion. Your motion should consist of the following parts:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1029" id="footnote-ref-1029">[1029]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">(1) <span class="emphasisitalic">Notice of Motion</span>: This tells the court what you want it to do. In other words, it notifies the court that you want it to modify your probation conditions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1030" id="footnote-ref-1030">[1030]</a></sup></sup>(2) <span class="emphasisitalic">Memorandum of Points and Authorities</span>: This section explains the law or authority that you are relying on for your request, as well as the facts supporting your request under that law or authority.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1031" id="footnote-ref-1031">[1031]</a></sup></sup>In the case of a disability, you should include the following: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),<sup><a href="#footnote-1032" id="footnote-ref-1032">[1032]</a></sup> California Government Code § 11135, Civil Code §§ 54 et seq., California Penal Code § 1203.3 and the specific facts of your disability, how it affects you on probation, and what changes or additional assistance you need.(3) <span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration</span>: This is your signed, sworn statement of the facts used in your memorandum. It must include all of the facts used to support your motion.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1033" id="footnote-ref-1033">[1033]</a></sup></sup> (4) <span class="emphasisitalic">Any Supporting Documentation</span>: If you have any documentation, such as a doctor’s letter or prescription for medication, you should include these.</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">TIP:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Try and get to the Clerk’s office early, because there may be long lines. Make sure to bring lots of copies and a friend to help if you can. </p>
                <p class="text">(5) <span class="emphasisitalic">Proposed Order</span>: This is the document the judge signs to grant your motion and officially allow your probation to be terminated.(6) <span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service</span>: Include the Proof of Service form with your motion. This document must be included with all your court papers to prove that you gave a copy of the court papers to every person who is required by law to get them. <em>Need help with your court forms?</em> Ask the attorney/ Public Defender from your case, the court’s Self-Help Center, or your local law library for assistance with your motion. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you had public defender for your case, many Public Defender offices will write, file, and argue motions to modify probation on your behalf. Call you public defender to find out whether they are able to assist you in filing and arguing your motion. </p>
                <h4 class="step">File the Motion</h4>
                <ol class="text">Once your motion is drafted, you should make at least 4 copies—an original copy for the court, one copy for the District Attorney, one for the Probation Department, and one for you to keep. The court clerk will keep the original copy for the court’s file. Bring the original motion and all copies to the clerk who will stamp all the documents with the date you are filing these documents. The clerk will give you back your copy, plus any copies that need to be served on the other parties. Remember to make sure that the clerk stamps each of these copies! Be sure to confirm with the clerk if the clerk’s office will serve the District Attorney and the Probation Department, or if you are responsible for doing that. If the clerk gives you back more than just your own copy, it most likely means that you are responsible for service! (See STEP 3 below).</ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">If you are requesting a change in your probation conditions due to a disability:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">During the hearing, you (or your attorney, if you have one) will explain to the judge why your disability makes it difficult for you to comply with your current conditions, what changes you need in your probation conditions, and if you need any other assistance from the probation department to successfully complete your probation. You can also ask the court to order the probation department to provide certain assistance or other accommodations. The prosecutor will also have a chance to speak, including a chance to oppose your request for modification. For more information on disabilities, please see PG. 269.</p>
                <ol class="text">FEES/ COST: Be aware that there are always fees associated with filing documents with the court. These fees will vary by county, and you can request a fee waiver if you qualify. Check with the clerk for your county’s fee schedule and waiver request process. Note: if you had a public defender on your case, you also may be eligible to receive a fee waiver for court filing fees. </ol>
                <p class="text">After your motion has been filed, the clerk will give you a court date to have your motion heard by the judge.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Serve the Motion on the Other Parties</h4>
                <ol class="text">If the clerk indicates that you are responsible for “service,” this means that you must make sure that all necessary people (called necessary “parties”) get a copy of the motion in the proper manner. The law requires that you give the District Attorney at least 2 days’ notice of your motion (or 5 days if your case involves domestic violence).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1034" id="footnote-ref-1034">[1034]</a></sup></sup> This means that the DA must have a copy of your motion at 2 two days before the date of your hearing. It is best to serve the motion on all necessary people (parties) right after you file it. Be sure to have the DA’s office stamp the copy of your motion that you are keeping for yourself too—this serves as your proof that you served the DA with your motion. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4>
                <ol class="text">When you file your motion, the clerk will give you a court date for your motion to be heard by a judge. You will have to attend the hearing if you are not being represented by an attorney. In most cases, even if you are being represented by an attorney, you will want to be present to show your respect to the judge and the court process. The judge is unlikely to modify your probation unless it thinks that you are taking your probation seriously—and going to your court date shows the judge that you care about your case!<sup><a href="#footnote-1035" id="footnote-ref-1035">[1035]</a></sup> If the judge grants your motion or modifies your probation conditions in any other way, he or she must state the reasons for doing so on the record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1036" id="footnote-ref-1036">[1036]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <div class="questionheading">HOW CAN I REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION OR FILE A COMPLAINT IF I FEEL THAT county PROBATION IS NOT ACCOMMODATING MY DISABILITY, OR IF my disability is preventing me from ACCESSing PROBATION SERVICES OR PROGRAMS?</div>
                <p>Unlike for state parole, there are no formal probation policies or procedures to request accommodations or file a complaint related to your disability. Each county does things differently, and many counties have no formal procedures. You can first talk to your probation officer and explain the situation to him/her OR you may ask a judge to modify your probation to accommodate your disability by filing a motion requesting a change. </p>
                <h4 class="step">Start by talking with your probation officer and explain to him/her:</h4>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>What your disability is;Why it is difficult for you to participate in programs or supervision requirements; andWhat assistance, accommodations or changes you need. If you have to do any evaluations with other agencies or service providers (for example, if the Probation Department does a risk- or needs-assessment for you, or you have a work placement evaluation by the Sheriff’s department), you should also explain to them why your disability makes it difficult for you to participate or meet other requirements.<em>If you were sentenced under Realignment and are on Mandatory Supervision or PRCS,</em> you may be entitled to participate in special programs or other services for your disability.<sup><a href="#footnote-1039" id="footnote-ref-1039">[1039]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <h4 class="step">If that didn’t fix the problem, you can ask the judge to modify your probation to accommodate your disability by filing a motion requesting a change (called a “modification”). </h4>
                <p>If after talking to your probation officer or their supervisor, you still need help because (1) you did not get the assistance you require for your disability, (2) you are unable to participate in the programs which you are being offered or required to participate in, or (3) the terms of your supervision are difficult for you due to your disability, then you can go back to court to request help from the judge. </p>
                <p>In order to ask the judge to modify your probation, you must FILE A MOTION requesting that the judge modify probation to accommodate your disability. Once you file your motion, you will have a hearing. </p>
                <p>Remember, that your motion requesting modification of your probation should include mention of the following laws: </p>
                <ol class="text">The Americans with Disability Act (ADA)—The ADA protects people with disabilities against discrimination and it requires public entities to provide reasonable accommodations. The ADA applies to all public entities, including local courts and probation departments.<sup><a href="#footnote-1040" id="footnote-ref-1040">[1040]</a></sup>California Government Code § 11135 and Civil Code §§ 54 et seq.,<sup><a href="#footnote-1041" id="footnote-ref-1041">[1041]</a></sup> which provide similar state protections as the federal ADA.California Penal Code § 1203.3, which gives the court authority to change your probation conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1042" id="footnote-ref-1042">[1042]</a></sup>The specific facts of your disability, how it affects you on probation, and what changes or additional assistance you need. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4>
                <p>During the hearing, you (or your attorney, if you have one) will explain to the judge why your disability makes it difficult for you to comply with your current conditions, what changes you need in your probation conditions, and if you need any other assistance from the probation department will help you to successfully complete your probation. You can also ask the court to order the probation department to provide certain assistance or other accommodations. The prosecutor will also have a chance to speak at your hearing—this includes a chance to oppose your request for modification. </p>
                <p>Because the judge has much more control over the Probation Department and the terms of your supervision, the Judge can order Probation to provide you with assistance, and can decide any other accommodations that are necessary for you to successfully complete your supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-1043" id="footnote-ref-1043">[1043]</a></sup> </p>

                <p>You will likely be ordered to follow most if not all of the following rules (conditions), or something very similar to these:</p>
                <ol><li>You cannot leave the limits of your judicial district (meaning the area that the court has jurisdiction—i.e. the “Southern District o California”) without written permission from the court or your probation officer.<sup> </sup></li><li>You must file a written report with your probation officer within the first 5 days of each month, or as directed by your probation officer.</li><li>You must truthfully answer any questions and follow any instructions that your probation officer asks of you.</li><li>You must meet your family responsibilities, primarily paying any court-ordered child support or support for the parent with whom your child is living.</li><li>You must work regularly at a lawful occupation, unless your U.S. probation officer excuses you for school, training, or other reasons the officer finds acceptable.</li><li>You must notify your probation officer at least 10 days before you change your address (some officers will require more or less notice, so check your conditions).</li><li>You cannot drink alcoholic beverages to excess. You cannot use or distribute illegal drugs, or frequent places where others use or distribute drugs.</li><li>You cannot associate with people engaged in criminal activity. (This means you cannot hang out with or spend time with people who are committing crimes.) </li><li>You cannot associate with anyone convicted of a felony unless your U.S. probation officer gives you permission to do so. (Again, this means that unless your probation officer says differently, you are not allowed to hang out with or spend time with someone who has been convicted of a felony. Just spending time with someone who has been convicted of a felony can be considered a violation of your probation, even if you were not doing anything else wrong.) </li><li>You must let your probation officer to visit you any time at home or elsewhere.</li><li>You must let your probation officer to take any contraband that he or she finds in plain view around you.</li><li>You must get in touch with your U.S. probation officer within 3 days (72 hours) if you’re arrested or questioned by law enforcement (again, some officers will require you to report faster, so check your conditions).</li><li>You cannot serve as an informant to law enforcement without court permission.</li><li>As directed by your U.S. probation officer, you must notify other people about any risks that your criminal record, personal history or characteristics might pose; and you must allow your U.S. probation officer to notify people of any risks posed by your criminal record, personal history or characteristics.</li><li>You must pay any court-ordered “special assessment” and fines, and follow any court-ordered payment plan set up for you. </li><li>You must notify your U.S. probation officer if there is any significant change in your income or economic circumstances which would impact how much you can pay towards any unpaid restitution, fines, or special assessments (NOTE: this is a mandatory condition for people on federal probation, and a recommended “standard condition” for people on Supervised Release).</li></ol>

                <p>Once you have a release date from the Parole Commission (USPC), you must complete a satisfactory plan for parole supervision to actually get released. The Regional Commissioner may change your date of release (earlier or later) onto parole to allow more time for release planning. At most, the Regional Commissioner can delay your release onto parole for 120 days; otherwise, you have the right to a hearing if the Regional Commissioner wants to push back your release date more than 120 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-1062" id="footnote-ref-1062">[1062]</a></sup></p>

                <h4 class="step">Investigation Phase</h4>
                <p>Your U.S. Probation Officer will do an investigation to make sure that the person’s release plan is appropriate. This investigation will start with the probation officer asking you questions about your release plan. The probation officer will then follow up and verify your answers. For example, if you told the probation officer that your approved residence did not have any persons with a felony record, the probation officer will follow-up to make sure this is true. </p>

                <p>After the Parole Commission approves your release plan, and a U.S. Probation Officer completes an investigation, you will be released on the date set by the Parole Commission (unless there is misconduct or some other reason leading to a change in the date). </p>
