  <p>
    I gave birth while incarcerated. How do I connect with my child after I am released?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your release date or parole date falls within 6-8 weeks after you deliver your baby, you should be given family planning services while you are incarcerated.[2406] Family planning services include referrals to physicians or community agencies and encouragement to enroll in life education classes.[2407]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What can I do to show that I am able to parent my child after my release? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Using a notebook, keep a record of all the things you did while incarcerated to prepare yourself to take care of your child in reentry. If you need to go to court after you are released, these types of records won’t prove to a judge that you are immediately ready to take over parenting, but they will help to show the judge that you tried to stay involved with the events in your child’s life, maintain a positive, loving relationship with your child, and work on improving yourself—all things that help your chances to reconnect with your child through the court system.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Keep track of the following:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All requests for visitation—even ones where your child’s caregiver refused to allow the visit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any educational programs you participate in, like parenting classes or vocational classes, and the dates for every class you attend. Try to collect any documents to show proof of attendance, certificates of completion, or awards you received. These will help to show a judge how hard you worked while incarcerated to be prepared as a parent after your release.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A record of what you have done while incarcerated to keep track of your child and his/her development and well-being. For example, write down the dates and times you called your child and/or the child’s caregiver, received a call, or visited with your child and/or your child’s caregiver. Also keep track of the letters you sent—and ask for updates about your child, like his or her health, report card, physical, social and emotional development, and overall well-being.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Save any letters or pictures you receive from your child’s caregiver while you are incarcerated.

    VISITATION RESTRICTIONS FOR CURRENTLY INCARCERATED PARENTS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted of certain crimes[2408] involving a minors, the CDCR may prohibit or place restrictions on your ability to see your children while you are incarcerated. [2409] This flow chart summarizes the CDCR’s visitation policies for people convicted of the following child-related offenses:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    how do i get a court order to reinstate visitation WITH MY CHILD?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted of certain offenses involving your own child, the CDCR may not allow your child to visit at all. To try to resintate visitation privileges, you can request a court hearing to determine whether visitation is in your child’s best interests.[2410] If the court finds in your favor, you may be able to have non-contact visits with your child.[2411] The court in which you must file depends on the status of your parental rights, among other factors. Legal Services for Prisoners with Children’s Child Custody and Visiting Rights Manual for Incarcerated Parents[2412] has more information about reinstating visitation.

    I WAS ARRESTED FOR A CHILD-RELATED OFFENSE BUT NOT CONVICTED. CAN MY CHILD VISIT ME IN JAIL OR PRISON?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were arrested for one of the offenses listed in the flow charts above, your visiting status is unrestricted UNLESS the classification committee at your institution has determined that you could present a threat to minor visitors.[2413] The classification committee makes these decisions on a case-by-case basis, considering information from arrest reports, court transcripts, and other official documents.[2414] If the classification committee finds that such visits could be dangerous or harmful, you will be restricted to non-contact visits with your child.[2415] You can appeal the committee’s decision by filing an inmate grievance (Form 602).[2416] For more information on filing a 602, go to PG.
