  <p>
    I have a disability. What rights do I have on federal probation or parole to have accommodations for my disability?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects individuals on federal probation/federal parole from discrimination due to their disabilities.[992] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Rehabilitation Act provides essentially the same protections as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including the right to reasonable changes in policies, rules, and conditions; equal opportunity to participate in programs, services, and benefits; and additional assistance (services or devices) so that you can participate in programs and activities related to your supervision.[993] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thus, federal probation staff must offer you the same types of accommodations and services discussed for state parole under “State Parole: Disabilities and the ADA,” see PG. 198.
