  <p>
    What rights do I have during a probation revocation hearing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are minimal due process requirements for probation revocation proceedings.[720] This means that you don’t have all of the same rights that you have at trial.[721] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have the following rights:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Written notice of the alleged violations and the possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain mitigating evidence (meaning evidence that would lessen the perceived severity of the violation or help justify it);[722]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Disclosure of the evidence against you;[723]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Timely hearing of the charges at a probable cause hearing and a formal revocation hearing;[724]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The right to present witnesses and evidence.[725] You can subpoena and present witnesses and evidence.[726] A person served with a subpoena for a parole revocation hearing is required to appear at the hearing unless the hearing is held at a place outside the county of his or her residence and more than 75 miles from his or her residence;[727]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.[728] You have a conditional right under the U.S. and California constitutions to confront witnesses whose statements are used against you in a probation violation hearing.[729] This means that you or your attorney may cross-examine any people who gave information or testified that you violated your probation.[730] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A fair and unbiased hearing body;[731] and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A written statement of the decision, the evidence relied on, and the reasons for revoking parole.[732]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: You may waive (give up) your rights, either expressly—by saying you give up the right, or by implication—by failing to assert the right.[733] Therefore, it is important that you take advantage of your rights and complain if a right is violated.
