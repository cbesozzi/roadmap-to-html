  <h2><a href="/housing/short-term-housing-overview/shelters/what-may-i-need-to-get-to-be-accepted-into-transit/index.html">What may I need to get to be accepted into transitional housing?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What may I need to get to be accepted into transitional housing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends—each program has different requirements. You might need: identification (learn how to get different types of identification in the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING, beginning on PG. 21); proof of homelessness; proof of any income; proof of your sobriety; police clearance; to get through the waitlist; to have an interview; etc. It’s best to CALL (or if you’re currently incarcerated, ask a family member or friend to call, or WRITE the program a letter with your request) to find out well in advance of when you want to move exactly what you need to do and what the requirements are!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Special needs housing—short- or long-term
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are also housing programs for people with specific needs such as sober living environments that offer addiction treatment and recovery, safety from domestic violence, assisted living for people with disabilities or mental health needs, housing programs for women with children, veterans, and 290 sex offender registrants. These are often transitional housing programs that are for a short term only; others are intended to be long-term/permanent housing for people with special needs. For more information on special needs housing, see PG. 385. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PRE-RELEASE Transitional housing programs:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The term “pre-release transitional housing” refers to a group of CDCR-sponsored programs that allow certain individuals to carry out the last part of their sentence living in a regulated community environment controlled by corrections. Such programs generally provide for greater freedom than is allowed in institutional settings. Individuals living in CDCR’s pre-release transitional housing are no longer incarcerated in the traditional sense, but remain under CDCR’s jurisdiction and control. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Each program has a different duration, application process, and set of eligibility criteria. However, all are voluntary – meaning you must submit an application to CDCR staff if you are interested in participating –and require that you have anywhere from a month to several years left in your sentence. Thus, if you’re currently incarcerated, you may wish to speak to a correctional counselor as soon as possible to find out which programs may be available to you. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What types of pre-release transitional housing programs does CDCR offer? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CDCR currently offers five pre-release housing programs: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Male Community Reentry Program (MCRP)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Custody to Community Transitional Reentry Program (CCTRP) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Community Prison Mothers Program (CPMP)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Female Community Reentry Facility (FCRF)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Community Alternative Custody Program (ACP)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The details of each of these programs are summarized in APPENDIX {} ON PG. {}. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What HAPPENS TO MY GOOD TIME CREDITS IF I SERVE THE LAST PART OF MY SENTENCE IN A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In January 2010, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law (SB X3-18) authorizing CDCR to reduce people’s length of incarceration if they reach certain rehabilitative program milestones—a reward known as “good time credits”. Because a person is still under CDCR custody at a pre-release transitional housing placement, any good time credits already earned should not change. In addition to applying the good time credits you have already earned toward a shorter sentence, you can continue earning credits while participating in CDCR’s pre-release transitional housing programs as well. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m a lifer. Can I participate in CDCR’s pre-release transitional housing programs?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lifers are not able to participate in pre-release transitional housing programs right now. This is because placement in these programs requires a firm sense of your release date, and the current parole system makes it difficult to know a lifer’s release date in advance. The CDCR plans to roll out lifer-only transitional programs in 2017 that would closely mirror the programs described here. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are there waitlists to get into these programs?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As of the most recent publication of this resource, there are no waitlists to get into any pre-release transitional housing programs. However, this could change as these programs become more popular. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have children. If I participate in these programs, can they live with me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Community Prisoner Mother Program and Female Community Reentry Facility both allow children to live on site with their mothers. The Alternative Custody Program is individually tailored, but may allow children to live on site with their mothers OR fathers, or else facilitate regular visitation between parent and child. For more information, see the summaries in APPENDIX [] ON PG. [].
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some of these programs are gender-specific. What if I identify as transgender or gender-variant?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The CDCR has outlined its protocol for housing people who identify as trans* in Department Operations Manual (DOM) section 62080.14. If you feel your housing assignment does not match your gender identity, you must go through a diagnostic process with a doctor, then provide documentation of your diagnosis on CDCR Form 128-C3. After you take these steps, a CDCR classification committee will review your case to determine the most appropriate institutional placement and housing assignment under the circumstances. You may also have to file a 602 grievance if you feel your housing needs are not being met. For more information on the 602 grievance process, see PG. X.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although the Department Operations Manual does not specifically address transitional housing placement for trans* and gender-variant people, a representative from TGI Justice Project, which advocates for currently and formerly incarcerated people who identify as transgender, gender variant, or intersex, noted that many reentry programs are not trans-friendly. If you are interested in joining a transitional housing program but have questions or concerns based on your gender identity, please contact the free Root & Rebound Reentry Legal Hotline at 510-279-4662, which operates every Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
