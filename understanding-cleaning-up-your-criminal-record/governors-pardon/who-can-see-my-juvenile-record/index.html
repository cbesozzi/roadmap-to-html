  <p>
    Who can see my juvenile record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under the law, juvenile court and police records are usually confidential and NOT visible to the public or other people, except in certain cases.[3135] Also, juvenile cases are considered “adjudications”—NOT “convictions”—so legally, you can say that you have NO convictions from your juvenile cases.[3136]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, juvenile records sometimes DO show up on background checks, and certain employers such as law enforcement and health care agencies are allowed to ask about unsealed juvenile records.[3137]  BUT once your juvenile record is sealed, NO one can see it. All juvenile records kept by the court, DOJ, probation department, and other law enforcement agencies are sealed, and it’s as if your case never happened.[3138]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “Convictions as an adult”:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A conviction as an adult means you were charged as an adult in criminal court (NOT in juvenile court) and convicted (either by plea bargain or trial).
