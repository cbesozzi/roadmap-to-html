<h1>Your Rights When a Private Landlord Runs a Criminal Background Check</h1>

<h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153171"></a>Your Rights When a Private Landlord Runs a Criminal Background Check</h3>

<p class="text">As an applicant to private housing, you have legal rights related to the information that comes up in a private background check, and how a private landlord may use it. The law protects you by making it illegal for certain types of information to be included in a criminal background check (also called a “tenant report,” or in California, a “consumer report”) on you. But there are a lot of laws that limit what a private background check company creating a tenant report for a landlord can share with them.</p>

  <p>
    What must a private landlord do if they want to get a background check/tenant report on me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under state and federal law, you have the right to the following protections if a private landlord runs a background check on you:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Landlord Must Give You “Notice” & Get Written Permission to Run a Background Check: This means that you must receive a written document (“notice”) from the landlord saying that s/he wishes to conduct a background check on you. The landlord must get your written permission before getting the background check.[1172]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Give the Applicant a Copy of the Background Check: Within 3 days of receiving the background check report, the landlord must provide you with a copy.[1173] In California, you also have the right to request a copy of your report for at least 2 years after the background check company provides your report to the landlord (or anyone else who requests the report).[1174]

  <p>
    What information cannot be included in a private background check/tenant report in California?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following information cannot show up in a private background check report in California:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lawsuits or judgments from more than 7 years ago;[1175] 
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any information about referrals to, or participation in, any pre-trial or post-trial diversion programs (court-mandated programs which function as a form of alternative sentencing);

  <p>
    Do private background check companies have to make sure the information they report to a landlord in a tenant report is true and accurate?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. Private background check companies (called “Credit Reporting Agencies” in California) CANNOT include “public record” information unless it has been double-checked for accuracy in the past 30 days. Public record information includes arrests, convictions, civil actions, tax liens, and outstanding judgments.

  <p>
    Does a private landlord have to tell me that the criminal record information that showed up in a private background check/tenant report is the reason I am not getting the apartment?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes! The landlord has to tell you if your criminal history is the reason you are not getting the apartment. If there is a negative action taken—like not renting you the apartment—because of a background report, the landlord must follow this 2-step procedure:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 1: The landlord must provide you with a copy of the report and a copy of the Federal Trade Commission Summary of Rights before the negative action is taken—giving you an opportunity to clear up any inaccuracies in the report.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    STEP 2: If the landlord goes forward with the negative action, it must provide you notice about the adverse decision, the contact information of the reporting agency, a statement that the landlord (and not the screening company) made the adverse decision; and your right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of the report.[1180]
