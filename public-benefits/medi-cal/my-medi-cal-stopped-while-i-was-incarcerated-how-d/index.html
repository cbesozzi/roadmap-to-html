  <p>
    My Medi-Cal stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart it?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on when you first became incarcerated, and when your release date is/was. California law on this has recently changed, and different rules started to apply on January 1, 2014.[1471] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The old rule. If you were incarcerated before January 1, 2014: If you were on Medi-Cal prior to your incarceration, then your Medi-Cal was ended on the day that you entered jail or prison. This means if you wanted to get Medi-Cal again, you had to reapply, get approved, and wait until your release before you could receive health care coverage through Medi-Cal. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The new rule. If you were incarcerated anytime after January 1, 2014: If you were on Medi-Cal prior to your incarceration, then your Medi-Cal got automatically suspended (paused) on the day that you entered jail or prison. The suspension period is set to last 1 year. This means that:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re released before 1 year passes, AND you continue to meet all other eligibility requirements, your Medi-Cal should automatically restart on the day of your release (and you don’t need to reapply).[1472]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re still incarcerated after 1 year passes, then your Medi-Cal coverage will end—and if you want to get Medi-Cal again, you’ll need to reapply to restart your coverage after your release.[1473] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you qualified for Medi-Cal through SSI, you may need to restart your SSI benefits (see PG. 615) before you can get your Medi-Cal coverage back.[1474]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I believe my Medi-Cal was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If and when the Medi-Cal office decides to suspend or end your Medi-Cal coverage, it must send you a “Notice of Action” explaining this decision.[1475] If you disagree with the decision and want to appeal (challenge) it, read the back of the Notice for instructions about how to request a hearing.
