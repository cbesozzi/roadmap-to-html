  Your Rights Against Illegal Denials from Government-Assisted Housing Because of Your Criminal Record
</p>

<p>
  What does “CURRENTLY POSING A THREAT” mean?
</p>

<p>
  If you are denied government-assisted housing by a PHA or owner because of criminal activity that DOES NOT threaten anyone’s health, safety, peace, or property, then you have a strong argument to challenge the denial. Go to PG. 408 of this chapter to learn how. Many advocates argue that certain crimes—like prostitution, DUIs, & shoplifting—should not disqualify you because they do not pose any threat to others. The PHA or owner must base his/her decision to deny you on a “reasonable belief” that the criminal activity would threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of others.
