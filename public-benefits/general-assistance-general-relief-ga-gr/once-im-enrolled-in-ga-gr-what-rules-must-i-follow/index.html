          <h3><a id="_Toc290125857"></a><a id="_Toc448153267"></a>Once I’m enrolled in GA/GR, what rules must I follow to stay eligible?</h3>
          <p class="text">It depends on your county.<em> </em>Every county sets its own General Assistance/ General Relief rules. Here are some of the rules to know about:</p>
          <ol class="text">Generally, you must fall under the income and property limits to be eligible. </ol>
          <ol class="text">All counties require you to immediately report<em> any</em> changes to your address, income, or property. Failure to report such changes can result in your losing the GA/GR benefits, even if the change would not otherwise disqualify you. </ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">MORE INFORMATION ON “UNEMPLOYABLE APPLICANTS”</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">You may be considered unemployable if you are: older than 70 years old; responsible for the substantial and continuous care of a family member; or you are disabled.</p>
          <ul class="sidebox">Unemployable GA/GR recipients who are applying for Social Security or SSI can also receive representation or assistance in their applications.Contact your county welfare agency if you need to find out exactly what benefits and services it offers and which rules apply for General Assistance/General Relief. </ul>
          <ol class="text">Some counties may limit how long you can receive GA/GR if you able to work, or require that you apply for Social Security and/ or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if you are <em>not</em> able to work. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Some counties treat GA/GR as a “loan,” and will make you pay back the GA/GR money you received if you have enough income, get a job, or get approved for SSDI or SSI disability benefits.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Some counties also provide you and/or require you to use employment services to help you find, get, and keep a job. But you can’t be required to join and use employment services if you are “unemployable.” You may be considered unemployable if you are: older than 70 years old; responsible for the substantial and continuous care of a family member; or you are disabled. If you have not been screened by the county welfare agency to determine if you are employable, or you believe the county has made a mistake in determining that you are “employable,” and you have been required to participate in an employment program or denied GA/GR assistance, you should consider appealing. It’s best to contact your local legal aid provider to help with filing your appeal (you can visit the website <a href="http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help">http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help</a> to browse legal aid providers, and see list of legal aid providers at the back of this guide on PG. 1286).<sup><a href="#footnote-1373" id="footnote-ref-1373">[1343]</a></sup></ol>
