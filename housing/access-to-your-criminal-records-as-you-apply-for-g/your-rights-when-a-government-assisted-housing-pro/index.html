          <h3><a id="_Toc448153191"></a>What are tenant screening reports?</h3>
          <p class="text">As discussed on PG. 426, a tenant screening report is a background check done by a private company or credit bureau on a housing applicant. It reports credit information, employment history, certain criminal history information, entries on sex offender registers and/or other public databases, driving records, and more. A tenant report may also include information gathered from personal interviews with your neighbors, former landlords, or coworkers.</p>

          <h3><a id="_Toc448153195"></a>Do I have any rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing rejects my rental application because of a background check/ tenant report?</h3>
          <p><strong><em>Yes.</em> The PHA or landlord must give you an “adverse action” notice letting you know it plans to take an action that could harm you based on information that showed up in your tenant report/background check.</strong><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1234" id="footnote-ref-1234">[1204]</a></sup></sup></span><strong> The notice must include the following information:</strong></p>
          <ol class="text">The name and contact for the company that supplied the report;</ol>
          <ol class="text">A statement that the landlord, not the screening company, made the adverse decision; <em>and</em></ol>
          <ol class="text">Notice of your right to dispute the accuracy of the report and to receive a free copy of your report within 60 days.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1235" id="footnote-ref-1235">[1205]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
          <p><strong>EXTRA PROTECTIONS for the Public Housing program and the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program<em> ONLY</em>:</strong></p>
          <p class="textbox"><em>ONLY for these two government-assisted programs, PHAs must follow certain extra rules (set forth below). </em></p>
          <ul class="textbox">The PHA must make sure the criminal records are true and accurate.</ul>
          <p class="textbox">After the PHA has you sign a <em>release</em> of criminal records information and submits that release to the law enforcement agency that holds the criminal records, it may receive a response that there is a match based on your name, date of birth, and social security number. The PHA cannot deny admission based on this information alone; the PHA must verify the match with a positive fingerprint comparison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1236" id="footnote-ref-1236">[1206]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <ul class="textbox">The PHA must give you notice of any proposed action that could harm you.</ul>
          <p class="textbox">A PHA must notify the household of any proposed action that could harm you (called an “adverse action” notice). The PHA must also provide a copy of the criminal record information to the person who was the subject of the record—as well as to the applicant, if that’s a different person.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1237" id="footnote-ref-1237">[1207]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <ul class="textbox">The PHA must give you an opportunity to challenge the criminal record information. </ul>
          <p class="textbox">The person whose information was relied on must be given an opportunity to dispute the proposed negative action.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1238" id="footnote-ref-1238">[1208]</a></sup></sup> NOTE: Even if you don’t have an automatic legal right to a review hearing, you can always ask for one! To learn more about challenging a denial to government-assisted housing, please go to PG. 408.</p>
          <ul class="textbox">The PHA Must Protect the Confidentiality of Your Records:<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1239" id="footnote-ref-1239">[1209]</a></sup></sup></span> </ul>
          <p class="textbox">Under federal law, PHAs must have a system to: (1) Protect the confidentiality of applicants’ criminal records; (2) Guard against improper sharing of those records; AND<em> </em>(3) Destroy the records once<em> </em>their purpose has been achieved.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1240" id="footnote-ref-1240">[1210]</a></sup></sup></p>

          <h3><a id="_Toc448153196"></a>What are my legal rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing illegally accesses or uses my criminal record information?</h3>
          <p class="text"><em>THE GENERAL RULE: </em></p>
          <p class="text">In general, if you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG. 417) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to PG. 408 of this Chapter to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.</p>
          <p><strong><em>SPECIAL RULE for Public Housing &amp; “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher programs:</em></strong></p>
          <p class="text">If you applied through a PHA for Public Housing or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers, there is a special rule that says PHAs and owners of the government-assisted housing cannot take any “negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with” the laws and regulations governing access to your criminal records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1241" id="footnote-ref-1241">[1211]</a></sup></sup> A negligent action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing knew or should have known that their access to your records violated the law. A knowing action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing <em>actually knew</em> that its access to your records violated the law. </p>
          <p class="text">A PHA or owner MAY BE LIABLE for negligence if they do any of the following:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1242" id="footnote-ref-1242">[1212]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">Improperly disclose a criminal record;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Improperly use a consent form (a.k.a. a “release” form); </ol>
          <ol class="text">Fail to <em>notify you</em> of the criminal history information collected; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Fail to <em>provide you</em> with a copy of the information collected (whether you are an applicant or a current tenant); <em>and/or</em></ol>
          <ol class="text">Fail to <em>allow you the right to dispute</em> the information. </ol>
          <p class="text">In this situation, it’s best to talk to a lawyer! You could recover attorney’s fees and other litigation costs as part of the relief you get in court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1243" id="footnote-ref-1243">[1213]</a></sup></sup> See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1286 to contact an organization that may be able to provide you legal assistance. </p>
