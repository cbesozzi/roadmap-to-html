                <p class="description">The BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER explains how to access the building blocks of reentry including: how to get identification (ID) &amp; other key documents, voting rights, and Selective Service registration. ID is proof of who you are—your identity. Government agencies, workplaces, service providers, schools, and other institutions issue ID cards for people who are members. You will want ID and other key documents so that you can participate in all the services that your community has to offer, so you can legally drive, and to prove who you are. Voting is another building block of reentry—learn about your voting rights in this Chapter. Finally, Selective Service registration for the military is required of most men in the U.S.—learn why it is important to reentry in this Chapter.</p>
                <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

                <h2><a id="I_Introduction"></a><a id="_Toc448152648"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152649"></a>What is identification (ID) and why is it important?</h3>
                <p class="text">Identification (“ID”) is proof of who you are—your <em>identity</em>. Government agencies, workplaces, service providers, schools, and other institutions issue ID cards for people who are members. Many forms of ID include a photo and important information about you, such as your address or physical characteristics. Having an ID is important because, when you sign up for various programs, licenses, and services, you’ll have to show an ID to prove that you are who you say you are, and to show that you qualify for whatever you’re signing up for. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152650"></a>Why do I need identification (ID)?</h3>
                <p class="text">You need specific forms of ID to apply for many important resources and services, including housing, employment, education, medical care, public benefits, transportation, driving privileges, voting, banking, and licenses that allow you to work in certain types of jobs.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152651"></a>I have a prison or jail ID. Isn’t that enough to identify myself?</h3>
                <p class="text">You may already have a prison or jail ID card, but these generally are not enough to help you prove who you are in all the areas you will need an official ID. At the start of your reentry, though, a prison or jail ID card may help you get other forms of ID. </p>
                <a id="_Toc448152652"></a>
                <h3>What are the most important forms of ID for me to have? </h3>
                <h4 class="sidebox">NATURALIZED U.S. CITIZEN?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If you were born outside of the U.S. and then became a citizen, instead of a getting a birth certificate, you need your naturalization certificate, for more details, go to PG. 39.</p>
                <p class="text">As you rebuild your life in the community, there are 3 KEY DOCUMENTS for you to have: (1) your birth certificate; (2) your Social Security Card (or Number); and (3) a State ID or Driver License (don't need both, just one). The most important forms of ID for you to have first are your birth certificate and Social Security Number (SSN). Once you have these, you will be able to get a State ID card or a Driver License, the most commonly used forms of ID for everyday purposes. Once in a while, you will need to show a copy of your Social Security Card for certain services, but most of the time if you just know your Social Security Number (SSN), that’s enough.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152653"></a>I don’t have any ID right now. Where would be the best place to start &amp; when is the best time?</h3>
                <h5 class="question">Where would be the best place to start? </h5>
                <p class="answer">If you don’t have any of the 3 KEY ID DOCUMENTS—your Birth Certificate, a Social Security Card (or Number), a State ID or Driver License—you will have trouble proving your identity.If you do not have ANY of the 3 documents, it’s likely best to <em>get your birth certificate first, then your Social Security Card, and lastly your CA State ID or Driver License</em>. To learn more about these 3 key documents:</p>
                <ol class="text">See PG. 31 for Birth CertificateSee PG. 40 for Social Security Card/ SSNSee PG. 46 for Driver License and State ID</ol>
                <h5 class="question">When could I start, and can I start if I am currently incarcerated? </h5>
                <p class="answer">It’s never too early to start trying to get a form of official ID. It helps to begin while you are still incarcerated as part of your preparation for release. If you are in a California state prison, a new state law requires the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to ensure that all eligible individuals have a California State ID upon release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This new law expands the “CAL-ID Program,” which is already available at California prison facilities called “reentry hubs,” to ALL California state prisons, requiring that the prison give you a California State ID <em>FOR FREE</em> at the time of release, if you are eligible. See PG. 47 for more information on this new program and what makes you eligible.If you’re already out, you have probably realized very quickly how important ID documents are in everyday life and it’s best to begin the process right away. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152654"></a>I have used different names (“aliases”). What name is best to use on my ID documents?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your ID documents must be in your “legal” name. This will be <em>the name that appears on your birth certificate</em>, unless you have <em>legally</em> changed it. Changes in your legal name are done through marriage or by court order.<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Using a false name or presenting false documents to get ID is a FEDERAL offense. Don’t do it. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152655"></a>Can I legally change my name?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. The California Courts website gives step-by-step instructions for changing your name online at the following website: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-namechange.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-namechange.htm</a>, which has specific information for people who are divorcing, getting married, changing their legal gender, and other requests.<strong> </strong>A judge must approve legal name changes. In all cases, you will need to prove that your name change doesn’t pose any security risk to the community.<sup><a href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4">[4]</a></sup> A judge may find that you <em>cannot</em> legally change your name if:</p>
                <ol class="text">The judge finds that you are changing your name to commit fraud; ORThe judge finds that you are changing your name to hide from the police or law enforcement or for some other illegal reason; ORYou are currently on probation or parole—UNLESS your probation or parole officer is aware of your legal name change AND gives you written approval; ORIf you are incarcerated in prison.If you are incarcerated in a California state prison, the <em>Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)</em> MUST give the judge permission to let you change your name.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152656"></a>I am an undocumented person. Can I get an official form of ID if I am undocumented?</h3>
                <p class="text">No, but you may be able to get a special type of Driver License (called an “AB 60” License) approved for undocumented people to drive legally in California, and California only.An AB 60 “Undocumented Person” Driver License will NOT serve as official identification (meaning it does not establish eligibility for employment, voter registration, or public benefits), but it WILL ALLOW YOU to drive a car legally in the state of California.<sup><a href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6">[6]</a></sup> It’s against state law for state police to discriminate against anyone driving with an AB 60 License in California, but <em>federal agents and law enforcement agencies outside of California</em> are NOT required to honor your AB 60 Driver License. Depending on local laws and policies, you could face criminal or immigration consequences if you show your AB 60 “Undocumented” CA Driver License to a police officer in another state—so use it <em>only in California</em>! And do NOT try to use it in federal facilities, such as passing airport screenings or crossing through Customs and Border Patrols!<sup><a href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Airports and Customs are federal, and they do NOT honor AB 60 license, and could use this against you.For more information on what it means to be an undocumented person in the U.S., you can contact a referral and information hotline such as 1-888-6-CHIRLA (1-888-624-4752), provided in English and Spanish by the <em>Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles</em>. The hotline is open Monday—Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and can provide direct services or refer you to other organizations that can help you.

                <h4 class="textbox">General Tips for Getting ID</h4>
                <ul class="textbox"><strong>Start as early as you can.</strong> You can start gathering some documents while you’re incarcerated. <strong>Start by getting your birth certificate </strong>(or naturalization certificate if you were born outside the U.S. and later became a citizen). A certified copy of your birth certificate or naturalization certificate is necessary to get all other forms of ID. See PG. 31 (birth certificate) or PG. 39 (naturalization certificate).<strong>Stick to using your legal name as it appears on your birth certificate.</strong> Even if you have used other names in the past, stick with your legal name. It is your only legal identity.<strong>Keep photocopies of all your important forms as you go.Before you pay a fee for anything, find out if you can get a “reduced fee” or a “fee waiver” based on your income.</strong> Many forms of ID require that you pay a fee before they are issued. Some fees must be paid by everyone, while other fees can be reduced or excused (“waived”) for people with limited income. We have included some information about reduced fees on PG. 51, but always check for yourself.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> </ul>

                <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint<a id="ID_Notarized"></a>What does it mean to get a document “notarized”?</h4>
                <h4>WHAT IS NOTARIZATION?</h4>
                <p class="textbox"><em>Notarization</em> is when a government-approved person (called a “notary public” or just a “notary”) validates an important document. The notary must witness signatures to that document.</p>
                <h4>WHAT DO I BRING?</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">The document you need notarized. IMPORTANT: Don’t sign it before you go—the notary needs to witness your signature.Proof of who you are (usually Photo ID). IMPORTANT: The notary can verify who you are by one of 3 ways:Photo ID issued within the last 5 years. This can be: a state ID or a Driver License from any U.S. state, a passport from any country, a U.S. Military ID, a Canadian or Mexican driver’s license, or a California government employee ID card. <em>IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED: You can use your Prison ID card while you are still incarcerated, but not after you get out. This is why it is so important to get your birth certificate before you are released, if possible.</em>One witness whom the <em>notary knows </em>and who <em>knows you</em>. This witness will need to show one of the forms of acceptable IDs listed above, and verify under oath who you are. —OR—Two witnesses who <em>know you</em> (but the notary does <em>not</em> need to know them). Both of these witnesses will also be required to show one of the forms of acceptable IDs listed above, and verify under oath who you are.</ul>
                <h4>WHERE DO I FIND A NOTARY?</h4>
                <p class="textbox">Try your bank, credit union, public library, City Hall, local courthouse, Post Office, FedEx or UPS store, or a senior centers or local school. <em>Always call the location and check its website to make sure a notary exists, what times it is available, and the cost.</em> <em>IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED: </em>State prisons must provide notary services.<sup><a href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14">[14]</a></sup> Contact your corrections counselor to make an appointment, as it may only be available on certain days and times.</p>
                <h4>HOW MUCH WILL IS COST?</h4>
                <p class="textbox">A small fee or free. The most a notary can charge in CA is $10.00 per signature. However, mobile notary services that come to you are allowed to charge more.<sup><a href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15">[15]</a></sup><em>IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED: </em>There is an administrative fee, which varies by facility, and is taken out of your inmate trust account. If you would rather use a mobile notary, you’ll need to find one in your area that does jail/prison visits. You may need to ask a family member or friend to help arrange the visit.</p>

                <p class="text">It is best to get an <em>authorized</em> <em>certified</em> copy of your birth certificate.<strong>CERTIFIED COPY—</strong>A “certified” copy of your birth certificate is any official copy of your birth certificate issued by the Office of the County Recorder in the county where you were born, or from your state’s Office of Vital Records.<sup><a href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16">[16]</a></sup> These offices issue two types of certified copies—“authorized” and “informational.”</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong><em>Authorized</em> Certified Copy—</strong>An “authorized” certified birth certificate bears the stamp or seal of the office that issued it.<sup><a href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17">[17]</a></sup> It is called <em>authorized</em> because only certain individuals, such as you and your immediate family members, are allowed to get it.<sup><a href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18">[18]</a></sup> Access to authorized birth certificates is restricted because they are considered a valid form of government-issued ID, and can be used to get other forms of ID. This is the type of copy you need to get to prove your identification.</ol>
                <p class="text">VS.</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong><em>Informational</em> Certified Copy—</strong>An “informational” certified birth certificate contains the same information as an authorized copy, but it is not considered an official record of your identity. It does not bear the stamp or seal of the office that issued it, and it must contain the disclaimer statement: “INFORMATIONAL, NOT A VALID DOCUMENT TO ESTABLISH IDENTITY.”<sup><a href="#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19">[19]</a></sup> Anyone can order an informational copy of your birth certificate. This is not the type of copy you want to get to prove your identification.</ol>

                <p class="text">Only an <em>authorized certified</em> copy of your birth certificate can be used as proof of your identity.

                <p class="text">If you know what county you were born in, we recommend going directly through your County Recorder’s Office. Because the CDPH handles requests for the entire state, it often takes longer than if you go directly to the County Recorder’s Office, where it will be a much faster process (sometimes even the same day).<sup><a href="#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25">[25]</a></sup> The County Recorder’s Office is also more convenient because you can make your request <em>in person</em> as well as by mail.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152667"></a>How do I locate the county recorder’s office?</h3>
                <p class="text">Whether you plan to make your request in person or by mail, you will first need to locate the Recorder’s Office in the county in which you were born. The CDPH provides a statewide directory of County Recorder’s Offices (address, phone number, website). To get the address and phone number for the County Recorder’s Office, call CDPH Customer Service at (916) 445-2684 or visit the website at: <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/">http://www.cdph.ca.gov/</a> and search for “birth certificates.”<sup><a href="#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26">[26]</a></sup> You can also use Directory Assistance to locate the address by dialing 411 from any phone, but this service charges a fee (as much as $1.99 per 411 call).<sup><a href="#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27">[27]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152668"></a>If I use the county recorder’s office, is it best to request my birth certificate by mail or in person?</h3>
                <p class="text">Once you have located the Recorder’s Office in the county where you were born, you will need to decide if you want to request your birth certificate in person or by mail. In most counties, if you request the document in person at the Recorder’s Office, this is the best option because the clerk can tell you almost immediately whether or not there is a record of your birth on file, and you can ask the clerk questions if there is trouble locating the correct record. Also, you might even be able to get the <em>certified copy</em> that same day. However, this may not be the right option for you if you are unable to travel to your birth county because of parole or other travel restrictions.</p>
                <p><strong>REQUESTS TO RECORDER’S OFFICE BY MAIL: </strong></p>
                <p class="text">After you have located the Recorder’s Office in the county where you were born, you will need to get a copy of that county’s specific application form. You can request the form by phone or by mail, or you can download it from the County Recorder Office’s website. Once you have the form, the process for requesting your birth certificate by mail is the same as the process for requesting it by mail from the CDPH (see those instructions on PG. 34). Remember to:</p>
                <ol class="text">Complete the form to the best of your ability;Sign and have your Sworn Statement <em>notarized</em> (notarization explained in the box on PG. 32);Prepare the fee payment (varies by county);Mail your request packet (including your application form, Sworn Statement, and fee payment) to the County Recorder’s Office. </ol>
                <p><strong>REQUESTS TO RECORDER’S OFFICE IN PERSON:</strong></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152683"></a>What is a social security number (SSN) and what is a social security card? What is the difference and do I need both?</h3>
                <p class="text">If you were born in the U.S., and your birth was reported, the government assigned you a <strong><em>Social Security Number (SSN)</em></strong><em>.</em> Your SSN is a 9-digit number that is unique to you. The government uses it primarily to identify you, but also to track your income for tax purposes and to calculate any Social Security benefits you accrue as you work. Also, other institutions—like banks, hospitals, schools, and businesses—will use your SSN as a way to identify you.<sup><a href="#footnote-39" id="footnote-ref-39">[39]</a></sup> A <strong><em>Social Security Card</em></strong> is a paper card that provides a record of your name and SSN. Social Security Cards are issued only by the Social Security Administration of the federal government. Social Security Cards are always free.<sup><a href="#footnote-40" id="footnote-ref-40">[40]</a></sup>While there are many circumstances in which you will need to provide your <strong>SSN</strong>, you will only need to show the actual Social Security Card in a few limited situations—most commonly, when filling out employment paperwork. <em>For this reason, it is a good idea to memorize your SSN, but store your Social Security Card in a safe place and only carry it with you when you know you’ll need it.</em></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152684"></a>Why do I need to know my SSN?</h3>
                <p class="text">Like your birth certificate, your SSN proves who you are. You’ll need to provide your 9-digit SSN to access government services and to apply for jobs, public benefits, housing, a Driver License, healthcare, education programs, and financial aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-41" id="footnote-ref-41">[41]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152685"></a>I have a SSN, but I forgot it/never knew it. How do I find out what it is?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-42" id="footnote-ref-42">[42]</a></sup></strong> </h3>
                <p class="text">If you were assigned a SSN at some point in your life, but you don’t know it, you need to request a <em>replacement card</em>. This is the only way to get your number because the Social Security Administration (SSA) does not give out Social Security Numbers any other way. You can apply for a replacement card by mail or in person at a local SSA Field Office. For more information on getting a replacement card, see PG. 41 if you’re incarcerated, or PG. 43 if you’re out.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152686"></a>I don't think I ever got a SSN. Can I get one now?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. If you were never assigned a SSN, you will need to apply for an <em>original card</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-43" id="footnote-ref-43">[43]</a></sup> See PG. 45 for more information on getting an original card. </p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448152687"></a>Pre-release Planning—Getting a Social Security Card While Incarcerated:</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152688"></a>Can I get a social security card while I am still incarcerated?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. If you never had a SSN, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will not assign you one (“an original”) and issue your card while you are incarcerated. You will have to wait until you get out.However, if you were given a SSN at some point in the past, the SSA may issue you a replacement card with your original number on it while you are still incarcerated—under limited circumstances.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-44" id="footnote-ref-44">[44]</a></sup></sup> See the next question (PG. 41) for the procedures of getting a replacement card while incarcerated.</p>
                <h3><a id="Replacement_SSC_While_Incarcerated"></a><a id="_Toc448152689"></a>How do I get a replacement card while I am incarcerated?</h3>
                <p class="text">The process for requesting a replacement card while you are still incarcerated is fairly straightforward. However, due to conflicting rules and practices within the Social Security Administration (SSA), it’s hard to say whether you will be successful or not. You should try anyway. <em>Here is what may affect your request:</em></p>
                <ol class="text"><strong><em>The facility you are in: </em>Where you are incarcerated may affect your ability to get an SSC while you are still incarcerated.</strong><a id="MOUs_SSA"></a><strong><em>MOUs:</em></strong> Official policy states that before the SSA will accept “certification” (proof) of your identity from a correctional facility in order to get your SSN, that correctional facility must enter into a special formal agreement with the SSA called a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The purpose of the MOU is to ensure that the corrections officials follow the same strict procedures and requirements as the SSA officials do when they verify people’s identities. If your facility has an MOU with the SSA, the SSA will accept the facility’s certification that you are who you say you are as proof of your identity. However, not all state corrections agencies or facilities have MOU agreements with the SSA. If your facility does not have a current, valid, signed MOU with the SSA, the SSA field office reviewer that evaluates your application cannot accept a certification from the facility as a 100% proof of your identity. If your facility does not have an MOU with the SSA, then its certification carries less weight, and your application for a replacement Social Security Card is more likely to get denied.<strong><em>Your local Field Office/Reviewer:</em> The practices of your local Field Office in reviewing applications from incarcerated people will affect your ability to get a Social Security Card while you are incarcerated.</strong>If your facility does <em>not</em> have an MOU with the SSA, the local Field Office should still evaluate your application as it would any other application.<sup><a href="#footnote-45" id="footnote-ref-45">[45]</a></sup> This means that your reviewer can <em>consider</em> the certification, but can’t <em>rely</em> on it 100%. How much weight your reviewer gives to the certification will depend on that field office’s practices. Some field offices accept certifications without hassle; others do not. It’s always worth a try!</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152690"></a>How do I find out if my correctional facility has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement with the Social Security Administration (ssa)?</h3>
                <p class="text">Unfortunately, this information is not readily available. It may be best to just apply for a replacement card and see if it works!</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152691"></a>How do I apply for my replacement card from inside?</h3>
                <p class="text">The process for requesting a replacement card while you are incarcerated is the same whether your facility has an MOU with the SSA or not. Follow these steps:</p>
                <h4 class="step">Get and fill out the application for a Social Security Card (Form SS-5).</h4>
                <p class="text">The recommended way to get this form is by calling the Social Security Administration (SSA) at 1-800-772-1213 and asking to have it mailed to you. You may also be able to get the form by writing to your local Field Office or the closest Social Security Administration Regional Office. The Regional Office that serves California is:SSA Regional Public Affairs OfficeP.O. Box 4201Richmond, CA 94804Keep in mind that this office also serves Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, so your request may take some time. The form might also be available from your Correctional Counselor or other prison services staff. (We have included a sample Form SS-5 in Appendix D, PG. 103 for reference).</p>
                <h4 class="step">Gather the documents you will need.</h4>
                <p class="text">You will need to submit two documents with your application:</p>
                <ol class="text">Certification of Inmate Identity—If your facility has an MOU agreement with the SSA, there will be a designated prison official who will verify your identity through prison records and issue a “certification” to the SSA (explanation of MOUs on PG. 41 above).<sup><a href="#footnote-46" id="footnote-ref-46">[46]</a></sup> If your facility does not have an MOU agreement with the SSA, you should still ask for a certification. Talk to your correctional counselor; he or she should know who is the best person at the prison to give you a certification. Information Release—You will need to sign a release of information giving the SSA permission to send your Social Security Card/Number to your facility. Ask your correctional counselor for this form.</ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
                <p class="text"><strong><em>Whether or not your institution has an MOU agreement with the SSA, you should include the prison staff’s “certification” of your identity, as well as a copy of your Prison ID card, if possible.</em></strong> In fact, you should include any &amp; all documents related to your identification, because the SSA must consider everything. Start gathering documents while you’re incarcerated. If you don’t have primary forms of ID, you can use these types of proof after you get released, as well. Along with your birth certificate, these documents will probably be enough. See more info on “other proof of identity” on PG. 44.</p>

                <p class="text">You can apply to your local SSA office in person or make the request by mail. We strongly recommend applying IN PERSON for 3 reasons:</p>

                <p class="sidebox">You can only get an original SSN &amp; Card after you’re released. Go to PG. 45 to learn how.</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>REASON 1:</strong> First, if you go in person, the SSA agent gets to actually see that you are a real person, and this helps verify your identify, especially if you are someone coming out of prison or jail without any other official ID documents.<strong>REASON 2:</strong> Second, it will be less of a hassle for you to go in person. If you request a replacement card by mail, you are required to submit your <em>original</em> ID documents with your application. <em>This means that while your application is being processed, you won’t have these ID documents for other purposes.</em> Applications can take days or weeks to process. Just in case you still decide to request the replacement card by mail, we explain both processes—in person (PG. 43) and by mail (PG. 44).<strong>REASON 3:</strong> Lastly, the in-person process is much faster than the by-mail process. If the SSA accepts your application, you will be able to leave with your new Social Security Number the same day (and they will mail you the card)!</ol>

                <p class="text">Remember, the SSA agent is going to evaluate the evidence you bring in and make a judgment call as to who you are. While none of the documents you may have might be enough alone to prove your identity, if you are there in person with as much identifying documentation as possible, everything combined will hopefully be enough to prove your identity.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: HERE IS HOW TO GET A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD WHEN YOU DON’T HAVE THE PRIMARY ID YOU NEED: If you have been incarcerated for a long time, or were incarcerated when you were young, chances are you never had one of these primary ID documents, or the government took it and destroyed it long ago. Unfortunately, the SSA writes these rules for the general public—for people who still have valid and current primary ID documents and can easily replace their Social Security Card. Even if you do not have primary ID documents, you may still be able to get a replacement Social Security Card. Gather as much identifying information and documentation as you can to include with your application. Then, on a case-by-case basis, the SSA gets to decide whether or not you have sufficiently proven who you are.<em>IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY ID DOCUMENT, USE AS MANY OF THE FOLLOWING AS YOU HAVE:</em></p>
                <ul class="importantbox">Authorized Birth Certificate—Without a primary ID document, your birth certificate will be the most important document you submit. But the birth certificate alone is not enough to show proof of your identity. This is because the SSA still needs proof that the person named on the birth certificate is alive and that you are that person!<a id="MOUs_SSA_otherproofofidentity"></a>Other proof of identity—The more evidence of your identity that you can provide, the better. Any ID with your picture and name on it, even if it is not government-issued, will make it easier to prove who you are to the SSA. Other proof you can consider are: an employee ID; a school ID; a library card; a Prison ID card, a U.S. Military ID; a health insurance or Medicaid/Medi-Cal card (not Medicare); or a certified copy of your medical record from a health clinic, doctor, or hospital that treated you.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-51" id="footnote-ref-51">[51]</a></sup></sup></strong> The SSA employees are instructed to consider each applicant’s situation on a case-by-case basis, and all of the evidence presented. </ul>

In California, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues both of these documents. The major difference between the two forms of ID is that a California State ID Card can <em>only</em> be used for<em> identification </em>purposes, but does not permit you to drive a car. A California Driver License can be used for <em>identification</em> AND permits you to <em>drive</em> a car.<sup><a href="#footnote-59" id="footnote-ref-59">[59]</a></sup>Once you have an authorized copy of your birth certificate (PG. 31) and know your Social Security Number (SSN) (PG. 40), you have what you need to apply for a California state ID card and/or a California Driver’s License. </p>

                <p class="text">Both a California State ID and a California Driver License serve as an official government-issued, photo identification that can be used to prove your identity, age, and legal presence* in the United States. Either one will allow you to prove your identity, for example, when you open a bank account, register to vote, or apply for jobs, housing, or public benefits. If you eventually want to <em>drive</em>, you will need to get a Driver License, but because that process requires testing, we recommend that you get a California State ID first, so that you can get an official ID faster. Once you get a CA State ID, you can <em>always</em> go back and take a driving test to get your Driver License. But this allows you to have official ID easily and quickly. </p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152702"></a>I am currently incarcerated. Can I apply for a CA state ID or a CA Driver license?</h3>
                <p class="text">You cannot apply for a Driver License from prison or jail. This must be done in person.But you <em>might </em>be able to apply for a California State ID if your prison has a <em>California Identification Card program (“CAL-ID program”)</em> and you have a release date. Find more information on the CAL-ID program on PG. 47.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152703"></a><a id="Cal_ID_Program_for_Prisoners"></a>What is the CAL-ID program?</h3>
                <p class="text">The CAL-ID program provides certain state prisoners with a valid CA State Identification Card—FOR FREE<em>—at the time they are released from prison</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-61" id="footnote-ref-61">[61]</a></sup> This means <em>all eligible</em> <em>prisoners</em> in a California state prison preparing for release have the right to receive a California State ID when they leave prison. <strong><em>In the past</em></strong>, the CAL-ID program was available only at CDCR prisons designated as “Reentry Hubs.” But starting January 1, 2015, a new state law required that the CAL-ID program expand to ALL adult state prisons in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-62" id="footnote-ref-62">[62]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152704"></a>In what facilities is the CAL-ID program available?</h3>
                <p class="text">As of July 2015, the CAL-ID program has now been expanded to all 36 state prison facilities in California. HOWEVER, the CAL-ID Program is NOT available at CDCR’s contracted facilities (called “Community Correctional Facilities”) or CDCR’s conservation camps (also known as “fire camps”). This is because CDCR and the DMV do <em>not</em> consider contracted facilities or fire camps to be “state prisons” under the law.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-63" id="footnote-ref-63">[63]</a></sup></sup> This interpretation has not been challenged.Thus, the CAL-ID program is not available at any fire camps OR contracted facilities, which include the following:</p>
                <ol class="text">Golden State Modified Community Correctional Facility (GSMCCF), Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility (DVMCCF), Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility (CVMCCF), Shafter Modified Community Correctional Facility (SMCCF), Taft Modified Community Correctional Facility (TMCCF), Delano Modified Community Correctional Facility (DMCCF), Female Community Reentry Facility (FCRF). </ol>
                <p class="text">If your facility is a contracted “community correctional facility” listed above or a fire camp (“conservation camp”), then unfortunately you cannot apply for a California State ID card while you are still incarcerated through the CAL-ID program. You will have to wait to apply for a CA State ID card after release.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152705"></a>Who is eligible for the CAL-ID program?</h3>
                <p class="text">Under the expanded CAL-ID program, you are eligible for a CA State ID if:</p>
                <ol class="text">You have a set release date AND you are 120 - 210 days (approximately 4-7 months) away from that release date;You previously had a CA State ID <em>or</em> CA Driver License;Your previous CA State ID or Driver License was <em>issued in the past 10 years</em>; You <em>don’t owe any DMV fees</em> for your previous CA State ID or Driver License;You have a <em>photo</em> on file with the DMV that is <em>no more than 10 years old</em>; You <em>don’t</em> have any <em>active felony holds, warrants, or detainers</em> that could cause you to go back to prison or jail after your release;You <em>don’t</em> have an <em>active Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold</em> that would cause you to be deported after your release;You can provide an <em>address</em> where you will live after your release (Note: this is the address that will be printed on the CA State ID card, not your prison address); ANDYou provide the following information, and the DMV can make sure it’s true:True full name;Date of birth; Valid Social Security Number (SSN); Legal presence (legal immigration status) in the U.S. <em>Note: CDCR should have your information on file, in case you don’t know some of these details.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-64" id="footnote-ref-64">[64]</a></sup></ol>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152706"></a>I think I am eligible under the CAL-ID program. How do I apply?</h3>
                <p class="text">If you want to apply for a CA State ID card through the CAL-ID program, talk to your correctional counselor (also called a “CC I”) at the prison.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-65" id="footnote-ref-65">[65]</a></sup>CDCR has informed us that the screening process takes place during the Release Program Study (RPS) (read more about the RPS on PG. 147), which is usually performed 120-240 days prior to the prisoner’s release. CDCR has also informed us that a Parole Services Associate (PSA) collects the CAL-ID applications, sends them to CDCR headquarters, and monitors each prisoner’s progress in the CAL-ID program using an electronic tracking log.As your release date approaches, you should be meeting with your counselor to develop a reentry plan. If you’re eligible for the CAL-ID program, your counselor should help you fill out the application for a CA State ID. If your counselor has not mentioned the program, and you think you are eligible, you should bring it to your counselor’s attention. The prison staff will check that all of your information is accurate, and then send your application to the CAL-ID Coordinator’s office at CDCR, which then shares it with the DMV.If the DMV finds that you are eligible, it will send your new CA State ID directly to the prison. The prison will hold the ID in your file and give it to you at the time you are released. NOTE: It’s possible your CA State ID card won’t arrive in time before your release—for example, if your release date is recalculated so that you get out earlier than expected. In this case, once your CA State ID card is ready, the prison will send it to your address in the community, or (if you’re on parole) send it to your parole officer to give it to you.</p>

                <p class="text">If your Driver License was <em>suspended</em> or <em>revoked</em>, this means you lost your right to drive as a penalty for a violation, a criminal conviction, and/or an unpaid debt. Here are examples of each of these: </p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Driving Violations:</strong> Driving under the influence, hit-and-run, fleeing a law enforcement officer, driving without proof of car insurance, too many accidents in a short time, too many “negative points” on your driver record, or driving recklessly (road rage, speeding, racing, etc.).<sup><a href="#footnote-149" id="footnote-ref-149">[149]</a></sup><strong>Other Violations:</strong> Truancy, vandalism (including graffiti), fleeing a police officer, failing to appear in court, or failing to report an accident.<strong>Unpaid Debts:</strong> Failing to pay traffic ticket fines;<sup><a href="#footnote-150" id="footnote-ref-150">[150]</a></sup> failing to pay other court-ordered fines, fees and restitution; failing to pay child support; or failing to pay other debts (such as loans, credit card payments, medical bills, car payments, payday loans, landlord dues, utility bills, etc.) if the person to whom you owe money gets a judgment against you in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-151" id="footnote-ref-151">[151]</a></sup> <em>NOW THERE’S HELP! </em> Read more about how California’s new <strong>Traffic Amnesty Program</strong> may help you get your CA Driver License back if it was suspended because you failed to appear in court, or because you failed to pay a traffic court fine on PG. 750 in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER (chapter begins on PG. 717, and includes other helpful information about traffic fines and court-ordered debt).CHILD SUPPORT DEBT  Read more about a suspended Driver License due to unpaid child support in the text box on PG. 59.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152713"></a>What does it mean if my license was suspended? </h3>
                <p class="text">If your Driver License was suspended, that means you <em>temporarily</em> lost your driving privileges, but not forever. If your license was suspended, you will not be able to drive for a period of time, anywhere from 30 days to a few years.<sup><a href="#footnote-153" id="footnote-ref-153">[153]</a></sup> After your period of suspension has passed, your license is automatically reinstated.However, if your license was suspended because of a physical or mental condition or disorder that affects your ability to drive, that suspension will be permanent if that condition becomes permanent.<sup><a href="#footnote-154" id="footnote-ref-154">[154]</a></sup> A <em>restricted license</em> allows you to drive during a period of suspension, but only for specific purposes that a judge has granted you permission to do, such as to drive to work, school, or a court-ordered program (for example, a DUI class).<sup><a href="#footnote-155" id="footnote-ref-155">[155]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152714"></a>What does it mean if my license was revoked? </h3>
                <p class="text">If your Driver License was revoked, that means your driving privileges are “terminated” (ended). You may be able to get a Driver License again, but you likely will have to wait several years. In extreme cases,<sup><a href="#footnote-156" id="footnote-ref-156">[156]</a></sup> you may be legally forbidden from ever driving again.<sup><a href="#footnote-157" id="footnote-ref-157">[157]</a></sup> If you become eligible for a Driver License again after it was revoked, you will have to apply for a new license.</p>

                <p class="text">Maybe. Unless your license was <em>permanently </em>revoked, you should be able to regain your driving privileges if (1) the required time period of your suspension or revocation has passed, AND (2) you’ve fulfilled any conditions of your suspension or revocation.<sup><a href="#footnote-158" id="footnote-ref-158">[158]</a></sup> Depending on the reason why your license was suspended, the length of suspension will vary, and the steps you will need to take to get your license back will also vary.<sup><a href="#footnote-159" id="footnote-ref-159">[159]</a></sup> If your Driver License was suspended or revoked and you want to regain your driving privileges, here are some steps you can take:<sup><a href="#footnote-160" id="footnote-ref-160">[160]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="step">Know the details of your situation.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-161" id="footnote-ref-161">[161]</a></sup></strong> </h4>
                <p class="text">The requirements to reinstate your license will depend on exactly why it was suspended or revoked. Call the DMV at 1-800-777-0133, ask them to look up your case, and find out what you need to do. When you call, be prepared with your old Driver License number and any information the DMV has sent to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-162" id="footnote-ref-162">[162]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">Unless your Driver License was permanently revoked, you’ll probably find out that you need to fulfill specific conditions (see <strong>STEP 2 </strong>below) and submit “proof of completion” of those conditions to the DMV to reinstate your license.<sup><a href="#footnote-163" id="footnote-ref-163">[163]</a></sup>If you have a Failure to Appear (FTA), Failure to Pay (FTP), or other failure to comply on your DMV record (which may be the reason your Driver License was suspended and/or make it difficult to renew your license), and the charge is <em>more than 5 years old</em>, you may be able to get the charge erased from your DMV record and reinstate your license by calling the DMV Mandatory Actions Line (Telephone: 916-657-6525).<sup><a href="#footnote-164" id="footnote-ref-164">[164]</a></sup> You may also qualify for California’s new <em>Traffic Amnesty Program</em>, which could help you reduce the debt on old California traffic court debt and certain types of traffic tickets and also may help you get a suspended CA Driver License back. Read more about the program on PG. 750 in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER.</ol>
                <h4 class="step">Make sure that you fulfill the conditions of your suspension or revocation. </h4>
                <ol class="text">You may be required to complete traffic school, DUI treatment, or jail time, and to provide documents proving that you did so. You may also be required to pay fees and fines, including court-related fees and additional penalties imposed by the DMV. See the chart on PG. 58 for examples of requirements and steps to get your license back.Keep all documents proving that you’ve fulfilled these conditions, such as certificates and pay stubs, and be prepared to submit them as required. You will also need to submit proof of “financial responsibility.” Most of the time, this means proof of car insurance.<sup><a href="#footnote-165" id="footnote-ref-165">[165]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Prepare all required documents and payments.</h4>
                <p class="text">Make copies of all your important documents, and keep careful records of all payments.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Submit all required documents and payments to the DMV. </h4>
                <p class="text">Confirm that you’re eligible to reinstate your license, and get proof from the DMV. Once you’ve completed these 4 steps, you may be able to reinstate your Driver License (if it was <em>suspended</em>) or apply for a renewal Driver License (if it was <em>revoked</em>). In some cases, after you’ve completed some or most of the requirements, you may be able to get a <em>restricted license</em> if your suspension or revocation period hasn’t ended yet.<sup><a href="#footnote-166" id="footnote-ref-166">[166]</a></sup><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your license was suspended due to court-ordered debt, and these debts have been referred to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) for collection, there is a special payment process to speed up the return of your Driver License. For instructions, go online to <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/payment.shtml">https://www.ftb.ca.gov/online/Court_Ordered_Debt/payment.shtml</a>, and see Appendix F, PG. 108 of this chapter.</p>

                <p class="textbox">If your Driver License was suspended due to unpaid child support and you cannot pay the amount required, you can ask a judge to reinstate your license temporarily. To do so, you can file a Notice of Motion for Judicial Review of License Denial (Form FL-670) with the court that issued your child support order.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-167" id="footnote-ref-167">[167]</a></sup></sup> This form asks the judge of that court to consider giving you back your Driver License so that you can continue to go to work and earn money to pay the child support. The judge will make the final decision, not the local child support agency (LCSA).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-168" id="footnote-ref-168">[168]</a></sup></sup> For more information about child support, see PG. 860 of the FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN CHAPTER.</p>

                <p class="text">Unfortunately, if your Driver License was suspended or revoked in another state, you cannot get a California Driver License until: </p>
                <ol class="text">You fix the violation and complete all the requirements to get your license reinstated in the state where the suspension or revocation happened; and/orThe period of suspension or revocation is over, or more than 1 year has passed since the revocation.<sup><a href="#footnote-170" id="footnote-ref-170">[170]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">To figure out your situation and what steps you need to take, it’s best to contact the DMV agency in the state where your license was suspended or revoked. If you do not know in which state the suspension/revocation happened, you can call the National Driver Register to find out where the problem occurred (see more information immediately below).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152717"></a>What laws could negatively affect me if I am trying to get (or keep) a California driver license?</h3>
                <p class="text">A few different laws, explained below, may affect your ability to get or keep a CA Driver License:</p>
                <h4>National Driver Register (NDR)<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-171" id="footnote-ref-171">[171]</a></sup></em></strong></h4>
                <p class="text">When you apply for a California Driver License, the California DMV will check to see whether your name is listed in the NDR’s Problem Driver Pointer System.<sup><a href="#footnote-172" id="footnote-ref-172">[172]</a></sup> The NDR database contains information about all drivers who have had their licenses denied, revoked or suspended, or who have been convicted of serious traffic violations such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.<sup><a href="#footnote-173" id="footnote-ref-173">[173]</a></sup> The NDR has information on drivers from <em>all 50 states</em>.If your name appears in the NDR database, the DMV will investigate the reason and decide whether or not to issue you a CA Driver License. If your license was suspended or revoked in another state, the DMV will not issue you a CA Driver License until you fulfill the conditions of suspension or revocation in the other state (including paying all fines and reinstatement fees).<sup><a href="#footnote-174" id="footnote-ref-174">[174]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question">How do I find out if my name is in the NDR database?</h5>
                <p class="answer">You can find out if your name is in the NDR database and check your driver status <em>for free</em> by sending a request letter to the NDR.<sup><a href="#footnote-175" id="footnote-ref-175">[175]</a></sup> Although the database does not contain your detailed driving record (i.e., it will not tell you <em>why</em> your license was suspended), it will tell you the status of your driver license and the state where any problem occurred (called the State-of-Record, or SOR).<sup><a href="#footnote-176" id="footnote-ref-176">[176]</a></sup> If you already know the state in which your offense occurred, it may be faster and easier to contact that state’s DMV agency directly for information.To check your NDR status, write and send a notarized letter (also called a “privacy act request”) to the NDR, stating that you would like an NDR file check. Make sure to include your full legal name, date of birth, gender, height, weight, eye color, and your previous driver license number and state (if you know them); your social security number is optional.<sup><a href="#footnote-177" id="footnote-ref-177">[177]</a></sup> If your name is in the NDR database, it may mean that your driver license has been suspended, cancelled, revoked, or denied because of a serious traffic violation.<sup><a href="#footnote-178" id="footnote-ref-178">[178]</a></sup></p>
                <h5 class="question">What can I do if my name is in the NDR database?</h5>
                <p class="answer">Once you know your driver license status and which state the problem occurred in, you must contact that state’s DMV agency directly to find out how to resolve the issue and reinstate your license.<sup><a href="#footnote-179" id="footnote-ref-179">[179]</a></sup> You may need to request a copy of your driving record from that state, in order to learn why your license was suspended or revoked.<sup><a href="#footnote-180" id="footnote-ref-180">[180]</a></sup>If you think the NDR database is incorrect, you will still need to contact the state DMV agency where the problem supposedly occurred. You will need to resolve the error directly with agency before the NDR can correct or delete your record.<sup><a href="#footnote-181" id="footnote-ref-181">[181]</a></sup></p>
                <h4>Driver License Compact (DLC)</h4>
                <p class="text">The DLC is an agreement between California and most other states in the U.S. to share driver records and information about traffic violations.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-182" id="footnote-ref-182">[182]</a></sup></sup> When you apply for a California Driver License, the California DMV will check to see if you ever had a Driver License in another state.<sup><a href="#footnote-183" id="footnote-ref-183">[183]</a></sup> If your license from another state was <em>suspended</em>, the DMV will not issue a new license until the suspension period is over.<sup><a href="#footnote-184" id="footnote-ref-184">[184]</a></sup> If your license from another state was <em>revoked</em>, the DMV will not issue a new license until the revocation period is over or 1 year has passed since the revocation (whichever comes first).<sup><a href="#footnote-185" id="footnote-ref-185">[185]</a></sup> In addition, the DLC requires each state to enforce traffic convictions that happened in another state—including by suspending or revoking your license for serious violations. For example, if you have a California Driver License, but you were convicted of a DUI in another state, the state where your DUI occurred will report the conviction to the California DMV. The California DMV will then penalize you for the violation—including suspending or revoking your California Driver License—just as if the violation had occurred locally.<sup><a href="#footnote-186" id="footnote-ref-186">[186]</a></sup> The conviction will also appear on your California driving record.<sup><a href="#footnote-187" id="footnote-ref-187">[187]</a></sup> If you want to appeal your license suspension for an out-of-state traffic conviction, you will have to follow California’s appeal procedures.<sup><a href="#footnote-188" id="footnote-ref-188">[188]</a></sup> In general, you will have to show that the other state’s DUI conviction is not the same as California’s DUI laws, or that the conviction was invalid for some other reason.<sup><a href="#footnote-189" id="footnote-ref-189">[189]</a></sup></p>
                <h4>Nonresident Violator Compact (NRVC)<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-190" id="footnote-ref-190">[190]</a></sup></em></strong> (not yet in CA)</h4>
                <p class="text">The NRVC is another agreement among most U.S. states to enforce out-of-state traffic violations. If you get an out-of-state ticket and then fail to pay the fine or appear in court, the state where you got the ticket will notify your home state (where your Driver License is from) that you didn’t comply with the ticket. Your home state can then suspend your license for failing to comply with the out-of-state ticket.Currently, California is <em>not</em> part of the NRVC, so failing to comply with an out-of-state ticket may not affect your California Driver License.<sup><a href="#footnote-191" id="footnote-ref-191">[191]</a></sup> (However, the California DMV can still penalize you for the traffic violation itself, just not for your failure to comply with it.) On the other hand, if your Driver License is from another state, but you receive a ticket in California, you may have to pay the traffic fine or post bail immediately (or be subject to arrest if you cannot pay right away), and/or you may lose the right to drive in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-192" id="footnote-ref-192">[192]</a></sup>If your right to drive in California has been suspended or revoked, but your Driver License is from another state, you can use Form DL 300, “California Proof Requirements for Non-Residents,” to prove your ability to pay and/or car insurance (called “financial responsibility”) and request that your California driving privileges be restored. The form is available online at <a href="http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/forms/dl/dl300.pdf">http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/forms/dl/dl300.pdf</a>.</p>
                <h4>Driver License Agreement<strong><em><sup><a href="#footnote-193" id="footnote-ref-193">[193]</a></sup></em></strong> (not yet in CA)</h4>
                <p class="text">The Driver License Agreement combines the DLC and NRVC into a single agreement, and increases enforcement of out-of-state traffic violations, making the rules stricter and more severe.<sup><a href="#footnote-194" id="footnote-ref-194">[194]</a></sup> However, this agreement is still very new and doesn’t apply in most states (including California).<sup><a href="#footnote-195" id="footnote-ref-195">[195]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="textbox">You may be able to get one of these limited forms of ID, which can be used for some but not all purposes:<strong>Consular Identification Cards (CIDs):</strong> Some governments issue CID cards to identify their citizens who are living in foreign countries. CID cards can be issued to people who are undocumented or documented in the foreign county. See Appendix H, PG. 115, for a list of countries that issue CIDs. If you are a citizen of one of these countries, visit the nearest consulate to obtain your CID card. In the U.S., CID cards can be a helpful ID document as you try to get a Driver License, open a bank account, show proof of identity to police, and access other services. However, CIDs do not grant you legal presence in the U.S. or other privileges.<sup><a href="#footnote-197" id="footnote-ref-197">[197]</a></sup> <strong>Municipal IDs:</strong> A handful of California cities have begun issuing municipal (“city”) ID cards for their residents. You can use these to get access to city services and benefits. More importantly, they are considered a form of identification by local officials and may provide evidence to get other forms of ID. Additionally, these forms of ID do not require proof of citizenship or legal presence of any kind.</p>
                <ul class="textbox"><strong><em>San Francisco City ID Card—</em></strong>Photo ID card for SF residents to get access to city programs and connect to local businesses.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152729"></a>How do I get a tribal ID card?</h3>
                <p class="text">The process may be slightly different for each tribe, and it depends on whether you are already enrolled with the tribe. PLEASE NOTE: Requests for Tribal ID Cards no longer go through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), whose California office is based in Sacramento, CA; these requests now go directly to the tribe to which you will be returning. <strong><em>If neither you or your parents enrolled with your tribe, the basic steps for getting a tribal ID card are as follows:</em></strong></p>
                <h4 class="step">First, you need the name of the tribe to which you are returning.The best next step is to call or write your tribe’s enrollment department, and ask if they have enrollment <em>forms</em> and <em>instructions</em>; if so, ask them to send these to you.Send the tribe to which you will be returning <em>as many details as possible</em> about your family history and tribal ancestry (and if applicable, use the forms they sent you).</h4>
                <p class="text">You will need to give the tribe as many details about your ancestry as possible—not just your parents’ information, but also information about your grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great grandparents, great-great-great grandparents, and so on. Include information about your family tree and history as far back as you can.<strong><em>If you or your parents ARE enrolled with your tribe, the basic steps for getting a tribal ID card are as follows:</em></strong></p>
                <h4 class="step">Contact the tribe’s enrollment department directly, and they will likely be able to assist you in a getting a copy of your Tribal ID Card.Follow any instructions given to you by the tribe.</h4>
                <p class="text"><em>Note:</em> The process for obtaining a tribal ID card is much easier if you or one of your parents is enrolled in the tribe.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152730"></a>If I am registered with a tribe, will they have other identification documents on file for me or my family members?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends on the tribe and whether you are enrolled. If you are already enrolled with a tribe and trying to recover old identification documents (ID), you can contact your tribe directly and ask if they have any of those documents on file. There is no guarantee, but it’s worth checking!</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152736"></a>Why register to vote?</h3>
                <p class="text">Voting is a way to<em> </em>participate<em> </em>in <em>choosing the laws and the decision-makers</em> in your community. Voting can also be a meaningful way to <em>exercise your rights</em> as a citizen, and an opportunity to <em>express your political identity</em> as a member of your city, county, state, and/or country.<em>As a person with a criminal record, you may or may not have lost your right to vote.</em> If you’re still able to vote, you may be deciding whether to exercise your right. If you’ve lost your right to vote and need to restore it, you may be deciding whether it’s worth the effort. Either way, voting rights are extremely important in each citizen having a voice—and yet states have absolute power to restrict <em>or</em> restore the voting rights of people with criminal records.<sup><a href="#footnote-240" id="footnote-ref-240">[240]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152737"></a>Who can register to vote in California?</h3>
                <p class="text">Generally speaking, to register to vote in the next election, you must be a U.S. citizen, a California resident, and at least age 18 by Election Day. <em>Bu</em>t even if you meet those requirements, you might not be able to register depending on your custody or supervision status. See the next question.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152738"></a>I have a criminal record. Can I register to vote in California?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends.<sup><a href="#footnote-241" id="footnote-ref-241">[241]</a></sup> A <strong>MISDEMEANOR conviction</strong> <em>never</em> affects your voting rights in California. If you have only misdemeanor(s) on your record, you still have your voting rights! A <strong>FELONY conviction</strong> <em>could</em> cause you to lose your voting rights in California—<strong>BUT ONLY</strong> while you are in prison for a felony; in jail waiting to be transferred to prison for a felony; in jail serving a “Realignment” felony sentence; <em>and/or</em> on state parole (not probation, PRCS, or Mandatory Supervision!).<sup><a href="#footnote-242" id="footnote-ref-242">[242]</a></sup> Your right to vote is automatically restored after one of those ends. <em>Note:</em> If you were found mentally ill, you only lose your right to vote during the time you were involuntarily committed.<sup><a href="#footnote-243" id="footnote-ref-243">[243]</a></sup> <em>See the chart on PG. 74 to better understand how your criminal record and supervision status will affect your voting rights.</em></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152740"></a>I don’t know my supervision status. How do I find out?</h3>
                <p class="text">It is very common to not know what kind of supervision you are on! If you are unaware or unsure of what your supervision status is, you should talk to your supervising officer or your public defender to find out what category you fall into. Tell them you are trying to determine if you are eligible to vote. You can even show them this chart to help figure out what classification you are in! <strong>It’s also possible that you are on multiple forms of supervision.</strong> If you are on more than one type of supervision and either one prevents you from voting, then you <em>cannot</em> vote. In other words, if you look at the chart—both of your supervision status categories must say “yes;” if one says “no,” you cannot vote.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152741"></a>What if I voted in an election that I was not legally allowed to vote in? </h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. If you ACCIDENTALLY voted in an election that you were not allowed to vote in, you will probably not be in trouble with the law. Voter fraud requires “specific intent.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-247" id="footnote-ref-247">[247]</a></sup></sup> This means that you had to have meant to vote in an election, knowing that you were not allowed to vote and with the purpose of voting even though you knew you were not supposed to vote.If you PURPOSEFULLY voted in an election, knowing you were not supposed to vote, you could be found guilty of voter fraud.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-248" id="footnote-ref-248">[248]</a></sup></sup> While majority of the voter fraud crimes are prosecuted when committed on the large scale to impact elections, the punishment can be up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-249" id="footnote-ref-249">[249]</a></sup></sup></p>

                <p class="sidebox">Although a prison ID isn’t explicitly listed as acceptable ID, the law does allow a “document issued by a government agency” to prove who you are. (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, § 20107(d)(2)(E).) Because your prison ID was issued by the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR), which is a government agency, it <em>should be </em>an acceptable form of ID. Keep in mind though that the people who work at the polling stations are volunteers and not experts in California law, so you may need to speak with a few different people if you are having difficulties. Remember: you won’t need your prison ID card at all if you were able to provide a SSN, Driver License number, or State ID number when you registered.</p>

                <ol class="text">If you register using the online form, the timestamp must be before midnight on the deadline date (by 11:59 p.m.).If you register using a paper form, it must be postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election.

Examples of documents you could show at the voting poll are: a military ID, a student ID, <em>a prison ID,</em> a utility bill, and/or a check from the government.<sup><a href="#footnote-251" id="footnote-ref-251">[251]</a></sup> You’ll only have to show these kinds of documents before voting if ALL of the following is true:</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448152750"></a>I registered to vote. Where, when, and how do I vote in the next election? </h3>
                <p class="text">In California, you can vote in two ways: (1) by mail ballot, or (2) at your local county polling place. <strong><em>Voting by Mail—</em></strong>If you’re already registered to vote at your current home address, contact your county elections office to request a vote-by-mail ballot application form (see PG. 76 to learn how to find the nearest county elections office).<sup><a href="#footnote-267" id="footnote-ref-267">[267]</a></sup> Once you get this form in the mail, complete and return it to the county elections office at least 7 days before the election. <strong><em>Voting in Person—</em></strong>Once you’re registered, you’ll get a sample ballot in the mail (which you don't need to fill out—its just supposed to help to prepare you for election day). Your voting location (called a “polling place”) is listed on this ballot. You can also call your county elections office<sup><a href="#footnote-268" id="footnote-ref-268">[268]</a></sup> to ask about your voting location. On the day of the election, go to this location to vote. All polls should be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152751"></a>When is election day? </h3>
                <p class="text">The General Election is on the first Tuesday of November.<sup><a href="#footnote-269" id="footnote-ref-269">[269]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152752"></a>Can I get time off from work to vote in California? </h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. If you don’t have enough time outside of work to vote, you have to right to take time off from work to vote—up to 2 hours, which must be paid time off. You need to tell your employer at least 2 working days in advance, and you can only take the time off at the start or end of your workday, unless you have made a different agreement with your boss.<sup><a href="#footnote-270" id="footnote-ref-270">[270]</a></sup> This applies to part-time and temporary employees as well IF you are hired to work for more than 52 hours over the course of 90 calendar days.<sup><a href="#footnote-271" id="footnote-ref-271">[271]</a></sup> But note that <em>independent contractors</em> are not considered employees under law, and thus don’t have the right to paid time off to vote.<sup><a href="#footnote-272" id="footnote-ref-272">[272]</a></sup> However, even when you don’t have the right to get paid time off to vote, you can take a reasonable time off work to vote, because federal law prohibits anyone from interfering with citizens’ right to vote.<sup><a href="#footnote-273" id="footnote-ref-273">[273]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152753"></a>I have a physical disability. Can I get help getting access to my voting location? </h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. Follow these two steps:<strong>STEP 1:</strong> First, contact your county elections office to find out if your voting location (“polling place”) is accessible to you, given your disability. <strong>STEP 2:</strong> Second, if your voting location isn’t accessible to you, “curbside voting” should be available. With “curbside voting,” you will be asked to get as close as possible to the voting area as you can, and elections officials should bring you a sign-in sheet, ballot, and any other voting materials you may need.<sup><a href="#footnote-274" id="footnote-ref-274">[274]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152754"></a>English isn’t my first language. Can I get a ballot in my native language?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. Call your county elections office to find out in what languages your county has the ballot available.<sup><a href="#footnote-275" id="footnote-ref-275">[275]</a></sup> If your county doesn’t have ballots in your native language, you can bring an interpreter with you to vote (so long as this person isn’t your employer or labor union officer).<sup><a href="#footnote-276" id="footnote-ref-276">[276]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152755"></a>I can’t read, and/or I physically can’t vote by myself. Can I get help in the voting booth?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. If you can’t mark a ballot because you can’t read, and/or because you have a disability, tell a poll worker when you get to your voting location (“polling place”).</p>
                <ol class="text">You have the right to use a voting machine that is accessible to you. Poll workers should explain how to use the voting equipment before you go into the booth, and should also provide further help if you need it after you go into the booth. They are legally required to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-277" id="footnote-ref-277">[277]</a></sup>You also have the right to select up to 2 people (including a poll worker) to help you in the booth, as long as these people aren’t your employer, agents of your employer, or officers/agents of your labor union.<sup><a href="#footnote-278" id="footnote-ref-278">[278]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448152756"></a>What could happen if I voted in an election that I was not legally allowed to vote in? </h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. If you ACCIDENTALLY voted in an election that you were not allowed to vote in, you will probably not be in trouble with the law. Voter fraud requires “specific intent,”<sup><a href="#footnote-279" id="footnote-ref-279">[279]</a></sup> which means you meant to vote in an election, knowing you weren’t allowed. But if you PURPOSEFULLY voted in an election, knowing you were not supposed to vote, you could be found guilty of voter fraud.<sup><a href="#footnote-280" id="footnote-ref-280">[280]</a></sup></p>

This may include information about where you were living from the ages of 18 to 25, whether you thought you were already registered, and/or why you weren’t aware of the registration requirement.<sup><a href="#footnote-307" id="footnote-ref-307">[307]</a></sup> </p>

                <p class="text">If you are in reentry, you have quickly realized how important these various forms of identification (“ID”) and other key documents are to rebuilding your life, your identity, and your sense of self.To review, the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER covered the following topics:</p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Birth CertificateSocial Security Number (SSN) &amp; CardCalifornia State ID, Drivers License, and Municipal IDU.S. PassportLibrary CardVoter RegistrationSelective Service Registration</strong></p>
                <p class="text">We hope this Chapter has empowered you to gather the important documents and ID you need to start over strong—and to better understand the different processes and issues that might come up along the way, so you can plan ahead.<em>Another important set of documents—not covered in this Chapter—are copies of your criminal records.</em> It is important to know what could show up from your criminal record as you apply for public benefits, programs, housing, and jobs; how to spot and fix errors; and how to get help making your record less visible and less powerful by “cleaning” it up. Criminal records are so important in reentry that we have written an entire chapter of this legal guide dedicated just to them. Go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029, to learn more.Congratulations on all you have accomplished!

You can:</p>

                <p class="text">Let the Vital Statistics office in the state where you were born know that you are trying to get an <em>authorized certified copy</em> of your birth certificate. Ask (1) what their procedures are; (2) what you need to send the Vital Statistics Office; and (3) the cost.</p>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE IF YOU ONLY HAVE A PRISON/JAIL ID CARD: </strong></p>
                <p><strong>If the only identification (ID) that you currently have is a valid Prison Identification Card, it may be enough in some states to request your birth certificate. First, call the State where you were born, follow the instructions to be connected to an operator, and confirm what document you need to provide to get your <em>certified Birth Certificate</em>. </strong></p>
                <p><strong>If you only have a Prison ID Card, here are a few examples of what states will ask you to provide in addition to that card:</strong></p>
                <ol class="text">Idaho and Delaware accept a current Prison Identification Card (not older than the current year), with a photo on it, to be copied and sent along with your application and payment for a birth certificate. Arizona, on the other hand, needs only a notarized signature along with full payment, and does not require a copy of your Prison/Jail ID card.Oregon requires a combination of documents, including the following: (1) official court papers, (2) parole or probation paperwork, (3) your full name, (4) your date of birth, and (5) a photo identification (your Prison/Jail ID Card is acceptable). If you have them, Oregon will also accept a Utility Bill, Vehicle Registration Paperwork, and/or Hospital Card to help prove who you are. The point is, it’s best to call ahead and ask!</ol>

                <p class="text">A misdemeanor conviction does not affect your right to vote at all. You can vote in all elections.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">What are my voting rights if I have a felony? </div>
                <p class="text">If you have a felony conviction, you can vote IF:</p>
                <ol class="text">you are on probation, even if you are in county jail as a condition of your probation, or you have completed your probation, oryou are awaiting a judge’s decision on a probation violation, or you have completed mandatory supervision, oryou have completed post-release community supervision, oryou have completed your parole.</ol>
                <p class="text">The only time you are not allowed to vote is IF:</p>

                <p class="text">Once you have completed your prison sentence and parole or other community supervision, you can register to vote. If you are unsure what type of sentence you are serving check with your parole or probation officer.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">Can I vote when I am on probation?</div>
                <p class="text">Yes! You can vote at all times when you are on probation, whether your conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">Can I vote when I am on parole?</div>
                <p class="text">No. You can only vote once you have completed your parole.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">Can I vote on mandatory supervision?</div>
                <p class="text">No. You can only vote once you have completed your mandatory supervision.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">Can I vote while I am on post-release community supervision?</div>

                <div class="textstrongemphasis">How do I get back my right to vote?</div>
                <p class="text">In California, you do not need to do anything to “restore” your right to vote. It is automatically restored once you have completed your parole and no longer in state prison. However, you must register or re-register to vote in an upcoming election.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">How do I register to vote?</div>
                <p class="text">There are two ways to register to vote:</p>
                <ol class="text">You can register online at our website, <a href="http://www.letmevoteca.org">www.letmevoteca.org</a>You can pick up a paper registration form at the DMV, post office, public libraries, or your county elections office. Complete the form, sign it, and drop it in the mail!</ol>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">Do I need to re-register if I move or change my name?</div>
                <p class="text">Yes. You need to re-register (using either of the methods above) if you move or change your name.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">How and where do I vote?</div>
                <p class="text">In California, you can vote two ways: <span class="emphasisitalic">Vote-by-Mail</span>: This means that every election your ballot will be mailed to you and you can take your time to fill it out and mail back your vote. It’s easy to become a vote-by-mail voter. Either: (1) put your initials on line 15 on your voter registration application, or (2) if you are already registered to vote, you will get a vote-by-mail application attached to the sample ballot you receive about a month before the election. Complete this application and mail back to your county election official.Reminder! A vote-by-mail ballot will be mailed to the address you provide on your voter registration. If you move a lot, this may not be the best option for you.<span class="emphasisitalic">At your local polling place</span>: Once you are registered to vote, you can vote at your local polling place on Election Day. Your local polling place is listed on the Sample Ballot you receive in the mail. If for any reason you are unsure of your polling place, you can look it up at <a href="http://www.votersedge.org">http://www.votersedge.org</a> or contact your local county elections office to find out.</p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">When is the last day to register to vote?</div>
                <p class="text">You must register (or re-register, if you’ve moved or changed your name, or if your right to vote has been restored) at least 15 days before the next local, state, or federal election. </p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">If you have a misdemeanor conviction, you can always vote.</div>
                <p class="text">In fact, you can always keep your right to vote unless you are currently serving a sentence for certain felonies </p>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">If you have a felony conviction, you can vote if:</div>
                <ol class="text">You are on probation ORyou have completed your post-release community supervision ORyou have completed your mandatory supervision ORyou have completed parole</ol>
                <p class="text">Your voting rights are automatically returned when you complete your sentence. You just have to fill out a voter registration card. </p>
