          <h1>On what basis can the BPH decide to keep me on parole past my PDD instead of letting me off early?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152799"></a>On what basis can the BPH decide to keep me on parole past my PDD instead of letting me off early?</h3>
          <p class="text">The BPH must have “good cause” to keep you on parole past your presumptive discharge date (PDD), if you are entitled to one.<sup><a href="#footnote-415" id="footnote-ref-415">[397]</a></sup> The law sets out broad factors that may count as “good cause” to keep you on parole — such as your original crime, in-prison behavior, and parole adjustment (defined on PG. 171 above).<sup><a href="#footnote-416" id="footnote-ref-416">[398]</a></sup> At this time, there are no published court cases challenging a BPH finding of good cause for keeping someone on parole, so unfortunately there isn’t much legal guidance. If you are trying to challenge a finding of good cause, it may help for you to show the BPH as much evidence as possible that you have adjusted well to parole, followed all your parole conditions, made efforts to pay off your restitution, complied with any registration requirements, and made significant efforts to turn your life around (both in prison and after release) since your commitment offense. Include documentation of any employment, education or training, as well as certificates for completing programs that helped you improve yourself or learn new skills.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152800"></a>What happens if the BPH decides to continue my parole? </h3>
          <p class="text">If the BPH decides to continue your parole past your PDD, you should be reviewed for possible discharge each year until your maximum discharge date (MDD) is reached.<sup><a href="#footnote-417" id="footnote-ref-417">[399]</a></sup> At these annual review dates, you will remain on parole unless the BPH takes action to discharge you.<sup><a href="#footnote-418" id="footnote-ref-418">[400]</a></sup></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152801"></a>Can<a id="canichallengebph"></a> I appeal the BPH’s decision to keep me on parole past my PDD? </h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">REMINDER! you can challenge factual mistakes in your parole agent’s discharge review report</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">If your parole agent or parole staff makes a FACTUAL MISTAKE in a recommendation to the BPH about whether or not you should be discharged early, you can challenge that mistake through a 602 appeal (see PG. 171 for that process). (15 Cal. Code Regs. § 3723).</p>
          <p class="text">Yes. Since you are challenging a decision by the BPH, not a decision by Parole, you do NOT need to file a 602 appeal. You can challenge the BPH decision directly in state court.<sup><a href="#footnote-419" id="footnote-ref-419">[401]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">If there was no mistake in Parole’s report/recommendations to the BPH, but you still want to challenge the BPH’s decision to keep you on parole past your PDD because you don’t think they had good cause, then there is no administrative appeals process for challenging the BPH’s decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-420" id="footnote-ref-420">[402]</a></sup> Instead, you will go straight to filing a writ of habeas corpus in the state superior court where your parole is located to challenge the BPH’s decision. </p>
