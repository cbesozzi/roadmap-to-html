  <h1>Can my U.S. probation officer send me back to prison?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153036"></a>Can my U.S. probation officer send me back to prison?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">No, your probation officer cannot send you back to prison, but it is part of the officer’s job to tell the court about a violation of your conditions. The judge at court, however, usually CAN send you back to prison.</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><strong>MINOR VIOLATIONS:</strong> Typically, if your probation officer learns of a minor violation of a condition, or believes that a violation is likely to happen, the officer will discuss with you how to avoid a more serious problem. Alternatively, the probation officer might ask the judge to modify your conditions of Federal Probation or Supervised Release. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><strong>SERIOUS or REPEATED VIOLATIONS:</strong> After a serious violation or repeated violations, your probation officer may tell a judge about these violations and request revocation of your Federal Probation/Supervised Release. If this happens, you have the right to a revocation hearing, at which the judge may decide to revoke your Federal Probation/Supervised Release and send you back to prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-885" id="footnote-ref-885">[859]</a></sup> </ol>
