        <h1>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get SSDI?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153349"></a>Can my criminal history limit my ability to get SSDI?</h3>
        <p class="text">Possibly—but this could be just temporary. You can’t get Social Security benefits for any month that you:<sup><a href="#footnote-1601" id="footnote-ref-1601">[1571]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text">Are confined in a correctional facility for a period of 30+ days in a row due to a conviction;<sup><a href="#footnote-1602" id="footnote-ref-1602">[1572]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Are confined to an institution by court order because you’ve been found “guilty” but insane, “not guilty” due to insanity or mental illness, or “incompetent to stand trial”;<sup><a href="#footnote-1603" id="footnote-ref-1603">[1573]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Have an open arrest warrant because you’re avoiding prosecution or confinement for a felony; or</ol>
        <ol class="text">Are found to be violating a condition of probation or parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-1604" id="footnote-ref-1604">[1574]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Here is an example of how this works: </em>If you were convicted and confined on March 29, 2014 and stayed in jail until May 2, 2014, you weren’t entitled to benefits for the months of March, April, or May since you were being confined for 35 days in a row.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1605" id="footnote-ref-1605">[1575]</a></sup></sup> This means you can’t collect back payments for any SSDI benefits you otherwise would have received if you never had a conviction, warrant, violation, and/or period of confinement as described above.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1606" id="footnote-ref-1606">[1576]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">Also, you CAN’T apply for any Social Security benefits based on a disability that is related to a felony you committed. For example, if you fell while committing a felony and lost your ability to walk as a result, that disability won’t qualify you for SSDI.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1607" id="footnote-ref-1607">[1577]</a></sup></sup> But you could still apply for SSDI based on a disability that has no connection to your felony.</ol>
        <p class="text">Once you qualify for SSDI, you stay enrolled as long as you still have a qualifying disability. Although your benefits get suspended (paused) during incarceration, they won’t get terminated (permanently ended) due to your incarceration.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1608" id="footnote-ref-1608">[1578]</a></sup></sup> This means that if your spouse or children have been getting benefits as your dependents based on your SSDI eligibility, they’ll keep getting these benefits while you’re incarcerated, as long as they stay eligible.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1609" id="footnote-ref-1609">[1579]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">If you’re currently incarcerated for 30 or more days, and you were already getting SSDI when you were arrested, then your SSDI was suspended on your 31st day of incarceration.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1610" id="footnote-ref-1610">[1580]</a></sup></sup> But you can apply to restart your SSDI benefits once you have documents showing your release date (see PG. 601). If you weren’t on SSDI when you were arrested, and being incarcerated is the only factor disqualifying you now, you can start a new application for SSDI before your release (see PG. 583).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1611" id="footnote-ref-1611">[1581]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <h4 class="textbox">IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONSExceptions for People Incarcerated Before April 1, 2000—What happened to your SSDI during incarceration:</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">If you were incarcerated between February 1, 1995 and March 31, 2000: You’re not entitled to SSDI benefits for any month in which you were incarcerated following conviction of a crime punishable by more than a one-year statutory sentence, regardless of the actual sentence imposed by the court. If you were incarcerated before February 1, 1995: Your SSDI benefits get suspended after your 31<sup>st</sup> day of incarceration only if you were convicted of a felony.If you were incarcerated before April 1, 2000: Your SSDI benefits didn’t get suspended if you were confined by court order because you were found to be “not guilty” due to insanity, “guilty” but insane, or “incompetent to stand trial.<sup><a href="#footnote-1612" id="footnote-ref-1612">[1582]</a></sup></ul>

        <p class="sidebox">As soon as you know that you will be incarcerated for 30 or more days, you should report this fact to Social Security so that your benefits get suspended in a timely way.

        <p class="text">Many people who apply for SSDI are denied at first, but then get benefits once they appeal. Considering the small odds of getting approved on the first try, be prepared to get denied and to go through the appeals process.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1635" id="footnote-ref-1635">[1605]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="text">If Social Security decides to deny your SSDI application, it must mail you a notice of this decision. </p>
        <ol class="text">You have a right to appeal. To do so, you must file a “Request for Reconsideration” within 60 days after the date you received the notice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1636" id="footnote-ref-1636">[1606]</a></sup> You can send it by mail, but it’s best to file it in person at a local Social Security office. This way you get a copy with a time-and-date stamp, which proves that you appealed on time.<sup><a href="#footnote-1637" id="footnote-ref-1637">[1607]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You can also appeal online at: <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/iAppeals/ap001.jsp">https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/iAppeals/ap001.jsp</a></ol>
        <ol class="text">If you miss the 60-day deadline due to factors beyond your control, like illness or hospitalization, file a request for a “good cause exception” to the deadline along with your “Request for Reconsideration.<sup><a href="#footnote-1638" id="footnote-ref-1638">[1608]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">If Social Security then decides to deny your Request for Reconsideration, it must mail you a notice of this decision.</p>
        <ol class="text">Again, you have a right to appeal. To do so, you must file a “Request for an Administrative Law Judge Hearing” within 60 days after the date you got the notice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1639" id="footnote-ref-1639">[1609]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">If you can’t afford a lawyer to help with your appeal, you may be able to find free help by contacting a local legal aid office, a local bar association referral services, or another local nonprofit organization that helps with Social Security issues.<sup><a href="#footnote-1640" id="footnote-ref-1640">[1610]</a></sup></p>
        <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintsSSDI Back-payments</h4>
        <p class="textbox">You can’t get back-payments of SSDI for the months you spent in prison or jail. In other words, you can never collect SSDI checks you otherwise would have gotten if you weren’t incarcerated. However, you should be able to collect back-payments of SSDI dating back to the month following the month of your release.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">Getting SSDI on the Day You Apply</h4>
        <p class="textbox">In SPECIAL EMERGENCY CASES, you may be able to get benefits on the day you walk into the local Social Security office to complete your SSDI paperwork. This may be possible if:(1) your SSDI was only suspended and not terminated during your incarceration, <em>or</em> you’ve already filed a new SSDI application before your release; (2) you can show proof of a financial emergency; and(3) you haven’t already received benefits for the month.</p>
