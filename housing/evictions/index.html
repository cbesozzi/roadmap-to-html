          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="HS_Eviction"></a><a id="_Toc448153241"></a>Evictions</h2>
          <p class="text">The HOUSING CHAPTER does NOT go into the specifics of eviction law—but we realize it is an issue you may come across and need help with. Below we include some very basic know-your-rights information if you are facing an eviction or received what is called a “3-Day Notice” from your landlord to do something (like pay rent).</p>
          <p class="text">It’s also important to know that if you engage in any “new criminal activity,” like committing a new crime, you and your entire household could face eviction.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1291" id="footnote-ref-1291">[1261]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
          <p class="text"><em>If you need a lawyer to help with defending against an eviction, please see the list of housing legal aid providers on PG. 1286, who may be able to assist you. </em></p>
          <p class="text"><em>If you are facing eviction, it’s important to ACT FAST to respond to the notice of eviction, so get in touch with a housing lawyer as soon as possible.</em></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153242"></a>What is an eviction? </h3>
          <p class="text"><em>Eviction</em> is a process that a landlord can use to remove a tenant from a rental unit. The fancy legal term for an eviction lawsuit is an “unlawful detainer” action. It is called “unlawful detainer” because the landlord is accusing the tenant of staying in a rental unit when he or she does not have a legal right to do so, therefore, the rental unit is unlawfully detained. To “be evicted” means (1) you were the defendant (the renter who is being accused of unlawfully staying in the rental unit) in this type of lawsuit, (2) you lost the lawsuit, and (3) the court then ordered you to move out of the apartment or rental unit. If you leave a rental unit because the landlord asks you to do so, but you are never served with “unlawful detainer” eviction court papers, then you have not been evicted in the legal sense of the word.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1292" id="footnote-ref-1292">[1262]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
