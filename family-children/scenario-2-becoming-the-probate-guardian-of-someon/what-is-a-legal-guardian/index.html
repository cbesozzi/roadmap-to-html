  <p>
    What is a legal guardian?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a legal guardian, you are responsible for caring for and making decisions for the child, including:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Where the child lives;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Education;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Health care;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Social services;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Financial support and/or public benefits;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Supervision and misconduct;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Driver license; military service; and marriage;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any other responsibilities that the judge orders. [2317]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Guardianship may look different depending on what court you are in. This section focuses on guardianships through probate court. To learn what guardianship looks like through a juvenile dependency court, visit PG. 932.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why would I go to probate court to become the guardian of someone else’s child?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes a parent cannot take care of a child. Typical reasons include:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Serious physical or mental illness;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Military service and have to go overseas;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In-patient rehabilitative treatment;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Incarceration;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Drug or alcohol abuse problem;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    History of being abusive; or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cannot take care of their child for some other reason.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A legal guardian can take care of a child when a parent is unable to until the parent is able to take care of the child again or a more permanent situation is made such as adoption.
