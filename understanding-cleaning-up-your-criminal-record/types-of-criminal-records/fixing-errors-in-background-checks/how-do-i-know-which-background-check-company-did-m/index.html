          <h1>How do I know which background check company did my background check?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153889"></a>How do I know which background check company did my background check?</h3>
          <p class="text">There are two ways to find out which background check company ran your report and how to contact them:</p>
          <ol class="text">BEFORE someone runs a background check on you (such as an employer, private landlord, or creditor), generally they must TELL YOU that they are going to get a background check on you and get your PERMISSION. They must also give you the name, address, phone number, and website of the background check company that they are going to use.<sup><a href="#footnote-2906" id="footnote-ref-2906">[2872]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If someone takes a harmful action against you (such as refusing to hire you, rent you an apartment, or give you benefits) based on information in your background check, they must give you an “ADVERSE ACTION LETTER” with the name, address, and phone number of the company used.<sup><a href="#footnote-2907" id="footnote-ref-2907">[2873]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text">You have the right to know what internal procedures the background company uses to investigate your claim. You can ask the company for this information and they MUST provide it to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2908" id="footnote-ref-2908">[2874]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="textbox"><strong>A NOTE ABOUT CHALLENGING INFORMATION IN YOUR BACKGROUND CHECK REPORT:</strong> Under the law, you have the right to challenge any information in your background check, and there is a specific process for doing it. However, in practice, it might not be as easy or straightforward, especially if the background check company is uncooperative or unresponsive. If you have trouble getting the company to review or change the wrong information in your file, it is recommended that you contact a lawyer for help. </p>
          <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153890"></a>WARRANTS</h3>
          <h3>What is a warrant and why is it important?</h3>
          <p class="text">Generally, a warrant is a legal order that gives law enforcement the authority to arrest you for various reasons, such as you missed a criminal court date or are suspected of a crime.  If you have an outstanding warrant this  means that the police can take you into custody at any time – including during a routine traffic stop, at your home, or when you appear in court for another matter. If you do not take care of the warrant, you will constantly have to worry that you may unexpectedly be taken to jail. For this reason, it is important to determine whether or not you have any outstanding warrants before getting your criminal record expunged. (See PG. X)</p>
          <p class="text">Additionally, if you have an outstanding warrant, it could impact other areas of your life, such as your ability to get public benefits, public housing, or a passport. </p>
          <h3>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT WARRANTS I might HAVE ON MY RECORD?</h3>
          <p class="text"><strong>Arrest Warrant:  </strong>An arrest warrant is issued after a grand jury or law enforcement officials have probable cause to suspect that you have committed a crime. Probable cause is a reasonable belief that something illegal took place.<sup><a href="#footnote-2909" id="footnote-ref-2909">[2875]</a></sup>  A judge will issue an arrest warrant for you if the judge determines a crime has been committed and that “there is reasonable ground to believe” that you committed the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-2910" id="footnote-ref-2910">[2876]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Bench Warrant</strong>:  A bench warrant is the most common warrant issued in California. It is typically issued when a person fails to appear for a court hearing or fails to answer a subpoena. A bench warrant can be issued for the following reasons:</p>
          <p class="text">Failure to pay a fine;</p>
          <p class="text">Failure to appear after an indictment on criminal charges where the court has a fixed date and place for an appearance by the defendant;</p>
          <p class="text">Failure to appear in court after an attorney and judge personally order the defendant to appear;</p>
          <p class="text">Failure to appear in court and show proof of enrollment, progress or completion of community service or other alternative sentencing; and</p>
          <p class="text">Failure to appear (FTA) in court after citation by police officer.</p>
          <p class="text">A bench warrant gives police the authority to automatically arrest someone. If you are arrested on a bench warrant a bail amount will be set. This means you likely will sit in jail until you appear in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2911" id="footnote-ref-2911">[2877]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">In serious criminal cases, a failure to appear will most likely cause the court to issue a “regular” arrest warrant, which means the police may immediately try to find and jail the defendant. A bench warrant, on the other hand, usually doesn’t trigger immediate police action. Instead, your name goes into a statewide computer system that serves the entire law enforcement community. Once your name is in the database, if you have to deal with the police for any reason – even when you’re not at fault – you can (and likely will) be taken into custody for the outstanding bench warrant.<sup><a href="#footnote-2912" id="footnote-ref-2912">[2878]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><strong>Parole Warrant</strong>:  If you don't meet your parole agent when you're supposed to, the agent can have a warrant issued. If you're considered a potential threat to public safety, the California Parole Apprehension Team will be sent to find you. A warrant can also be issued if the Board of Parole Hearings determines that you have violated your parole terms. </p>
          <p class="text">In practice, not all parole violations are serious enough to get your parole revoked. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has developed a Parole Violation Decision Making Instrument to help parole agents determine whether parole should be revoked or not. If the agent recommends that your parole should be revoked, the Board of Parole Hearings can issue a warrant. <sup><a href="#footnote-2913" id="footnote-ref-2913">[2879]</a></sup></p>
          <h3>HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT?</h3>
          <p class="text">One way to know whether you have an outstanding warrant is to search for your city, county, or state's official website and look for a link for a warrant search. You will know it is an official government website if it ends in .gov. </p>
          <p class="text">A court website may have a searchable public records section with information about outstanding warrants available to the general public. You can do a search on your name and the website will bring up any warrants under that name.  Please note that not every city, county, or state will have this option on their website. If the government entities have small budgets or low population there is a good chance the warrant online search option may not be available.<sup><a href="#footnote-2914" id="footnote-ref-2914">[2880]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"> <br/>If the website doesn’t have a searchable public records section, you can call the clerk of court or county clerk.  When you call the clerk of the court, ask if there is an outstanding warrant for “Person X” (your name) in a criminal or civil case. Have your name, birth date, and if possible, your case number and Social Security number, in hand. Avoid identifying yourself as the person for whom a warrant was issued. You should not have trouble getting an answer about a criminal case, since most data in criminal cases are public records.<br/></p>
          <h3>HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT IN A FEDERAL CASE?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you want to know whether you have an outstanding warrant in a federal case, call the federal clerk of court for your district. If you are uneasy about calling the clerk of court yourself, you can have another person call for you. This can be a friend, relative, attorney, or bail bondsman. </p>
          <p class="text">Another option is to go to the courthouse and look up your name in their public records, which are usually filed on computers. If it's possible, have another person do this for you - if you have an outstanding warrant, you risk being taken into custody by the courthouse's security officers.</p>
          <p class="text">You may have multiple outstanding warrants out for your arrest in different federal circuits. The clerk of court for one circuit may not be able to tell you whether you have an warrant in another circuit. Consider working with a bail bondsman or an attorney to determine if you have multiple warrants.</p>
          <h3>HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I HAVE A PAROLE WARRANT?</h3>
          <p class="text">Your relationship with your parole agent is key to staying out of prison. If you have missed a meeting, the first thing you should do is to call your parole office and ask your parole agent for instructions. </p>
          <p class="text">You can reach the office for California's Northern Region at 916-255-2758 and the Southern Region office at 909-468-2300. These offices should be able to give you the phone number for your local parole office in northern or southern California if you don't already have it.</p>
          <p class="text">If you think a warrant has already been issued, you can call the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at 916-445-6713.  </p>
          <h3>I FOUND OUT I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT. WHAT CAN I DO?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you have an outstanding warrant, you have a few options. Depending on what the warrant is for, you may be able to take care of it by simply showing up in court and paying a fine. The court clerk may be able to tell you what you need to do to take care of the warrant. You should check with a lawyer before you show up at the courthouse though, as you risk being taken into custody when you identify yourself there. </p>
          <p class="text">In some cases, it is better to have a lawyer take care of the warrant for you. If you don't take care of your warrant, you risk being taken into custody the next time you come in contact with the police. Police contact during traffic stops which result in arrests for warrants are very common. Call a lawyer to make sure this doesn't happen to you. <br/></p>
