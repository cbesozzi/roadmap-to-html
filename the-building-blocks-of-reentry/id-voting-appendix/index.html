</p>

<p>
  A Listing of Vital Statistics Office Phone Numbers for Each State
</p>

<p>
  For people born outside of California in the U.S., this Appendix provides a chart that contact information for the Vital Statistics Office (also called Vital Records Office) in each state. However, because these addresses and phone numbers are subject to change, you should check with the CDC for the most up-to-date information. You can:
</p>

<p>
  Visit the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w.htm
</p>

<p>
  Call the CDC directly by phone at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636)
</p>

<p>
  OR
</p>

<p>
  Write to the CDC at:	
</p>

<p>
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention1600 Clifton RoadAtlanta, GA 30329-4027
</p>

<p>
  Once you locate the Vital Statistics Office in the state where you were born, let them know that you are trying to get an authorized certified copy of your birth certificate. Ask (1) what their procedures are; (2) what you need to send the Vital Statistics Office; and (3) the cost.
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT NOTE IF YOU ONLY HAVE A PRISON/JAIL ID CARD: 
</p>

<p>
  If the only identification (ID) that you currently have is a valid prison ID card, it may be enough in some states to request your birth certificate. First, call the state where you were born, follow the instructions to be connected to an operator, and confirm what document you need to provide to get your certified birth certificate. 
</p>

<p>
  If you only have a prison ID card, here are a few examples of what states will ask you to provide in addition to that card:
</p>

<p>
  Idaho and Delaware accept a current prison ID card (not older than the current year), with a photo on it, to be copied and sent with your application and payment for a birth certificate. 
</p>

<p>
  Arizona, on the other hand, needs only a notarized signature along with full payment, and does not require a copy of your prison/jail ID card.
</p>

<p>
  Oregon requires a combination of documents, including the following: (1) official court papers, (2) parole or probation paperwork, (3) your full name, (4) your date of birth, and (5) a photo identification (your prison/jail ID Card is acceptable). If you have them, Oregon will also accept a utility bill, vehicle registration paperwork, and/or hospital card to help prove who you are. 
</p>

<p>
  The point is, it’s best to call ahead and ask!

<p>
  Western Union is the only payment option to pay your court-ordered debt (COD) to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) offers to expedite the release of your driver license. If you have any other referring court-ordered liabilities, they must also be paid. To expedite (speed up) the release of your license:
</p>

<p>
  Call the referring office that placed the hold on your driver license and ask: “Does your office accept Western Union payment in full through the California Franchise Tax Board’s COD account to expedite the release of my license?” 
</p>

<p>
  If the answer is yes, then pay your COD account in full through Western Union and provide COD with the Western Union Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN).
</p>

<p>
  If the answer is no, ask the referring office if they accept other payment options to expedite the release.

<p>
  Frequently Asked Questions
</p>

<p>
  What are my voting rights if I have a misdemeanor?
</p>

<p>
  A misdemeanor conviction does not affect your right to vote at all. You can vote in all elections.
</p>

<p>
  What are my voting rights if I have a felony? 
</p>

<p>
  If you have a felony conviction, you can vote IF:
</p>

<p>
  you are on probation, even if you are in county jail as a condition of your probation, or 
</p>

<p>
  you have completed your probation, or
</p>

<p>
  you are awaiting a judge’s decision on a probation violation, or 
</p>

<p>
  you have completed mandatory supervision, or
</p>

<p>
  you have completed post-release community supervision, or
</p>

<p>
  you have completed your parole.
</p>

<p>
  The only time you are not allowed to vote is IF:
</p>

<p>
  you have a felony conviction and you are still in state prison, or
</p>

<p>
  you are serving an 1170(h) felony sentence in county jail, or 
</p>

<p>
  you are awaiting transfer to a state prison, or 
</p>

<p>
  you are on parole, on post-release community supervision, or on mandatory supervision.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have completed your prison sentence and parole or other community supervision, you can register to vote. If you are unsure what type of sentence you are serving check with your parole or probation officer.
</p>

<p>
  Can I vote when I am on probation?
</p>

<p>
  Yes! You can vote at all times when you are on probation, whether your conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor.
</p>

<p>
  Can I vote when I am on parole?
</p>

<p>
  No. You can only vote once you have completed your parole.
</p>

<p>
  Can I vote on mandatory supervision?
</p>

<p>
  No. You can only vote once you have completed your mandatory supervision.
</p>

<p>
  Can I vote while I am on post-release community supervision?
</p>

<p>
  No. You can only vote once you have completed your post-release community supervision.
</p>

<p>
  Can I vote while I am in county jail? Maybe. You can vote IF you are in county jail:
</p>

<p>
  awaiting trial for any crime, or
</p>

<p>
  for a misdemeanor conviction, or
</p>

<p>
   on a probation violation, or
</p>

<p>
   on formal probation.
</p>

<p>
  The only time you lose the right to vote while in county jail is when you are: 
</p>

<p>
  in state prison for a felony conviction, or 
</p>

<p>
  in jail awaiting transfer to a state prison for a felony conviction, or
</p>

<p>
   serving an 1170(h) felony sentence in the county jail, or
</p>

<p>
  in jail for a parole violation.
</p>

<p>
  How do I get back my right to vote?
</p>

<p>
  In California, you do not need to do anything to “restore” your right to vote. It is automatically restored once you have completed your parole and no longer in state prison. However, you must register or re-register to vote in an upcoming election.
</p>

<p>
  How do I register to vote?
</p>

<p>
  There are two ways to register to vote:
</p>

<p>
  You can register online at our website, www.letmevoteca.org
</p>

<p>
  You can pick up a paper registration form at the DMV, post office, public libraries, or your county elections office. Complete the form, sign it, and drop it in the mail!
</p>

<p>
  Do I need to re-register if I move or change my name?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. You need to re-register (using either of the methods above) if you move or change your name.
</p>

<p>
  How and where do I vote?
</p>

<p>
  In California, you can vote two ways: 
</p>

<p>
  Vote-by-Mail: This means that every election your ballot will be mailed to you and you can take your time to fill it out and mail back your vote. It’s easy to become a vote-by-mail voter. Either: (1) put your initials on line 15 on your voter registration application, or (2) if you are already registered to vote, you will get a vote-by-mail application attached to the sample ballot you receive about a month before the election. Complete this application and mail back to your county election official.
</p>

<p>
  Reminder! A vote-by-mail ballot will be mailed to the address you provide on your voter registration. If you move a lot, this may not be the best option for you.
</p>

<p>
  At your local polling place: Once you are registered to vote, you can vote at your local polling place on Election Day. Your local polling place is listed on the Sample Ballot you receive in the mail. If for any reason you are unsure of your polling place, you can look it up at http://www.votersedge.org or contact your local county elections office to find out.
</p>

<p>
  When is the last day to register to vote?
</p>

<p>
  You must register (or re-register, if you’ve moved or changed your name, or if your right to vote has been restored) at least 15 days before the next local, state, or federal election. 
</p>

<p>
  If you have a misdemeanor conviction, you can always vote.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, you can always keep your right to vote unless you are currently serving a sentence for certain felonies. 
</p>

<p>
  If you have a felony conviction, you can vote if:
</p>

<p>
  You are on probation OR
</p>

<p>
  you have completed your post-release community supervision OR
</p>

<p>
  you have completed your mandatory supervision OR
</p>

<p>
  you have completed parole
</p>

<p>
  Your voting rights are automatically returned when you complete your sentence. You just have to fill out a voter registration card.
