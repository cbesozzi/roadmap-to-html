          <h3><a id="_Toc448153156"></a>What is “proof of mitigating factors?”</h3>
          <p class="text"><em>“Proof of mitigating factors”</em> is extra information and evidence that explains that the PHA or landlord should not view the offense or conduct as negatively as it might otherwise. You can submit things like:</p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">WARNING ABOUT what information you share with landlords:</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">If you are applying to private housing, be careful not to share any more information than necessary—see PG. 425 to understand what criminal record information a private landlord can access, and see PG. 408 to learn ways you can identify illegal discrimination by private landlords (which has a different legal standard than discrimination by government-assisted housing providers and Public Housing Authorities (PHA).</p>
          <ol class="text">A period of time has passed since your conviction or criminal activity (the crime was not very recent);</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were convicted at a young age;</ol>
          <ol class="text">The nature and extent of your conduct are less involved (like showing you were not as involved in the offense/ conduct as one might think);</ol>
          <ol class="text">Physical or emotional abuse, coercion, or untreated abuse or mental illness that led to the conviction (and any of these factors might have led to the crime/offense);</ol>
          <ol class="text">Disabilities that you or a family member has that might have led to the conviction; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Any additional context for the conviction (other factors that would help explain the circumstances you were in when the offense occurred and why it should be viewed with more leniency).</ol>
