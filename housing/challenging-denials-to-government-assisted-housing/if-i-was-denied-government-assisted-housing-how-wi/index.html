          <p class="text">If you were denied housing due to <em>information that showed up in your criminal record</em>, then the PHA also MUST give you a copy of the criminal record it used. This will help you to understand why you were denied.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1267" id="footnote-ref-1267">[1237]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
          <p class="text">Furthermore, if you are denied admission to federal government-assisted housing, you have the right to WRITTEN <em>detailed notice of the denial</em>—THIS SHOULD EXPLAIN THE SPECIFIC REASON(S) YOU WERE DENIED!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1268" id="footnote-ref-1268">[1238]</a></sup></sup> Sometimes, PHAs and owners will give you a general notice just telling you that you were denied, but not the specific conduct or offense that was the basis for the decision. If you get a general notice without the important details, you should ask for the detailed notice—which you have the right to! The PHA or owner of government-assisted housing MUST provide you with a detailed notice by law.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1269" id="footnote-ref-1269">[1239]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Challenging the rejection may give you the necessary time to improve or gather information to clarify your criminal history. If you haven’t already done so, you should request a copy of your criminal record and try to correct any mistakes. [CROSS-REFERENCE TO RECORD-CLEANING SECTION] You should also gather evidence of rehabilitation and mitigating evidence.</p>
