          <h3><a id="_Toc448153408"></a>How can employers learn about my criminal record?</h3>
          <p class="text">There are three main ways an employer can access information about your criminal history:</p>
          <ol class="text"><em>The employer can ask you about it.</em> Some employers will ask you directly if you have a criminal record. For this reason, it is important that you know your rights about what can be asked and what you have to answer. See PG. 708 to learn more.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>The employer can pay a private background check company to run a background check report on you.</em> Background check companies are private companies that create background check reports for employers. This is the most common way for an employer to find out information about your past because it is easy, fast, and usually done online. See PG. 726 to learn more. </ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>The employer can conduct an “in house” background check.</em> Some employers will do their own background check and look up your public records, research you online, and call your friends, family members, and former employers to ask about you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1779" id="footnote-ref-1779">[1749]</a></sup> See PG. 720 to learn more.</ol>
