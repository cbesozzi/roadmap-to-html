          <h3><a id="_Toc448153093"></a>I have a disability. What rights do I have on federal probation or parole to have accommodations for my disability?</h3>
          <p>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects individuals on federal probation/federal parole from discrimination due to their disabilities.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1018" id="footnote-ref-1018">[992]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p>The Rehabilitation Act provides essentially the same protections as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including the right to <em>reasonable changes</em> in policies, rules, and conditions; <em>equal opportunity to participate</em> in programs, services, and benefits; and <em>additional assistance</em> (services or devices) so that you can participate in programs and activities related to your supervision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1019" id="footnote-ref-1019">[993]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p>Thus, federal probation staff must offer you the same types of accommodations and services discussed for state parole under “State Parole: Disabilities and the ADA,” see PG. 198.</p>
