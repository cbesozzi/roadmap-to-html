  <p>
    What is juvenile dependency court?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How is juvenile dependency court different from juvenile delinquency court?Juvenile delinquency courts are for cases where a child is charged with committing a crime. Juvenile dependency courts, on the other hand, are for cases where a parent or caregiver is suspected of abusing or neglecting a child. Sometimes, children are involved in both of these courts at the same time—if they are both being charge with a crime and there is a case of suspected child abuse or neglect by their parents. If your child is being charged with a crime, see the next section on juvenile delinquency on PG. 945.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The local county Child Protective Services (CPS) opens a case in juvenile dependency court when a child’s parent(s) or caregivers are suspected of abuse or neglect.[2336] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When would CPS get involved?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CPS gets involved in a child’s life when a parent has been violent with, abused, or neglected a child, or if the child tests positive for drugs at birth.[2337] When CPS gets involved, they may open a case in juvenile dependency court.[2338] Whether or not they open a case in dependency court depends on if CPS removed the child from his or her home. Once CPS removes the child, a case is started in juvenile dependency court.[2339] In most cases, the parent(s) will have the opportunity to get their child back if they meet certain requirements.[2340]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is considered child abuse?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under the law, abuse may be physical harm, sexual abuse, cruel or unreasonable punishment, using drugs while pregnant, and/or neglect of a child.[2341]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can CPS remove my child from my care just because I have a criminal record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No. Just having a criminal record is not enough for Child Protective Services (CPS) or a judge to take your child away—there has to be some connection between your conviction and a risk of harm to your child. For example, a conviction for child abuse, certain violent felonies, or using drug or alcohol in a way that put your child at risk could cause CPS or the judge to remove your child from your care.[2342]
