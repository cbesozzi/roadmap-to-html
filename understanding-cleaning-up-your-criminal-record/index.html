<p>
  UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  In the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, you will first learn the importance of understanding your records—where that information exists in the world, and how to fix mistakes in your record early on in reentry. In the second part of the Chapter, you will learn that you may be able to “clean up” your criminal record through different kinds of “expungement” in California. Expungement helps to protect your criminal history information and keep it out of sight for certain people. In most cases, “cleaning up” your criminal record WON’T completely erase it, but it CAN make past convictions and other criminal history less visible to many, which has many benefits in different areas of your life, including applying to housing, jobs, and more.
</p>

<p>
  DISCLAIMER – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the Roadmap to Reentry legal guide, it is your responsibility to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The Roadmap to Reentry guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.

<p>
  INTRODUCTION:
</p>

<p>
  This UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER is broken up into the following subjects:
</p>

<p>
  Key Concepts For Understanding Your Criminal Record & Fixing Errors (PG. 1138), which explains the different types of criminal records that you may have, what information can (and can’t) be included in your criminal records and on background checks, and why it’s important to review and understand your own criminal records.
</p>

<p>
  Who Can See Your Criminal Record (PG. 1152), which gives you the different rules for who CAN and CAN’T see your criminal records and/or run a background check on you (like employers, law enforcement agencies, licensing agencies, and landlords), and how they can use the information they get about you.
</p>

<p>
  How to Get Your Criminal Records (PG. 1154), which tells you how to get copies of the different types of criminal records you may have. You will need these in order to decide the best way to clean up your record.
</p>

<p>
  How to Clean Up Your Record (PG. 1157), which explains the different options, or “remedies,” available for cleaning up your record. It helps you figure out whether you and your offense are eligible for them, and walks you through how to do each one.
</p>

<p>
  If you are recently released from prison or jail, or earlier in the reentry journey, the sections about key concepts in understanding you record and fixing errors, learning who can and cannot see your criminal record information, and how you can get copies are the most important early on.
</p>

<p>
  If you are later in your reentry journey, cleaning up your record will become more important to you over time, as many of these “expungement” options are only available to people off supervision or those who are able by law to ask to get off supervision early. 
</p>

<p>
  Key Concepts for Understanding your Criminal Record & Fixing Errors—Early in Reentry 
</p>

<p>
  This is one of the most important sections for people early in their reentry journey—to better understand your criminal record, learn how to fix errors, and be prepared for what others can and cannot find out about you and your record.
</p>

<p>
  What is a criminal record? 
</p>

<p>
  Your “criminal record” is the broad term we use to include ALL of the information created about any contact you’ve had with law enforcement, the courts, or another part of the criminal justice system. Your “criminal record” includes arrests, charges filed against you, convictions, pleas, acquittals, dismissals, sentences, and any other contact you have had with law enforcement and/or the criminal justice system that was documented (written down). 
</p>

<p>
  Here are some examples of how your contact with law enforcement or the criminal justice system can get documented. All of this information is considered part of your criminal record (but note that much of it may be PROTECTED from being seen): 
</p>

<p>
  You were pulled over while driving and arrested for a DUI; 
</p>

<p>
  You received a citation for public disorderliness or having an open container in public; 
</p>

<p>
  You were arrested, and the police wrote up an arrest record;
</p>

<p>
  You were taken to jail, booked into the system, and fingerprinted;
</p>

<p>
  You were charged with a crime;
</p>

<p>
  You were arraigned (appeared before a judge) in court and pleaded guilty or not guilty;
</p>

<p>
  You were convicted of a crime and sentenced to prison or jail, and the judge wrote a sentencing order;
</p>

<p>
  You were acquitted of the charges after a trial;
</p>

<p>
  You agreed to a plea bargain with the prosecutor. In exchange, the prosecutor dismissed some of the charges against you;
</p>

<p>
  You violated your probation or parole and had your supervision revoked;
</p>

<p>
  You had your conviction dismissed or expunged
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS TO KNOW ABOUT: A lot of this information CANNOT be included in a regular background check. For more information about what information can and can’t be included in your background check, see PG. 1145.
