  <p>
    Why would I go to family court to reconnect with my child or grandchild?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may go to family court cases about divorce or separation; child support; paternity/parentage questions; and/or custody and visitation disagreements between parents or caregivers (so long as CPS is NOT involved).[2292] A family court judge may make decisions and orders related to any of these types of cases.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, in some probate court cases, the judge making decisions about a probate guardianship will transfer a case from probate court to family court if a biological parent ACTIVELY OBJECTS to the guardianship placement. The probate court tends to see this type of a dispute as a custody disagreement better suited for family courts to handle. Read more about probate court guardianships beginning on PG. 924.
