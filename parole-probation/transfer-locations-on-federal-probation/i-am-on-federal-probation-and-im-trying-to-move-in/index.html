  <p>
    I am on federal probation, and I’m trying to move in with someone who lives in government-assisted housing (like public housing, section 8, or a voucher program), can I still move in?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. If the family member or person you want to move in with lives in subsidized housing, there might be federal, state, or local laws that restrict someone on federal probation or Supervised Release from moving into the residence. It may depend on what your conviction was for. To avoid putting that person’s government- assisted housing subsidy at risk, refer to the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 368, to learn more about how your criminal record or supervision status might affect where you can live.
