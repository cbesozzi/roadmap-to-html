  <p>
    I am an undocumented person. Can I get an official form of ID?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PROOF OF RESIDENCY
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When applying for an AB 60 driver license, you will need to submit  proof that you currently live in California.  For a list of documents that meet this requirement, see APPENDIX H.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No, but you may be able to get a special type of driver license (called an “AB 60” License) approved for undocumented people to drive legally in California, and California only. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An AB 60 “Undocumented Person” driver license will NOT serve as official identification (meaning it does not establish eligibility for employment, voter registration, or public benefits), but it WILL allow you to drive a car legally in California.[6] It’s against state law for state police to discriminate against anyone driving with an AB 60 License in California, but federal agents and law enforcement agencies outside of California are NOT required to honor your AB 60 driver license. Depending on local laws and policies, you could face criminal or immigration consequences if you show your AB 60 “Undocumented” California driver license to a police officer in another state—so use it only in California! And do NOT try to use it in federal facilities, such as passing airport screenings or crossing through Customs and Border Patrols![7] Airports and Customs are federal, and they do NOT honor AB 60 license, and could use this against you.

    For more information on what it means to be an undocumented person in the United States, you can contact a referral and information hotline such as 1-888-6-CHIRLA (1-888-624-4752), provided in English and Spanish by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. The hotline is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and can provide direct services or refer you to other organizations that can help you. It is safe for non-citizens and undocumented people to call this hotline. You can also check out these free resources online:

    General Tips for Getting ID
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Start as early as you can. You can start gathering some documents while you’re incarcerated. Start by getting your birth certificate (or naturalization certificate if you were born outside the U.S. and later became a citizen). A certified copy of your birth certificate or naturalization certificate is necessary to get all other forms of ID. See PG. 32 (birth certificate) or PG. 40 (naturalization certificate).Stick to using your legal name as it appears on your birth certificate. Even if you have used other names in the past, stick with your legal name. It is your only legal identity.Keep photocopies of all your important forms as you go.Before you pay a fee for anything, find out if you can get a “reduced fee” or a “fee waiver” based on your income. Many forms of ID require that you pay a fee before they are issued. Some fees must be paid by everyone, while other fees can be reduced or excused (“waived”) for people with limited income. We have included some information about reduced fees on PG. 53, but always check for yourself.[8]

    This chart summarizes how & why each ID is important, AND THE approximate COST of EACH type.

    SUMMARY OF KEY DOCUMENTSKEY ID DOCUMENTCOSTWHY IT’S IMPORTANTAUTHORIZED U.S. BIRTH CERTIFICATEABOUT $25, BUT VARIES BY COUNTY.This proves your age and legal presence in the United States. It is necessary in order to get most other forms of identification, including your California state ID or driver license. NATURALIZATION CERTIFICATE (IF BORN OUTSIDE OF U.S. AND BECAME A CITIZEN LATER)$345 (MAY BE FREE IF YOU SHOW FINANCIAL HARDSHIP)If you are a naturalized citizen, meaning you were born outside of the United States and became a citizen later, you will not have a U.S. birth certificate. Instead, you should use your naturalization certificate.SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER/CARDFREEYour Social Security number (SSN) is required to apply for jobs, education programs, financial aid, and government services. You need it to obtain other forms of ID, such as a state ID or driver license.CALIFORNIA STATE ID and/orDRIVER LICENSE$28 FOR A NEW CALIFORNIA STATE ID ($8 IF YOU RECEIVE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE).$33 FOR A NEW CALIFORNIA DRIVER LICENSE.IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED — FREE STATE ID MAY BE AVAILABLE THROUGH CAL-ID PROGRAM (LEARN MORE ON PG. 50).These prove your age and identity, and they may prove your legal presence in the United States. Either one can be used as an official photo ID. You will likely need one of these in order to open a bank account, to register to vote, and to apply for jobs, housing, or public benefits. State IDs and driver licenses are generally considered the most accepted form of identification.U.S. PASSPORT$135 FOR A NEW PASSPORT; $110 FOR A RENEWALThis is necessary for traveling abroad and coming back to the United States. It is also considered an official photo ID.TRIBAL ID CARDIT DEPENDS ON THE TRIBE.A tribal ID proves your enrollment in a particular Indian (Native American or Alaska Native) tribe, and can be used as official photo ID for some places (like federal buildings, airports, and banks), certain services (like the federal Indian Health Service), but not for other purposes (for example, it won’t work for notary services in California).RAP SHEETAPPROX. $50 ($25 WITH A FEE WAIVER)Your RAP sheet is a chronological listing of your entire criminal history. You want to know what shows up on your RAP sheet because employers, Public Housing Authorities, schools, government agencies, and others may use your criminal history to decide if you are eligible for their services. (Go to the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132)VOTER REGISTRATIONFREEWhen you register to vote, you will be sent a voter registration card in the mail to let you know that you’ve registered successfully. However, you do not need it to actually vote, as long as you’re registered.SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATIONFREE All male U.S. citizens, and all males living in the United States (except those present on student or visitor visas) must register for the Selective Service if they are aged 18-25. Failure to do so can result in disqualification from, or loss of, certain federal and state benefits. In California, if you do not register, you will not be eligible for state student financial aid. Selective Service used to be called “the Draft.”LIBRARY CARD(OPTIONAL)FREEA library card gives you access to free resources from your local public library, such as books, movies, and advice from librarians. It also allows you to use the library’s computers and access the Internet.
