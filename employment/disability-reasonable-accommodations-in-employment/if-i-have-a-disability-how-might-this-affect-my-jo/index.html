          <p class="text">State and federal laws provide special protections for job applicants and employees with disabilities. These laws require employers to make “reasonable accommodations” that allow someone with a disability to apply for and work in a job just like anyone else.</p>
          <p class="text">Remember, physical disabilities are not the only disabilities that are recognized. The following conditions are also considered disabilities—meaning employers are required to make “reasonable accommodations” for you if you have any of these:</p>
          <ol class="text">PAST drug addiction (NOT current drug use)<sup><a href="#footnote-1970" id="footnote-ref-1970">[1940]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Alcoholism (past or present)<sup><a href="#footnote-1971" id="footnote-ref-1971">[1941]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Mental illness</ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT:<span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>To be protected by state and federal disability laws, you must also be qualified for the job you seek.</p>
