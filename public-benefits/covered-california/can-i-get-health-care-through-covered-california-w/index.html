          <h1>Can I get health care through Covered California while I’m incarcerated?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153310"></a>Can I get health care through Covered California while I’m incarcerated?</h3>
          <p class="text">No. You cannot get health care through Covered California while you are incarcerated, but you may apply for Medi-Cal once you are nearing your release date (more information on Medi-Cal starting on PG. 538). Or if you prefer to have private health care through Covered California, you may apply once you are released (see below for more details).</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintIf you’re currently serving a sentence in jail or prison, special rules apply to you for applying for health insurance:<em><sup><a href="#footnote-1473" id="footnote-ref-1473">[1443]</a></sup></em></h4>
          <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">While you’re incarcerated:</span></p>
          <ul class="textbox">You <em>are eligible </em>to enroll in Medi-Cal while incarcerated. You may apply on your own, or through any enrollment program available at your facility.<sup><a href="#footnote-1474" id="footnote-ref-1474">[1444]</a></sup> You can’t start using a Medi-Cal health care plan while you’re incarcerated; but if you enroll before your release, you may be able to get health care more quickly once you’re out.<sup><a href="#footnote-1475" id="footnote-ref-1475">[1445]</a></sup> To learn more about Medi-Cal and how to enroll while incarcerated, go to PG. 538. You <em>are</em> <em>not eligible</em> to buy a private health care plan through Covered California, and the Individual Mandate (see PG. 532) doesn’t apply to you as long as you’re incarcerated following a criminal conviction. This means you don’t have to worry about paying a penalty, or applying for an exemption from the penalty, during your incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-1476" id="footnote-ref-1476">[1446]</a></sup></ul>
          <p class="textbox"><a id="PublicBenefits_HealthCare_After_Incarcer"></a><span class="emphasisitalic">Once you’re released:</span>You may be eligible to enroll in health care through Covered California; and the Individual Mandate (see PG. 532) may now apply to you. This means you may now be legally required to have health care, or pay a tax penalty—unless you get an exemption (read more about exemptions on PG. 532).</p>
          <ul class="textbox">If you want to enroll in Medi-Cal, and you didn’t already enroll while incarcerated, you can apply at any time after your release. For details about Medi-Cal, go to PG. 538.If you want to buy a private health care plan (and also get tax credits to help pay for it), you have 60 days after your release to notify Covered California, get approved for a Special Enrollment Period (see PG. 534), submit a Covered California application, and enroll in a health care plan. If you don’t complete this process in 60 days, you must wait for the next Open Enrollment period (see PG. 533), and you may have to pay a penalty.<sup><a href="#footnote-1477" id="footnote-ref-1477">[1447]</a></sup> </ul>
