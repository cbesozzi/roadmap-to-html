  <p>
    What is Distance Education?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Distance Education (also called Distance Learning) is an education program that uses various technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the teacher. It is a way for students to take a formal course of study (high school, vocational, or college-level) without having to travel to the classroom. Although the students and the teachers are separated, the hallmark of Distance Education is regular and substantial interaction between them.[2793] Distance Education courses usually incorporate multiple forms of media, including printed materials, CDs or DVDs, audio recordings, telephone communication, audio or video conferencing, email, and Web-casts and Internet streaming. There are two types of Distance Education interaction modes: “synchronous” and “asynchronous” instruction.[2794]

  <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/education/earning-transferring-college-credits-good-options-/distance-education/how-do-the-two-types-of-distance-education-work/">How do the two types of distance education work?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How do the two types of distance education work?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Synchronous instruction means that all of the students and the instructor(s) participate in the class at the same time, even though they are not in the same place. This is usually done through “live” teleconferencing, video conferencing web conferencing, or Internet chats. The class is given at a set time, and everyone calls or logs in at that time to participate. Synchronous courses can offer a level of interactivity similar to that of a traditional face-to-face class.[2795] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Asynchronous instruction does not require that the student(s) and the instructor(s) participate at the same time. Students choose when they want to study the course materials or interact with the instructor(s). Asynchronous instruction is more flexible than synchronous instruction, but offers less interactivity because it is not “live.” In asynchronous instruction, course materials and communications are often delivered via CDs or DVDs, by traditional mail correspondence, or through e-mails, listservs and Internet downloads.[2796]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are there benefits to distance education? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PROS:CONS:Classes and programs are available to students who cannot attend in personSaves students time because they don’t have to travel to classesOften cheaper than location-based classesOften offers more flexible scheduling Less likely to be subject to class-size restrictions (i.e. classes available to more students)Less interactivity and support than traditional classroom learningStudents must be self-motivated and self-directedMost programs require knowledge of and access to computers, Web browsers, email, and word-processing programs Some programs require continuous access to the InternetStudents miss out on benefits of classroom attendance, such as getting to know the instructor/ other students, and group discussions of views and opinions[2797]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BEWARE: Distance Education programs can vary in quality and legitimacy (quality of instruction can be low, credits/degrees may not be recognized by other schools or programs). Some programs are outright scams. (For information on how to tell if a program is a scam, see Choosing Your Educational Path, PG. 1043).

  <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/education/earning-transferring-college-credits-good-options-/distance-education/what-credentials-can-i-earn-through-distance-educa/">What credentials can I earn through distance education?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    What credentials can I earn through distance education?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thanks to the Internet, you can earn pretty much any credential through a Distance Education program that you can earn through a traditional educational program.[2798] This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor’s degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees. Distance Education programs are offered in most major CTE and college degree program areas. Program quality does vary greatly, however. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WARNING: While many accredited, reputable schools offer credential programs through Distance education, there are also plenty of scam programs that will take your money and leave you with a useless piece of paper. (For more information on spotting Distance Education scam programs, see Choosing Your Educational Path, PG. 1043.)

  <p>
    How do I find and enroll in a distance education program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ask your Correctional Counselor, or the staff of your facility’s education department for information on available programs (Note: Because of the technology requirements of Distance Education programs, they may not be available at your facility); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Request information on accredited Distance Education programs that may be available to people incarcerated in California facilities by writing to the California Department of Education, Adult Education Office, 1430 N Street, Suite 4202, Sacramento, CA 95814 or by calling (916) 322-2175.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check your local public library for information on schools that offer Distance Education programs (these programs have become very popular and are offered to some extent at most schools).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check with local community colleges to see if they offer courses through Distance Education.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit your local America’s Job Centers of California for information on Distance Education programs and the institutions that offer them.

  <p>
    ACCREDITATION OF DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are numerous commercial websites that advertise hundreds of Distance Education programs and schools in the U.S. and abroad. However, keep in mind that schools and programs pay to be listed on these websites. This means that when you search these sites, only those that have paid will come up—you will not see the rest of the schools and programs out there, so the results of your search will be limited. Also, many of these websites claim that they only list “accredited” schools and programs, however, you should always do your own research to make sure that a school or Distance Education program is 1) legitimate and 2) recognized by an approved accrediting agency.[2799] (For more information on accreditation and scam programs, see Choosing Your Educational Path, PG. 1043.)

  <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/education/earning-transferring-college-credits-good-options-/distance-education/how-much-do-distance-education-programs-cost/">How much do distance education programs cost?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How much do distance education programs cost?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The cost of Distance Education programs varies based on the type of program, the delivery media, and the institution that it is offered through. Programs offered through four-year colleges and more prestigious schools will be more expensive than those offered through local community colleges. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Two important things to note about Paying for Distance Education: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Distance Education and Fee Waivers
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Distance Education programs offered through California community colleges may qualify for an enrollment fee waiver through the California Community Colleges Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver program. (For more information on this program and how to qualify, see Paying For Your Education, PG. 1082.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Distance Education and Financial Aid
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be able to get financial aid to help you pay for your Distance Education courses. Only accredited Distance Education institutions are allowed to participate in federal financial aid programs. Even if a school or program is eligible to participate, it must choose to do so. To find out if financial aid is available for a particular school or program, check with that institution’s financial aid office (For more information on financial aid, see Paying For Your Education, PG. 1082).
  </p>
  
  <p>
     Correspondence courses
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A correspondence course is a course offered by a school or program, where the student is separated from the teacher and course materials are provided through the mail or over the Internet. There is very little interaction between the student and the teacher, communication is usually initiated by the student (whenever the student wants), and students work at their own pace. Although there are some similarities, correspondence courses are not considered a type of distance education under federal law (see the table below for key differences).[2800] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Difference Between Distance Education and Correspondence Courses
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although these two terms seem similar and are often confused, they refer to two different learning situations. Distance Education is generally an option that requires Internet access. Although Distance Education is one option to earn credit, due to the need of media/ Internet access, it may not be a possible option for an individual who is currently incarcerated.

  <p>
    What credentials can I earn through correspondence courses?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Like with Distance Education programs, you can earn pretty much any credential that you can earn through traditional schooling through a correspondence course. This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor’s degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Program quality does vary greatly, however. While many accredited schools offer credential programs through correspondence courses, this is where you are most likely to see scam programs offering bogus higher education degrees. (For more information on spotting correspondence course scams, see Choosing Your Educational Path, PG. 1043).

  <p>
    Are correspondence courses right for me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PROS:CONS:They are completely flexible and can be worked around any scheduleThey are a great way to get a head start on a CTE or college degree by earning college course credits while you are incarceratedThey can be accessed from anywhere, Internet access is not necessary, so they allow you to be less dependent on what your facility offersYou must be entirely self-motivated and self-directed, or you may find it difficult to keep up your momentum and finish the program You miss out on the benefits of regular interaction with instructors and other studentsThere is limited support if you are having trouble with a course
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I find and enroll in a correspondence program? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:[2801]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are interested in taking a correspondence course while you are incarcerated, your facility’s education department should be able to provide information and guidance. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Two great resources for researching correspondence programs from inside are: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Prisoners’ Guerrilla Handbook to Correspondence Programs in the United States and Canada by Jon Marc Taylor. This is a comprehensive guide to correspondence courses available to incarcerated people, providing detailed program overviews and contact information. At the time of this publication, the handbook is in its 3rd edition, published in 2009 (ISBN: 978-0981938509). Check your facility’s library or education department. It is also available from http://www.amazon.com and Barnes & Noble (both are CDCR approved vendors). You can also write to the publisher for information on ordering the book: Biddle Publishing Company and Audenreed Press, P.B.M. 103, Box 1305, Brunswick, ME 04011.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Prison Education Guide by Christopher Zoukis and edited by Susan Schwartzkopf (through Prison Legal News Publishing). This is a comprehensive guide to correspondence programs for prisoners that It includes a detailed analysis of the quality, cost, and course offerings of all college correspondence programs available to prisoners. The publication costs $49.95, and will be available beginning March 1, 2016 (taking pre-orders now online at https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/products/prison-education-guide/). It is also available from http://www.amazon.com (a CDCR-approved vendor). You can also write to the publisher for information on ordering the book: Prison Legal news Publishing, P.O. Box 1151, 1013 Lucerne Ave., Lake Worth, FL 33460.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, see Appendix D, PG. 1104 for a list of schools that have a history of successfully offering correspondence courses to incarcerated individuals (working within correctional facility restrictions).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Student Responsibilities for Correspondence Courses
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you enroll in a correspondence course while you are incarcerated, you will be responsible for getting all of the required textbooks and materials yourself. You may also be responsible for finding a “proctor” at your institution to administer any midterm or final exams. A proctor is someone who watches over you while you take your exam to make sure that you are the one actually taking the exam, and that you do not cheat. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See Appendix D, PG. 1104 for a list of schools known to offer correspondence courses;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check your local public library for information on schools that offer correspondence courses;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit your local America’s Job Centers of California and ask about correspondence programs. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Once you have returned to the community, you will have access to more resources, including the Internet, than when you were incarcerated. We recommend that you take advantage of interactive Distance Education programs or traditional face-to-face programs, as these tend to offer a richer and more integrated educational experience than correspondence courses. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
     
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Paying for Correspondence Course
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may be eligible to receive financial aid to pay for your correspondence study, but it depends on the school you are taking courses through. Because of federal regulations, schools that offer primarily correspondence courses are not eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs. If more than 50% of the courses the institution offers are correspondence courses, or more than 50% of the students enrolled are taking correspondence courses, then the school is not eligible for federal financial aid. Additionally, a school is not eligible if more than 25% of its students are incarcerated.[2802] (For more information on financial aid, see Paying For Your Education, PG. 1082.)
