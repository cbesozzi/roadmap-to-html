          <h1>If I am eligible, when could I apply for a pardon?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153957"></a>If I am eligible, when could I apply for a pardon?</h3>
          <p class="text">When you can/ should apply for a pardon depends on the type of pardon you are seeking.</p>
          <h5 class="numberboldblack">Pardon with Certificate of Rehabilitation</h5>
          <p class="text">Since a Certificate of Rehabilitation acts as an <em>automatic</em> application for a pardon, <em>as soon as </em>you are granted your COR, it will be forwarded straight to the Governor as a pardon request —and you don’t need to do anything else! If you do NOT have a Certificate of Rehabilitation yet, but your conviction is eligible for one, you can apply for a COR as soon as you’ve completed your period of rehabilitation. (For more information on getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation, see PG. 1184.) </p>
          <h5 class="numberboldblack">Traditional or Direct Pardon (without Certificate of Rehabilitation)</h5>
          <p class="text">You can apply for a pardon directly from the Governor after you have been off probation or parole for 10 years, with NO criminal activity during that period.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3133" id="footnote-ref-3133">[3097]</a></sup></sup> The 10 year requirement will only be waived (excused) in <em>very</em> rare situations (under “extraordinary and compelling circumstances”). </p>
          <h5 class="numberboldblack">BPH-Recommended Pardon</h5>
          <p class="text">The BPH can only recommend you for a pardon <em>while you are still incarcerated</em>. There is no specific time frame for when the BPH can recommend you for a pardon, but it would likely be <em>after</em> the BPH has a chance to consider information about your case (for example, after you’ve had at least one BPH hearing).</p>
          <ol class="text">If (or when) you have a BPH hearing, you can bring any evidence showing why you deserve to receive a pardon, based on your good conduct, accomplishments, the circumstances of your conviction, or your sentence. </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you are no longer in prison, you are not eligible for a BPH recommendation for a pardon. </ol>
