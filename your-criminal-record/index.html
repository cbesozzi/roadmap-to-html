                <p class="description">In the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, you will first learn the importance of understanding your records—where that information exists in the world, and how to fix mistakes in your record early on in reentry. In the second part of the Chapter, you will learn that you may be able to “clean up” your criminal record through different kinds of “expungement” in California. Expungement helps to protect your criminal history information and keep it out of sight for certain people. In most cases, “cleaning up” your criminal record WON’T completely erase it, but it CAN make past convictions and other criminal history less visible to many, which has many benefits in different areas of your life, including applying to housing, jobs, and more.</p>
                <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

                <h2><a id="Expung_Introduction"></a><a id="_Toc448153865"></a>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
                <p class="text">This UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER is broken up into the following subjects:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Key Concepts For Understanding Your Criminal Record &amp; Fixing Errors</strong> (PG. 1035), which explains the different types of criminal records that you may have, what information can (and can’t) be included in your criminal records and on background checks, and why it’s important to review and understand your own criminal records.<strong>Who Can See Your Criminal Record</strong> (PG. 1046), which gives you the different rules for who CAN and CAN’T see your criminal records and/or run a background check on you (like employers, law enforcement agencies, licensing agencies, and landlords), and how they can use the information they get about you.<strong>How to Get Your Criminal Records</strong> (PG. 1048), which tells you how to get copies of the different types of criminal records you may have. You will need these in order to decide the best way to clean up your record.<strong>How to Clean Up Your Record</strong> (PG. 1051), which explains the different options, or “remedies,” available for cleaning up your record. It helps you figure out whether you and your offense are eligible for them, and walks you through how to do each one.</ol>
                <p class="text"><em>If you are recently released from prison or jail, or earlier in the reentry journey,</em> the sections about key concepts in understanding you record and fixing errors, learning who can and cannot see your criminal record information, and how you can get copies are the most important early on.<em>If you are later in your reentry journey, cleaning up your record will become more important to you over time</em>, as many of these “expungement” options are only available to people off supervision or those who are able under law to ask to get off supervision early. </p>
                <h2><a id="Expung_KeyConceptsUnderstandingCrimRec"></a><a id="_Toc448153866"></a>Key Concepts for Understanding your Criminal Record &amp; Fixing Errors—Early in Reentry </h2>
                <p class="text">This is one of the most important sections for people early in their reentry journey—to better understand your criminal record, learn how to fix errors, and be prepared for what others can and cannot find out about you and your record.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153867"></a>What is a criminal record? </h3>
                <p class="text">Your “criminal record” is the broad term we use to include ALL of the information created about any contact you’ve had with law enforcement, the courts, or another part of the criminal justice system. Your “criminal record” includes arrests, charges filed against you, convictions, pleas, acquittals, dismissals, sentences, and any other contact you have had with law enforcement and/or the criminal justice system that was <em>documented</em> (written down). Here are some <em>examples</em> of how your contact with law enforcement or the criminal justice system can get documented. All of this information is considered part of your criminal record (but note that much of it may be PROTECTED from being seen): </p>
                <ol class="text">You were pulled over while driving and arrested for a DUI; You received a citation for public disorderliness or having an open container in public; You were arrested, and the police wrote up an arrest record;You were taken to jail, booked into the system, and fingerprinted;You were charged with a crime;You were arraigned (appeared before a judge) in court and pleaded guilty or not guilty;You were convicted of a crime and sentenced to prison or jail, and the judge wrote a sentencing order;You were acquitted of the charges after a trial;You agreed to a plea bargain with the prosecutor. In exchange, the prosecutor dismissed some of the charges against you;You violated your probation or parole and had your supervision revoked;You had your conviction dismissed or expunged</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS TO KNOW ABOUT: A lot of this information CANNOT be included in a regular background check. For more information about what information can and can’t be included in your background check, see PG. 1042.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153868"></a>Why is it important to understand my criminal record?</h3>
                <p class="text">It’s important to know what will show up in your criminal records so that you can make sure it’s accurate, that information that shouldn’t be disclosed stays protected, and so that you can better prepare to deal with your record coming up when you’re trying to get a job, find housing, reunite with your family, apply for public benefits, or go back to school. Furthermore, California has laws that allow you to “clean up “some of your record LATER in the reentry process.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153869"></a>Types of Criminal Records</h1>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153870"></a>RAP Sheets</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153871"></a>What is a RAP sheet and why is it important?</h3>
                <p class="text">A RAP sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) is the government’s official version of your criminal history, as recorded by local, state, and federal government agencies (such as courts, law enforcement, FBI, and other criminal justice agencies). It contains a list of every contact you have had with the criminal justice system, including: arrests, charges, convictions, acquittals, dismissals, pleas, sentences, and open warrants. Your RAP sheet includes important information like the date of each arrest, which law enforcement agency arrested you, what offense(s) you were charged with, your case number (docket or indictment number), and—most important—the final outcome (disposition) of each case (for example, acquittal, conviction, plea bargain, sentence, or dismissal).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2802" id="footnote-ref-2802">[2802]</a></sup></sup> It’s also important to look out for errors (learn about common errors in RAP sheets on PG. 1038).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153872"></a>How many RAP sheets do I have?</h3>
                <p class="text">If you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime in California, you potentially have three different RAP sheets.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2803" id="footnote-ref-2803">[2803]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">Your county (local) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in that specific county <em>only</em>. If you have convictions in multiple counties, you will have a RAP sheet for each county.Your DOJ (state) RAP sheet lists your criminal history in all of California, but <em>only California</em>. This RAP sheet is kept by the California Department of Justice (DOJ).<sup><a href="#footnote-2804" id="footnote-ref-2804">[2804]</a></sup> Unless you are 100% positive that <em>all</em> of your arrests and convictions were in just one county, it’s a safer bet to get a copy of your DOJ (state) RAP sheet to make sure you know of everything about you in California.Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet lists any and all criminal justice involvement you’ve had in <em>any</em> state in the U.S., or with the federal government. This RAP sheet is produced by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI).<sup><a href="#footnote-2805" id="footnote-ref-2805">[2805]</a></sup> Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet is also called an <em>Identity History Summary</em>.</ol>
                <p class="text">See APPENDIX AA, on PG. 1159 for a sample RAP sheet.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Your RAP sheet is confidential! <em>Unlike a background check</em>, your official government RAP sheets are <em>confidential</em>. This means that <em>most people</em>—<em>most</em> employers, private landlords, and average Joes—CANNOT see your RAP sheets. Only <em>certain people</em> under <em>certain circumstances</em> can see your RAP sheet—this includes <em>courts</em>, <em>law enforcement</em>, <em>government agencies</em>, and <em>special employers</em>.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2806" id="footnote-ref-2806">[2806]</a></sup></sup></strong> Of course, <em>YOU</em> always have a right to see your own RAP sheet. (For a complete list of who can see your RAP sheet, see PG. 1046.) BUT: Even though <em>RAP sheets</em> are confidential, <em>some of the information</em> in them will likely show up in background checks. That’s why it’s important to know what information is in your RAP sheet, and to correct any errors. For more information about correcting mistakes in your RAP sheet, see PG. 1044. For more information on background checks and what information can and can’t show up in them, see PG. 1040.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153873"></a>Why is it helpful for me to see my RAP sheet?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are 4 main reasons why it’s important to see your RAP sheet and know exactly what it says:</p>
                <ol class="text"><em>RAP sheets often contain mistakes</em>, such as incomplete or incorrect information. It’s important to <em>find and correct any errors </em>BEFORE the wrong information has a chance to harm you. <em>You will have an accurate record of your criminal history</em>, so that you know what information certain employers, professional licensing agencies, landlords, banks, or others might see about you. To learn more about what information employers and licensing agencies CAN and CAN’T consider, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 595. To learn more about what information private landlords, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and owners of government-assisted housing CAN and CANNOT consider, see the HOUSING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 351.<em>You will be better prepared to answer questions about your criminal history</em>. If you know what is in your record, you can plan ahead and figure out how to talk about it in a more positive light.

                <h4 class="sidebox">What will my RAP sheet look like?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Looking at a RAP sheet can be confusing! RAP sheets have lots of numbers and abbreviations, so it’s not always clear what information it actually contains or if it is correct. To learn how to read and understand the information in your California RAP sheet, and to see a sample California RAP sheet, see APPENDIX AA, on PG. 1159. You can also ask a lawyer or a public defender to help you read and understand your RAP sheet.</p>
                <p class="text">There are many different reasons why incorrect or incomplete information may show up in your government-produced RAP sheet. It’s very important to get copies of your RAP sheet (and background check, discussed on PG. 1044)—so that you can find and correct any errors BEFORE they cause problems for you!</p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_FixingErrors_commonRAPsheeterrors"></a><a id="_Toc448153875"></a>What are common errors in RAP Sheets?</h3>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Someone else’s information</strong>. Your RAP sheet may contain criminal history information about someone else with the same (or a similar) name as you.<strong>Leaving out important information about a case</strong>. Your RAP sheet may leave out important information about the final outcome of your case. For example, your RAP sheet may still say “case pending” even AFTER you were acquitted or the charges were dropped.<strong>Including sealed information</strong>. Your RAP may contain records that should have been destroyed or can only be released by special court order, such as sealed arrests or juvenile offenses.<strong>Misleading information</strong>. It is possible that a single charge may appear multiple times on your RAP, making it look like you have multiple offenses when you only have one.<strong>Misclassifying your offense</strong>. If a misdemeanor conviction shows up as a felony on your RAP sheet, this is a serious problem!</ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">HOw could these mistakes end up in my rap sheet?</h4>
                <ul class="textbox"><em>Human error.</em> The people who manage the various records can make mistakes. They may confuse you with someone who has a similar name, enter your information wrong, or include information that should NOT be included (for example, a sealed juvenile offense). <em>Failure to confirm information</em>: Although government agencies are supposed to confirm that the information that they have about you is correct and up-to-date, a lot of times they don’t. As a result, they may not report changes in the status of your case or the final outcome of the case, <em>even if you were acquitted or the case was dismissed!Identity theft.</em> Someone else may open an account using your personal information or commit a crime and pretend to be you by giving your name or identification. These activities may then go in your record as your actions! </ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153876"></a>When can I fix the errors?</h3>
                <p class="text">You can start to fix the errors right away! If you find incorrect or missing information in your criminal records, you can follow these steps to fix the errors! Don’t let errors stay on your record — they can hurt your chances of getting a job, a place to live, or government benefits, and they can disrupt many other areas of your life as well! And don’t wait until the errors show up on a background check that is seen by an employer, private landlord, creditor, or government agency—it’s much easier to clean up errors BEFORE they cause you any problems! Make sure your criminal record contains only <em>correct</em> and <em>up-to-date</em> information, so that wrong information does NOT get used against you.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153877"></a>How can I fix errors in my California State (DOJ) RAP sheet?</h3>
                <p class="text">Even though your DOJ RAP sheet is supposed to be the official record of your criminal history from California law enforcement agencies and the courts, it is likely to still contain errors. If you think that <span class="emphasisitalic">any</span> piece of information contained in your state RAP sheet is incorrect, you must submit a formal challenge to the Department of Justice in order to dispute the information. However, you can only submit this formal challenge <span class="emphasisitalic">after</span> you have requested and received a copy of your RAP sheet from the DOJ.<sup><a href="#footnote-2807" id="footnote-ref-2807">[2807]</a></sup> Once the DOJ receives your challenge, it will review your claim and decide whether or not to correct the information in your RAP sheet. </p>

                <h4 class="sidebox">What are “FEDERAL agencies and courts”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If you had a case in FEDERAL court, or if you’ve had any interaction with FEDERAL law enforcement, it will show up on your FBI RAP sheet. You will need to contact the federal agency that sent your information to the FBI in order to correct it.Examples of FEDERAL agencies and courts include: the FBI; the U.S. Attorney’s Office (federal prosecutor); U.S. district courts; and U.S. Offices of Probation and Pretrial Services (federal probation department). </p>
                <p class="text">Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your Identity History Summary) is the federal government’s official record of all of your interactions with law enforcement and the criminal justice system from anywhere in the United States, including any federal cases or convictions. The FBI gets your fingerprints and criminal history information from other criminal justice organizations throughout the U.S. This includes local police, county sheriff, and state highway patrol departments, statewide criminal justice agencies (such as the California Department of Justice), federal law enforcement agencies (such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI itself), and state and federal courts. In general, when you have any interaction with one of these agencies, they send your information to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division. The FBI can only change your information if the original agency or court (i.e., the one that sent the information to the FBI in the first place) tells the FBI to change it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2809" id="footnote-ref-2809">[2809]</a></sup> If you think your FBI RAP sheet is inaccurate or incomplete, there are 2 ways to correct the information: </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11"><strong>OPTION 1: Contact the court or agency that sent your information to the FBI.</strong></div>
                <p class="text">NOTE: Each entry on your FBI RAP sheet should list the specific agency that provided the information. This is how you can tell which agency sent the FBI the incorrect or incomplete information on your FBI RAP sheet.</p>
                <h4> &gt; If the incorrect or missing information is from a CALIFORNIA state agency or court:</h4>
                <p class="text">Contact the California DOJ’s Bureau of Criminal Information and Analysis, and ask them to send the FBI corrected or updated information<span class="hyperlink7"><strong>.</strong></span><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2810" id="footnote-ref-2810">[2810]</a></sup></sup><span class="hyperlink7"><strong> </strong></span></p>

                <p class="answer">Contact the state Identification Bureau of the state where the agency or court is located, and ask them to send the FBI corrected or updated information. Contact information for the Identification Bureau of every U.S. state is available on the FBI’s website at: <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/state-identification-bureau-listing">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/state-identification-bureau-listing</a>.</p>

                <p class="answer">Contact the specific federal agency that sent your information to the FBI, and ask them to send corrected or updated information. See APPENDIX G, PG. 1114 for additional details about each of these steps.</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11"><strong>OPTION 2: Go through the FBI directly.<sup><a href="#footnote-2811" id="footnote-ref-2811">[2811]</a></sup></strong></div>
                <p class="text">If you don’t know where the incomplete or incorrect information on your RAP sheet came from, you can contact the FBI directly to challenge it, and ask them to correct it. You will need to write a “challenge letter” explaining exactly what information is wrong and why, and send it to the FBI along with any proof you have to support your claim. (For a list of common RAP sheet errors, see PG. 1038.)The FBI will then investigate your claim. If the FBI decides that the information in your RAP sheet was wrong or incomplete, it will correct your RAP sheet and let you know. For a detailed explanation of both Option 1 and Option 2, see APPENDIX G, PG. 1114.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: IT IS <em>EXTREMELY</em> IMPORTANT TO REVIEW YOUR RAP SHEETS — both State and Federal-level — to make sure that all the information contained in them is ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AND UP-TO-DATE. Any errors on your RAP sheet can cause you serious problems in the future when you apply for a job, a professional license, housing, or a loan, or if you try to reconnect with your family, or if you get arrested or charged with a crime in the future. (To find out how to get a copy of your RAP sheet, see PG. 1048. For more information on what to do if there are errors in your RAP sheet, see PG. 1038.) </p>

                <h2 class="subheading2">Background Checks</h2>
                <h4 class="sidebox">REMINDER </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">A <em>background check</em> is the process of looking up information about your past—such as your criminal history, work experience, education, debts, and other personal facts. They are usually done by <em>private background check companies</em> which often get requests for them from employers and landlords. There are special laws that protect your rights when someone gets a background check on you. <em>Remember</em>, a background check does NOT include your RAP sheet or your credit report, and there are strict limits on what criminal history information they can include.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153880"></a>What is a background check? </h3>
                <p class="text">You’ve probably heard of someone running a “background check” on someone else. A background check is the process of looking up non-confidential information about someone’s past activities, including their criminal history, work experience, education, debts, etc. When someone runs a background check on you, they may research your history by looking up public records about you, running an internet search on you, and even interviewing people you know! Most commonly, background checks are done by <em>private companies</em> that specialize in investigating people and compiling information about them. Employers, private landlords, creditors, and other people often hire these companies to run a background check on you when you apply for a job, rent an apartment, apply for a loan, or volunteer at your child’s school! (For more information about background checks in these different situations, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER (PG. 595), HOUSING CHAPTER (PG. 351), and FAMILY &amp; CHILDREN CHAPTER (PG. 784).</p>
                <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER: Your RAP sheet itself is confidential and CANNOT be included in most background checks. BUT some of the information in your RAP sheet—like the record of certain criminal convictions—may be public information, so the information can show up on a regular background check. For example, court records are public information, so a background check company can go to the courthouse and look up your records to find out about convictions.</p>
                <h4 class="textbox">DEFINITIONS: <br/>Background Check Reports &amp; Background Check Companies</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">A “background check report” is the document that an employer, landlord, or other person sees when he/she hires a private background check company to run a background check on you.A “background check company” is a private company that specialize in doing background checks (and selling the information they gather).</ul>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_InfoCANNOTbackgroundcheck"></a><a id="_Toc448153881"></a>What information cannot show up in a private background check?</h3>
                <p class="text">Background check laws protect you by making it illegal for <em>private</em> <em>background check companies</em> to include certain types of information in your background check report, and by creating penalties if they do. </p>
                <h4><em>Information that </em>CANNOT<em> be in your background check report in California:</em></h4>

                <p class="text">Background check companies must follow specific rules when they include ANY negative or harmful information—<em>including criminal history information</em>—in a background check on you. Harmful information includes anything that could hurt your chances of getting a job, housing, insurance, or public benefits; cause you to have to pay more for housing, insurance, or public benefits; have ANY other negative impact on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2819" id="footnote-ref-2819">[2819]</a></sup><em>* Confirming that public records are accurate:</em>Background check companies <em>cannot </em>include any public information (for example, information about arrests, convictions, civil actions, tax liens, and outstanding judgments) unless the company has been double-checked it for accuracy in the past 30 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-2820" id="footnote-ref-2820">[2820]</a></sup> This means the company should check with the court, police, or other agency to find out the <em>current status</em> of any arrests, charges, indictments, convictions, judgments, etc. For example, if you were arrested but never charged, if your charges were dismissed or reduced, if you were acquitted (or convicted), or if there were any other changes to your case, the company must report the <em>updated</em> information.<sup><a href="#footnote-2821" id="footnote-ref-2821">[2821]</a></sup><em>** Confirming “testimonial information” when possible: </em></p>
                <ol class="text">A background check company CANNOT include negative information from personal interviews with people who know you—such as neighbors, landlords, employers, etc.—in your background check UNLESS the agency either confirms the information with another person (who would know whether the information is true or not) OR the person who gave negative information in the first place is the best (or only) possible source.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2822" id="footnote-ref-2822">[2822]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <p class="text">In the age of the Internet, there is a lot of information that could show up in your background check report. For example, it may contain information about:</p>
                <ol class="text">Criminal convictions;Other court cases you were involved in (for example, lawsuits, small claims court cases, money judgments against you, etc.)Your driving record;Previous employment;Education records;Property ownership records;Bankruptcies and tax liens;Professional licensing records;Previous addresses; Past evictions; AND Personal references from people who know you (such as past employers, private landlords, neighbors, etc.).</ol>
                <p class="text">Although anyone can look up public records or information on the Internet about you, there are special laws that limit WHO &amp; WHEN someone can run a background check on you if they use a private (“commercial”) background check company. In general, the people who can run a private background check on you include: employers, private landlords, insurance companies, professional licensing agencies, creditors, anyone with a court order or subpoena, and anyone seeking child support payments from you. (For a list of who can legally run a background check on you, see PG. 1046.) In addition, there are laws that protect you by <em>limiting</em> the information that can show up in a private background check report, and give you the chance to <em>correct</em> any errors that show up. For a list of what information CAN &amp; CANNOT be included in your private background check, see PG.<strong> </strong>1041-1042.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153883"></a>Why is it helpful for me to see what’s in my background check?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are several reasons why it’s important to find out what’s likely to come up in your background check:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Background checks often contain mistakes—</strong>such as incomplete, incorrect, or forbidden information. It’s important to <em>find and correct any errors</em> BEFORE the information shows up in a background check and causes you problems.<strong>You will know what other people are likely to see about you</strong>, in case your criminal history comes up on an application for employment, professional licensing, housing, or a loan, or in any other situation. To learn more about what information employers and licensing agencies CAN and CAN’T consider, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER (PG. 595). For more information about what landlords and housing authorities can consider, see the HOUSING CHAPTER (PG. 351).<strong>You will be better prepared to answer questions about your criminal history during job interviews, on job and housing applications, and in other situations.</strong> For more information about what employers CAN and CAN’T <em>ask</em> you about or <em>see</em> in your record, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, (PG. 595).<strong>You can protect your rights and maximize your chances of success!</strong> Remember, there are laws that protect your rights when someone runs a background check on you. But you need to know what information will show up in your background check in order to protect those rights! </ol>
                <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, cleaning up your criminal record will reduce the information that most people can see about you when they run a background check! </p>

However, in practice, it might not be as easy or straightforward, especially if the background check company is uncooperative or unresponsive. If you have trouble getting the company to review or change the wrong information in your file, it is recommended that you contact a lawyer for help. </p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153890"></a>Credit Reports</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153891"></a>What is a credit report? And what’s the difference between a RAP sheet and a credit report?</h3>
                <p class="text">In California, a credit report is different from a background check and is covered by a different set of laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-2828" id="footnote-ref-2828">[2828]</a></sup> A credit report contains information about your money and finances—including debts you owe (such as unpaid bills, loans, or leases), your payment history for past bills and debts, and the status of your credit accounts. Your credit report does NOT include your criminal history or other personal information about you. For this reason, this legal guide does not go into detail about the laws governing credit reports.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153892"></a>Will my credit report be included in my background check?</h3>
                <p class="text">Generally, no. Background check companies are NOT allowed to include your credit report in your regular background check, because not everyone who is allowed to see your background check is also allowed to see your credit report. When companies run your credit report, they must follow a separate set of rules that are specific to credit reports, which are not covered in this guide. The only time that your credit report and background check will be together is when someone who is <em>ALLOWED to see both</em> requests them together (for example, a landlord can request both at the same time, but most employers cannot see your <em>credit</em> report, just your criminal background check).<sup><a href="#footnote-2829" id="footnote-ref-2829">[2829]</a></sup> <em>NOTE: This </em>Roadmap to Reentry<em> guide does NOT cover credit reports. </em>When this guide refers to background checks or background check reports, it means information about your <em>criminal history</em> (and certain other personal information)—but NOT your credit report.

                <ul class="learn-bullets">Who CAN and CAN’T see your RAP sheet;Who CAN and CAN’T run a background check on you;Other ways that people may see your criminal history.</ul>
                <p class="text">There are laws about who can and can’t get your RAP sheet or run a background check on you. This section will explain the different rules for accessing each type of criminal record.</p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_WhoCanSeeRapSheet"></a><a id="_Toc448153894"></a>Who is legally allowed to see my RAP sheet?</h3>
                <p class="text">MOST PEOPLE CANNOT SEE YOUR RAP SHEET. Your RAP sheet is protected and confidential because it is kept by law enforcement agencies. The only people who can see your RAP sheet are: </p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Criminal justice and law enforcement</span> agencies have full access to your RAP sheet, including juvenile adjudications, expunged/dismissed cases, and sometimes even sealed records!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2830" id="footnote-ref-2830">[2830]</a></sup></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">State occupational licensing agencies</span> can review your RAP when considering whether or not to issue you a professional license. Some may ban you from getting a license if you have a criminal record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2831" id="footnote-ref-2831">[2831]</a></sup></sup> (For more information see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 654)<span class="emphasisitalic">State and local welfare agencies</span> including child welfare agencies, child support agencies, and humane societies can see your RAP sheet.<sup><a href="#footnote-2832" id="footnote-ref-2832">[2832]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Most public employers</span> can see your RAP sheet when you apply for a job with them. These include all federal, state and local government agencies—including police and fire departments, the California Department of Corrections (CDCR), local Boards of Education, and the U.S. Postal Service.<sup><a href="#footnote-2833" id="footnote-ref-2833">[2833]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">Certain private employers</span> can see your RAP sheet if you are applying for a job that involves access to sensitive information (e.g., nuclear power plants, public utilities, private security companies, and financial institutions like banks) OR you will be working with children, elderly, disabled, or other vulnerable people.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2834" id="footnote-ref-2834">[2834]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_WhoCanRunBackgroundCheck"></a><a id="_Toc448153895"></a>Who is legally allowed to run a background check on me?</h3>
                <p class="text">Unlike a RAP sheet, many more people (for housing, employments, bank loans, public benefits, etc.) can run a private background check on you, but it is still protected from showing everything in most cases. In California, state and federal laws<sup><a href="#footnote-2835" id="footnote-ref-2835">[2835]</a></sup> allow background check companies to run background checks and send the information…</p>
                <ol class="text">To anyone making decisions about you for: employment, renting a house/apartment, professional licensing, government benefits, credit obligations,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2836" id="footnote-ref-2836">[2836]</a></sup></sup> court-ordered child support or alimony, or insurance;To establish child support requirements; In response to a court order or subpoena;To anyone with a legitimate business need for the report (for example, a bank, creditor, or someone you have a business relationship with);<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2837" id="footnote-ref-2837">[2837]</a></sup></sup>orTo the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration.</ol>
                <p class="text">Basically, the main people who can—and are likely to—run a background check on you are employers, private landlords, insurance companies, licensing boards and agencies, and financial institutions. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, there are LIMITS on what information can be included in your background check. In general, <em>cleaning up your record</em> means that the information may no longer show up in the background checks that <em>most</em> people—like ordinary employers and private landlords—can get.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153896"></a>Is there any other way that someone can see my criminal history?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. Because most criminal records and criminal case information is technically public, people in the general public could access on their own most legal paperwork filed in court or with a government agency. For example, anyone can go to the local courthouse, look up your criminal case and make copies of the documents in the court file. But it is very unlikely that most people would go down to the courthouse to look you up for an apartment or job! Keep in mind that the information is likely scattered across hundreds of locations, so someone would really have to know exactly what they are looking for to actually find it. That’s why most people use professional background check companies to do the investigating for them—and that’s why these companies and the background checks they create are regulated by state and federal laws to protect you! </p>

                <p class="text">If you have ever been arrested or had a conviction in another state, or for a federal offense, you will want to get a copy of your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your “Identity History Summary.” There are two ways to get a copy of your FBI RAP sheet:</p>
                <ol class="text">You can request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI; ORYou can use a special private company, called a “Channeler,” that has contracted with the FBI to perform this service.</ol>
                <p class="text">NOTE: It is generally faster to go through an FBI Channeler, but it is likely to be more expensive because these companies usually charge extra fees.Whether you request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI or go through a channeler, you will need to fill out the FBI’s “Applicant Information Form” and get fingerprinted by a Live Scan service provider.

                <p class="text">The process for getting your local RAP sheet is different in each county. In some counties, you can get a complete RAP sheet that has ALL of your criminal history information from that county in one place, including all of your convictions, arrests, and any open warrants. In other counties, these records are kept separately (by different agencies), so you will need to go to several places and get separate records for all of your court cases (convictions), arrest records, and warrants. You will need to contact the police department, sheriff’s department, courthouse, or Public Defender’s Office of the county where you were convicted for information on how to get your local RAP sheet. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">Remember, your county RAP sheet and other records will ONLY show information for <em>that county</em>. If you’ve had any interaction with the police, courts, highway patrol, or any other law enforcement or criminal justice agencies in other counties, you should get your California (DOJ) RAP sheet to see all of your criminal history information.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153901"></a>How do I get a copy of my background check?</h3>
                <p class="text">The best way to find out what information might show up in your background check is to get your own background check done <em>on yourself</em>. There are 2 ways to do this:</p>
                <p class="normal1"><strong>OPTION 1</strong>: <strong>Pay a <em>reputable</em> background check company to run a report on you.</strong></p>
                <p class="text">There are MANY private background check companies out there—you can search online for “background checks” or check your local Yellow Pages under “Investigators.” Beware, however, some background check companies are scams. Look up or call a few different companies to see what they offer and how much they charge. Avoid companies that seem to charge much more or much less than others.</p>
                <p class="normal1"><strong>OPTION 2: Request a background check report.</strong></p>
                <p class="text">Under federal and state law, you are entitled to get a FREE copy of your background check once every 12 months from any background check company.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2839" id="footnote-ref-2839">[2839]</a></sup></sup> To get a copy of your background check for free, you must confirm <em>in writing</em> that <em>1 of the following </em>is true: </p>
                <ol class="text">You are unemployed and intend to look for work within the next 60 days; You receive public benefits (government assistance such as CalFresh or General Assistance); ORYou believe there may be errors in your report because you have been the victim of fraud or identity theft.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2840" id="footnote-ref-2840">[2840]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Send a letter to whichever background check company you choose stating that you fall into one of the above categories (and list which category), and that you would like to request your free background check. Legitimate agencies should not hesitate when you ask for your free report and should offer to run it right away. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, your background check is different from your credit report, but you are entitled to both for free once every 12 months. </p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153903"></a>Why could it be helpful to “clean up” my criminal record?</h3>
                <p class="text">In general, <em>cleaning up your criminal record</em> can reduce many of the damaging effects associated with having a criminal history: </p>
                <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record can hide criminal records from certain people who run background checks on you—meaning most private employers, private landlords, and other private individuals or companies will NOT be able to see much of the information in your record.Cleaning up your record may allow you to say that you were never convicted of a particular offense; and/or may restore many of the rights that you lost because of a conviction (for example, voting rights, right to sit on a jury service, gun rights, etc.)Cleaning up your record can reduce or remove the legal restrictions that prevent you from getting certain jobs and professional licenses.</ol>
                <p class="text">Cleaning up your record will make it easier to rebuild your life, move forward, and maximize your opportunities for success in the future. The first step toward cleaning up your criminal record is understanding the different types of records you may have and the information that may be in them.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153904"></a>If I am required to register with local law enforcement because of a sex, arson, or drug conviction, how will cleaning up my record affect my registration requirement?</h3>
                <p class="text">Like most other questions about cleaning your record, this will depend on the specific details of your situation, including the type of registration requirement you have, your conviction offense, and which of these “remedies” you use to clean up your record. Certain remedies can remove your registration requirement, while others will NOT affect your registration requirement at all, so you will still have to register. For more information about which “cleaning remedies” DO and DON’T affect your registration requirements, see PG. 1096.</p>
                <h4>California offers these remedies to help you clean up your record…</h4>
                <ol class="text">You can correct errors, fill in incomplete information, or add missing information in your record (see PG. 1038 to learn about fixing errors in your RAP sheet, and see PG. 1043 to learn about fixing errors in a background check);You may be able to get your conviction(s) expunged (see PG. 1055);You may be able to get your felony conviction reduced (see PG. 1068), or reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor (see PG. 1072);You may be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (see PG. 1078);You may be able to get a pardon from the governor (see PG. 1082);You may be able to get your adult arrest record(s) sealed (see PG. 1088) or get your juvenile criminal records sealed (see PG. 1090);You may be able to get your federal conviction expunged (see PG. 1092) or get a Presidential Pardon (see PG. 1094).</ol>

When you ask to have your record cleaned up (usually by filing papers in court or with the government), you will want to make sure that the judge (or Governor) has <em>all possible materials that support your request</em>, such as letters of support, school transcripts, awards, certificates of achievement, and diplomas. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153905"></a>What information will I need to clean up my record?</h3>
                <p class="text">This is a <em>general</em> list of the information you will need to <em>have </em>for EVERY entry in your criminal record:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2841" id="footnote-ref-2841">[2841]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">Your case number (sometimes called “docket number”);The dates associated with your offense, including the dates of arrest, conviction, sentencing, release, and completion of any term of supervision;The name of the code (for example, Penal Code, Health &amp; Safety Code, etc.) and section number of the code that you were accused or convicted of violating;Whether you were ordered to serve time on probation (formal and informal probation are treated the same in your record);If so, for how long?Whether you were ordered to pay any restitution, court fines or penalties, or administrative fees, and how much (learn more about these in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717); andWhether you were sentenced to state prison.</ol>

                <ol class="text">The information in your record will help you (and your lawyer, if you have one) <em>decide which remedies you are eligible for</em> (allowed to get), based on your criminal history (such as expungement, reclassification, dismissal, Certificate of Rehabilitation, or pardon); ANDTo request the remedy you want, you (or your lawyer) will need to <em>fill out forms for the court or agency</em>. You will need <em>detailed information </em>from your criminal record in order to fill out these forms.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2842" id="footnote-ref-2842">[2842]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153907"></a>Where do I get this information for expungement?</h3>
                <p class="text">The best way to get this information is from your RAP sheet. You will need the RAP sheet that has information on ALL of your convictions.<em>Choose the RAP sheet that has information on ALL of your cases:</em></p>
                <ol class="text">Your local (county) RAP sheet will list only your cases <em>in that county</em>, so only use this if ALL of your cases are from the SAME COUNTY (or if you only have 1 case). For information on getting your local county RAP sheet, see PG. 1049.Your California (DOJ) RAP sheet will list all of your cases in <em>California</em>, so use this if ALL of your cases are from the state of CALIFORNIA only. For instructions on how to get your DOJ RAP sheet, see APPENDIX A, on PG. 1102.)Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet will list all of your cases from EVERY STATE as well as FEDERAL offenses. Use this if you have cases from more than one state or any federal convictions. For instructions on how to get your FBI RAP sheet, see APPENDIX D, on PG. 1109.</ol>

If you have multiple cases, especially if they are from different counties, it may be easier to get a copy of your full California RAP sheet (or FBI RAP sheet, if you also have federal or out-of-state cases). <em>Your lawyer, parole agent, probation officer, or other people at the courts or law enforcement agencies</em>. BUT these people may only have <em>limited information</em> about your case, or may have information about <em>1 case but NOT others</em>, so it’s better to go through the formal channels of getting your full RAP sheet.<em>The criminal court where your case was decided</em>. BUT the court will <em>only</em> have information for <em>cases from that county</em> and NOT other counties.

                <h4 class="textbox"><em>CA EXPUNGEMENT—A GENERAL OVERVIEW </em></h4>
                <p class="textbox">An expungement of a state conviction (also called a “dismissal”) is a way of <em>cleaning up your record</em> that <em>limits</em> the information that shows up in a <em>background check</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2843" id="footnote-ref-2843">[2843]</a></sup> and can relieve you of some of the consequences associated with your conviction.</p>
                <h4>What expungement does:</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">Prohibits information about the conviction from being included in <em>some</em> <em>background checks</em>;Releases you from most of the “penalties and disabilities” resulting from the conviction;Changes your record to show that the conviction was dismissed (but does NOT remove the offense from your official criminal record (RAP) entirely). </ul>
                <h4>What convictions can be expunged? </h4>
                <ul class="textbox">A conviction may qualify for expungement if:You did NOT spend any time in prison for the offense; ANDYou completed any term of supervision for the offense; ANDYou are NOT currently charged with, serving a sentence for, or on a term of supervision for another offense.<em>Note</em>: Certain convictions are NEVER eligible for expungement.</ul>
                <h4>How do I get an expungement?</h4>
                <ul class="textbox">You must file a petition with the court;You may have a hearing where you will have to persuade a judge that you deserve an expungement;You may have to give the court documents that support your request, such as letters of support, school transcripts, and diplomas or certificates. </ul>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153909"></a>What is “expungement”(a dismissal) in California?</h3>
                <p class="text">Expungement (also called dismissal) is a way to <em>clean up your record</em>, by <em>limiting</em> the criminal history information that <em>certain</em> people can see in your <em>background check</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2844" id="footnote-ref-2844">[2844]</a></sup><em> </em>and relieves you of some of the consequences associated with your conviction. An expungement is also called a “dismissal” because your case is actually reopened by the court, the “finding of guilt” (your guilty or no contest plea, or guilty verdict) is withdrawn, and a plea of <em>not guilty</em> is entered. The court will then dismiss your case, and your record will be changed to show a dismissal (under Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4) rather than a conviction. Getting your conviction expunged hides the conviction from certain people when they run a <em>background check</em> on you. For example, most private employers are NOT allowed to see a conviction that has been expunged.<sup><a href="#footnote-2845" id="footnote-ref-2845">[2845]</a></sup> Additionally, most private employers CANNOT ask you about, or even consider, a conviction that has been expunged when you apply for a job.<sup><a href="#footnote-2846" id="footnote-ref-2846">[2846]</a></sup> For information on how to get a conviction expunged, see PG. 1065.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Expungement does NOT erase the offense from your criminal record or RAP sheet. But it DOES <em>change</em> your record to show the conviction was dismissed.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2847" id="footnote-ref-2847">[2847]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153910"></a><a id="Expung_Ques_California_expungementDo"></a>What does expungement do?</h3>
                <ol class="text">An expungement makes it so that <em>most</em> private employers CANNOT see the expunged conviction when they run a background check on you. On job applications for (most) <em>private</em> employers, if you are asked if you have any convictions, you can answer NO.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2848" id="footnote-ref-2848">[2848]</a></sup></sup> NOTE: On applications for certain jobs, you MUST report convictions even if they have been expunged. (For more information about who can still see or ask about expunged convictions, see PG. 1057.Several California cities and counties have passed “Ban the Box” laws that bar employers from asking about convictions on a job application. If you apply for a job in a location with a “Ban the Box” law, the application should not ask about any convictions. For more information on Ban the Box laws, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 613.Anyone else who does see the expungement will see it as a dismissal instead of a conviction, which is less alarming.If you apply for a professional or occupational license or certification, an expungement can help your chances because it is seen as <em>evidence of rehabilitation</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2849" id="footnote-ref-2849">[2849]</a></sup></sup> (Although the licensing board will still be able to see that there was a conviction that was dismissed.) For more information on licensing and certification, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 613.An expungement may also be seen as evidence of rehabilitation when you apply for housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2850" id="footnote-ref-2850">[2850]</a></sup></sup> Learn more in the HOUSING CHAPTER, PG. 398).If you were denied federal student loans because of a drug conviction, you will become eligible again after an expungement.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2851" id="footnote-ref-2851">[2851]</a></sup></sup> For more information about regaining eligibility for federal aid after a drug conviction, see the EDUCATION CHAPTER, on PG. 981, and EDUCATION CHAPTER: Appendix B, on PG. 1003).</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you are a non-citizen and you have been convicted of a DUI offense, getting your conviction expunged might have special immigration benefits for you.

This means you can still be charged with “felon in possession” offenses if the conviction caused you to lose your gun rights.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2856" id="footnote-ref-2856">[2856]</a></sup></sup>If your conviction required you to register as a sex offender, you will still have to register after the conviction is expunged.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2857" id="footnote-ref-2857">[2857]</a></sup></sup> Expungement will NOT prevent the DMV from suspending or revoking your driver license based on the underlying offense.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2858" id="footnote-ref-2858">[2858]</a></sup></sup>You will still have to disclose your conviction when applying for certain types of jobs, such a law enforcement or working with children, and employers in these areas can still consider your expunged conviction when deciding whether to hire you. (For more information, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 613.)You will still have to disclose your conviction when applying for government-issued licenses (such as professional or occupational licenses or certificates), and licensing agencies can still consider an expunged conviction when deciding whether to issue you a license.<sup><a href="#footnote-2859" id="footnote-ref-2859">[2859]</a></sup> However a professional or occupational licensing board CANNOT deny your license based <em>solely</em> on a conviction that was expunged.<sup><a href="#footnote-2860" id="footnote-ref-2860">[2860]</a></sup> (For more information, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 654.) Expungement does NOT restore your right to hold public office if you lost this right due to your conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2861" id="footnote-ref-2861">[2861]</a></sup></sup>Expungement does NOT remove the immigration consequences of your conviction, so Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement (ICE) can still use the expunged conviction for removal or exclusion.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2862" id="footnote-ref-2862">[2862]</a></sup></sup> Talk to an immigration attorney for help if you have this issue!</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153912"></a>Who can see my record—even if it is expunged?</h3>
                <p class="text"><strong>Anyone with access to your RAP sheet will still see your expunged convictions</strong> (see SIDE BOX). This <em>includes law enforcement agencies, courts, licensing boards</em>, and <em>certain employers</em>. You must disclose expunged convictions if you are applying for a <em>job</em> in certain fields such as <em>law enforcement</em>,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2863" id="footnote-ref-2863">[2863]</a></sup></sup> <em>healthcare</em>,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2864" id="footnote-ref-2864">[2864]</a></sup></sup> or <em>banking</em>,<sup><a href="#footnote-2865" id="footnote-ref-2865">[2865]</a></sup> or if you want to apply for a <em>professional or occupational license</em> of any kind.<sup><a href="#footnote-2866" id="footnote-ref-2866">[2866]</a></sup> <em>Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), which run many government-assisted housing programs</em> can also consider convictions that have been expunged.</p>
                <h4>2 things to know: </h4>
                <ol class="text">Certain employers and most licensing agencies are <em>required</em> to ask about expunged convictions—and you MUST disclose this information if they do. However, these groups will also understand what an expungement means—they will know that you are making an effort to clean up your record by having the original conviction expunged.Although it is <em>illegal</em> for most private employers to <em>ask about</em> or <em>consider</em> expunged convictions when making hiring decisions,<sup><a href="#footnote-2867" id="footnote-ref-2867">[2867]</a></sup> be prepared for unethical or uninformed employers to access and use this information anyway. For more information about what to do in this situation, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 613.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153913"></a>Can a private employer find out about my expunged conviction?</h3>
                <p class="text"><em>Maybe</em>. There are two ways that a private employer might find out about your expunged conviction:</p>
                <ol class="text">Even though background check companies are NOT allowed to report expunged convictions to employers, it is possible that a company might include this information in your background check anyway;If an employer does its own “in-house” background check on you, they may find the information in (public) court records about your case. Remember, expungement does NOT seal the court records from your case, so someone could still look up the original conviction in your files. However, it is still <em>illegal</em> for most private employers to consider an expunged conviction, even if they learn about it through public records.</ol>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_WhatTypeConvCanExpung"></a><a id="_Toc448153914"></a>What types of convictions can be expunged?</h3>
                <p class="text">Under the law, only <em>certain types of convictions</em> can be expunged. Generally, the following types of convictions qualify for expungement: </p>
                <ol class="text">the CONVICTION is for:An Infraction,A Misdemeanor, orFelony “wobbler” (with NO prison time); ANDthe SENTENCE imposed was:County jail time,Probation, A fine, orA combination of these.<sup><a href="#footnote-2868" id="footnote-ref-2868">[2868]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text"><em>This means that as long as you were sentenced only to pay a fine, serve a term of probation, OR serve time in county jail—even for a felony “wobbler”—your conviction may be eligible for expungement. </em>IN ADDITION, you must meet the following requirements for your conviction to be eligible for expungement. In general, these requirements are:</p>
                <ol class="text">You did NOT spend any time in prison for the offense; ANDYou are OFF probation or other type of supervision; ANDYou are NOT currently charged with, serving a sentence for, or on a term of supervision for another offense.</ol>
                <p class="text"><em>PLEASE NOTE</em>: Certain convictions are NEVER eligible for expungement (see the next question).For information more information about the <em>types of California expungement</em>, see PG. 1061.</p>
                <p class="importantbox"> IMPORTANT: You must be OFF PROBATION or any other form of supervision to be eligible for expungement!<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2869" id="footnote-ref-2869">[2869]</a></sup></strong> If you are still on probation and want to get your conviction expunged, you must first ask a judge to grant you early release (“early discharge”) from probation BEFORE requesting an expungement. For more information on requesting early release from probation, see PG. 1066.</p>

                <p class="text">Some convictions are NEVER ELIGIBLE for expungement. They are:</p>
                <ol class="text">Any conviction where you SERVED a prison term (or any other facility run by CDCR, including prison camps and prison hospitals)—no matter what your conviction was for!<sup> </sup>Violations of the following code sections:Any infraction under California Vehicle Code section 42001 (violations of any local ordinance, minor traffic tickets, pedestrian and bicycle offenses);Any misdemeanor under California Vehicle Code section 42002.1 (failing to stop and submit to vehicle inspection, refusing to comply with orders from law enforcement officer or firefighter, unsafe condition that endangers a person);Any conviction (felony or misdemeanor) under California Penal Code sections 286(c), 288, 288a(c), 288.5, 289(j), 311.1, 311.2, 311.3, 311.11; or a felony conviction under California Penal Code sections 261.5(d).<sup><a href="#footnote-2870" id="footnote-ref-2870">[2870]</a></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">is it a “Wobbler”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by checking the California Penal Code section reported on your RAP sheet. If the code states that the crime is punishable either a fine, time in the county jail, time in state prison, or any combination of these, your offense is considered a wobbler.<strong> </strong></p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_CanGetFelExpung"></a><a id="_Toc448153916"></a>Because I have a felony conviction, but never went to prison for it, can I get it expunged?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. If you were convicted of a felony, but you were NOT sentenced to serve a state prison term, your offense is called a “wobbler.” A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as <em>either</em> a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense “wobbles” between the two offense categories. If you were convicted of a felony<em> wobbler</em> AND you were NOT sentenced to a state prison term, your offense is probably eligible for expungement. “Wobblers” are eligible for expungement if:<sup><a href="#footnote-2871" id="footnote-ref-2871">[2871]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to a state prison term for the offense; You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG. 1059); ANDYou otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for information on the two types of expungement and their requirements, see PG. 1061). </ol>
                <p class="text"><em>If you meet the above requirements, your felony should be eligible for expungement. </em></p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Part2_CAExpung_RealignmentFelony"></a><a id="_Toc448153917"></a>Because I have a felony conviction that was sentenced to county jail under Realignment instead of state prison, can i get it expunged?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. If you were convicted of a felony and sentenced to county jail instead of state prison (called a “<em>County Jail Felony</em>”) under California’s Realignment Act,<sup><a href="#footnote-2872" id="footnote-ref-2872">[2872]</a></sup> you may be eligible for expungement under California’s newest expungement law.<sup><a href="#footnote-2873" id="footnote-ref-2873">[2873]</a></sup> This law is specifically intended for people who were sentenced under Realignment. To be eligible for expungement of your Realignment felony, you must:</p>
                <ol class="text">Have served your entire sentence in county jail—NOT state prison;Have completed your entire sentence—including any probation or community supervision;Paid all of your fines and fees; ANDNot have any new charges pending, not be serving a sentence on a new case, and not be on probation for another case.</ol>
                <h4 class="textbox">What is a SPLIT sentence vs. a STRAIGHT sentence?</h4>
                <p class="textbox">Under California’s Realignment Act, people who are sentenced to county jail instead of prison for felony convictions, can be sentenced in two ways:</p>
                <ul class="textbox"><strong>Straight sentence</strong>—a person is sentenced to serve their entire sentence in custody. When they are released, they have completed their entire sentence and are not required to serve any term of supervision.<strong>Split sentence</strong>—a person is sentenced to spend a portion of their time in custody and the remainder under community supervision (mandatory supervision). </ul>
                <p class="text">Additionally, BEFORE you can get your conviction expunged, you must wait a certain amount of time after completing your sentence:</p>
                <ol class="text">If you had a split sentence, you must wait 1 year after the completion of your sentence.If you had a straight sentence, you must wait 2 years after the completion of your sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2874" id="footnote-ref-2874">[2874]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Finally, expungement under this statute is entirely discretionary, meaning it is <em>up to the judge to decide</em> whether or not your conviction should be expunged. For this reason, you should be prepared to bring any <em>evidence</em> you can to show the judge that <em>you deserve to have your conviction expunged</em>. (For more information on discretionary expungements, see PG. 1062.)</p>

                <ol class="text"><em>Mandatory</em> expungement is automatic, meaning the judge MUST expunge your conviction if you meet all the requirements. <em>Discretionary</em> expungement means that it is up to the judge whether or not you deserve to have your conviction expunged.

                <p class="text">If your conviction is <em>eligible </em>for expungement AND<em> </em>you meet certain additional requirements, the law says that the judge MUST<em> </em>dismiss your conviction.

The judge will probably want to see that at least you have been <em>making efforts</em> to pay your debts, even if you still owe money. For more information on paying restitution, fines, and other fees, see the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 717. It’s also good to contact lawyer to get advice on your individual case, since restitution is different for every case. See the list of legal aid providers to find a lawyer who may be able to help you on PG. 1180.</p>
                <p class="text">In order to grant a discretionary dismissal, the judge must find that is “<em>in the interests of justice</em>” to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-2891" id="footnote-ref-2891">[2891]</a></sup> This means you will need to show a <em>very convincing reason</em> why you deserve to have your conviction expunged. You should give the court as much helpful information as possible (including evidence of rehabilitation) to persuade the judge to decide in your favor!</p>

                <p class="text">The following information will guide you through the general process of requesting an expungement in California, but it is always a good idea to get a lawyer’s help to make sure you get the best results. There are many expungement clinics across the state that offer free services and advice. For a list of expungement clinics and legal aid organizations that offer expungement services, see PG. 1180.<em>A NOTE ABOUT COURT FEES: </em>Be aware that the court will charge you fees for filing documents with the court. The amount of the fees will vary by county. If you cannot afford to pay the fees, you can request a fee waiver (meaning you may not have to pay the fees). Ask the clerk how much the fees are and how to request a fee waiver. </p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_CAExpung_HowTo"></a><a id="_Toc448153921"></a>I believe I am eligible for a mandatory or discretionary expungement. How do I get one?</h3>
                <p class="text">In most cases, you will need to file papers in court and ask a judge to expunge your conviction. This process is called filing a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, and is basically the same for both mandatory and discretionary expungements, with a few small differences. You will need to file the proper forms in the court where you were convicted, and you may have a hearing in front of a judge (especially if you are requesting a discretionary expungement). For a detailed explanation of each step, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have convictions from multiple cases, you will need to file a separate petition for each <em>case</em>.</p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_CAExp_HowAutomaticExpung"></a><a id="_Toc448153922"></a>If my conviction is eligible to be expunged automatically, how does this happen? </h3>
                <p class="text">Under the law, certain drug convictions will be expunged from your record <em>automatically</em>, without you having to file a petition in court. This happens in the following 2 situations:</p>
                <ol class="text"> Successful completion of a drug diversion program:<sup><a href="#footnote-2893" id="footnote-ref-2893">[2893]</a></sup> In some cases, if you were charged with a drug offense, the judge will <em>suspend your sentence</em> so that you can complete <em>drug treatment</em> instead of going to jail. If the judge suspended your sentence and ordered you to do a drug-treatment program (<em>drug diversion</em>), and you successfully completed the program, your records will be automatically expunged.<em>NOTE: This remedy is available ONLY if you were given drug diversion by the court AND you successfully completed all court-ordered requirements. If you did NOT complete your requirements, or you were NOT actually given diversion by the court, then the conviction will still be on your record (even if you completed a drug treatment program on your own).</em>Minor Marijuana Convictions:<sup><a href="#footnote-2894" id="footnote-ref-2894">[2894]</a></sup>If you have a minor marijuana conviction on your record, your record will be cleaned <em>automatically</em> if: Your conviction was for “<em>simple possession</em>” of marijuana; ANDThe conviction occurred <em>after January 1, 1976</em>; ANDThe conviction is <em>more than 2 years old</em>.After 2 years, all records relating to your arrest and conviction will be destroyed. You will be able to say that you have NO arrests or convictions for this case.<em>NOTE: This automatic erasure of minor marijuana convictions is ONLY for convictions related to possession of less than 1 ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana for personal use. If your conviction was for cultivation, sales, or transportation of marijuana, it will NOT be erased automatically.</em></ol>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of January 1, 2011, simple possession of marijuana is no longer a misdemeanor offense; it is now only an infraction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2895" id="footnote-ref-2895">[2895]</a></sup> Although minor marijuana infractions are supposed to be erased automatically just like other minor marijuana (misdemeanor) convictions, in practice, this doesn’t always happen! If you find that your marijuana infraction has NOT been erased from your record, you will need to contact the court clerk at the court that handled your case and ask him or her to (1) correct your criminal record and (2) destroy all arrest and conviction records from your case. </p>
                <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_EarlyReleaseProb_forExpung"></a><a id="_Toc448153923"></a>Because I am still on probation and need to be off to have my conviction expunged, is there anything I can do to get off early? </h3>
                <p class="text">Yes. Under California law, you can ask the judge to release you early from your probation term (called “<em>early discharge</em>”).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2896" id="footnote-ref-2896">[2896]</a></sup></sup> Although courts often sentence people to several years on probation (for example, 3-4 years for a misdemeanor), many people are able to complete all of their probation requirements (all of the things the court has ordered them to do—such as attend counseling or pay restitution) long before their time is up. For this reason, courts are often willing to release people early from their probation. For more information about probation terms and conditions, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 130.You can request early release from probation whether you are on <em>informal</em> probation (also called <em>court probation</em>), <em>formal</em> probation, or <em>mandatory supervision</em>. The process is the same for all three.<sup><a href="#footnote-2897" id="footnote-ref-2897">[2897]</a> </sup>However. early release from supervision in order to get your conviction expunged ONLY applies if you are on informal or formal PROBATION or Mandatory Supervision. It does NOT apply if you are on parole or PRCS. Although you CAN get off parole and PRCS early, you still CANNOT get your conviction expunged because you will have served a prison sentence for it. For more information about the difference between formal and informal probation, PRCS, and parole, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 130. For more information about getting released early from PRCS, see PG. 1067, or see also the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 130.</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Need help with your court forms? </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Remember, it is recommended that ask a lawyer to help you with your Motion for Early Termination forms. But if you cannot get a lawyer or want to do it on your own, you can find helpful information on the California Courts website:</p>

                <p class="text">To request early release from probation, you will need to file a <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em> in the court where you were convicted. Because this process requires drafting a formal court pleading with accompanying documents, we recommend that you ask a lawyer for help. Ideally, you should contact the lawyer who represented you when you were sentenced, but any private criminal defense lawyer or Public Defender should be able to help you. Requesting an early release from probation will involve filing a Motion for Early Termination of Probation. You will have a hearing where you will need to convince the judge that you deserve to be discharged from your probation term early. For complete details on each step of the process for requesting an early release from probation, see APPENDIX P, on PG. 1129. </p>
                <h4>You will have the best chance of getting released early from probation early if:</h4>
                <ol class="text">You have not violated your probation in any way;<sup><a href="#footnote-2898" id="footnote-ref-2898">[2898]</a></sup> You have completed the requirements of your probation (finished all classes, paid all restitution<sup><a href="#footnote-2899" id="footnote-ref-2899">[2899]</a></sup> and fines, etc.);<sup><a href="#footnote-2900" id="footnote-ref-2900">[2900]</a></sup> AND You are at least halfway through your probationary period (i.e. 1 ½ years of a 3-year probation).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2901" id="footnote-ref-2901">[2901]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">For more information about probation conditions and requirements, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 130. For more information about paying court-ordered restitution and fines, see the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, on PG. 717.</p>
                <h4>Courts also often consider other positive efforts that you have made in your life, such as:<strong><em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2902" id="footnote-ref-2902">[2902]</a></sup></sup></em></strong></h4>
                <ol class="text">Employment or efforts to find a job;<sup><a href="#footnote-2903" id="footnote-ref-2903">[2903]</a></sup>Community service or volunteer work;<sup><a href="#footnote-2904" id="footnote-ref-2904">[2904]</a></sup> andEducational pursuits and school accomplishments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2905" id="footnote-ref-2905">[2905]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">For this reason, you should make every effort to look for a job, volunteer, or go back to school, and you should emphasize these efforts and accomplishments in your <em>Motion for Early Termination</em>. For more information on finding work and getting a job, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, on PG. 595. For more information on educational opportunities, see the EDUCATION CHAPTER, on PG. 922.</p>
                <h4>Finally, the judge may consider:</h4>
                <ol class="text">The severity of your conviction and conduct;Your complete criminal history (i.e., other convictions on your record);The prosecutor’s opinion; andHow much hardship it will cause you to remain on probation (for example, whether being on probation is making it difficult for you to find work, reconnect with your family, apply for loans, or go back to school).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2906" id="footnote-ref-2906">[2906]</a></sup></sup></ol>

                <p class="text">Yes. Under the Realignment law, the maximum amount of time that you can be on Post-Release Community Supervision is 3 years (not including any time that your PRCS was revoked or suspended).<sup><a href="#footnote-2907" id="footnote-ref-2907">[2907]</a></sup> However, you can be released early in 2 situations: </p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Six months/No violations</strong>—If you have been on PRCS for 6 straight months with no violations, you may ask for an early release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2908" id="footnote-ref-2908">[2908]</a></sup> The process for requesting early release from PRCS is very similar to the process for requesting early release from regular probation (see APPENDIX P, on PG. 1129):<sup><a href="#footnote-2909" id="footnote-ref-2909">[2909]</a></sup> You will need to write a <em>motion</em> requesting an early release from PRCS, and <em>file</em> it in court in the county where you are on PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-2910" id="footnote-ref-2910">[2910]</a></sup> The main difference when you request an early release from PRCS is that the court will ask your probation officer for a probation report and use it to decide whether or not to release you early.<sup><a href="#footnote-2911" id="footnote-ref-2911">[2911]</a></sup> If you have been on PRCS for less than one year, it is entirely up to the judge whether or not to release you early, based on your motion and on what is in your probation report.<sup><a href="#footnote-2912" id="footnote-ref-2912">[2912]</a></sup> <strong>One year/No violations</strong>—If you have been on PRCS continuously for 1 year with no violations, you will <em>automatically</em> be discharged early, within 30 days after your 1-year anniversary.<sup><a href="#footnote-2913" id="footnote-ref-2913">[2913]</a></sup> the probation department does NOT discharge you automatically after If this time, you may need to file a motion in court asking the judge to discharge you.

                <p class="text">Generally, <em>early release</em> from probation and <em>expungement </em>of the underlying conviction go hand in hand. They usually happen at the <em>same court appearance</em>, one right after the other. You will file <em>both</em> a <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em> (see APPENDIX P, on PG. 1129) and a <em>Petition for Dismissal (</em>see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120). If the judge grants your <em>Early Release from Probation</em> motion, he or she will probably grant your <em>Dismissal Petition</em> also (as long as you meet all the other expungement requirements), so you could be <em>off probation</em> AND have your conviction <em>expunged</em> by the end of the day! </p>

                <p class="text">If you were convicted of a felony, your conviction can be reduced to a misdemeanor if ALL of the following apply:You were NOT sentenced to state prison<sup><a href="#footnote-2914" id="footnote-ref-2914">[2914]</a></sup> OR county jail instead of state prison under California’s Realignment Act<sup><a href="#footnote-2915" id="footnote-ref-2915">[2915]</a></sup> (in other words, your felony was a “wobbler” offense); ANDYou were sentenced to PROBATION.<sup><a href="#footnote-2916" id="footnote-ref-2916">[2916]</a></sup> NOTE THAT CERTAIN OFFENSES, referred to as “straight felonies,” can NEVER be reduced to misdemeanors. These “straight felonies” can only ever be charged and sentenced as felonies.<sup><a href="#footnote-2917" id="footnote-ref-2917">[2917]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153928"></a>What is a “wobbler” and why is it important for expungement?</h3>
                <p class="text">If you were convicted of a felony, but were NOT sentenced to a state prison term (or county jail under California’s Realignment Act), your offense is called a “wobbler.” A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as <em>either</em> a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense “wobbles” between the two offense categories. You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by reading the California Penal Code section that is listed on your RAP sheet. If it says that the offense is punishable by a fine or time in the county jail (misdemeanor sentences) OR time in state prison or “imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170”<sup><a href="#footnote-2918" id="footnote-ref-2918">[2918]</a></sup> (felony sentence), your offense is considered a wobbler.<sup><a href="#footnote-2919" id="footnote-ref-2919">[2919]</a></sup>Remember, felony “wobblers” are eligible for reduction and ultimately expungement if:<sup><a href="#footnote-2920" id="footnote-ref-2920">[2920]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to prison time for the offense; You were NOT sentenced to county jail instead of prisonunder Realignment;You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG. 1059); ANDYou otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for more information on these requirements, see PG. 1058). </ol>
                <p class="text">For more information on expunging a felony “wobbler” conviction, see PG. 1059.Although the law does not require you to be off probation, you will have a better chance of getting your conviction reduced if you have successfully completed probation first. For information on how to get off probation early, see PG. 1066.<strong> </strong></p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Felonies that CANNOT be reduced to misdemeanors. If you were sentenced to state prison OR sentenced to county jail for a straight felony under Realignment—even if the judge suspended your sentence so you never spent any time in custody—your conviction is NOT eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2921" id="footnote-ref-2921">[2921]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p class="text">However, if you <em>never spent any time in prison</em> and you were not sentenced to county jail instead of prison because of Realignment, you may still qualify to have your felony conviction expunged (see PG. 1059).<sup><a href="#footnote-2922" id="footnote-ref-2922">[2922]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">Having a felony conviction on your record (even after the conviction has been expunged) can be much more damaging than having only a misdemeanor. Reducing your felony “wobbler” conviction to a misdemeanor, whether or not you have it expunged, changes your criminal record so that—going forward—you no longer have a felony conviction on your record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2923" id="footnote-ref-2923">[2923]</a></sup></sup> Here are the benefits of reducing your felony “wobbler” to a misdemeanor: </p>
                <ol class="text">You can say that you were never convicted of a felony when applying for most jobs, housing, public benefits, loans, etc.;<sup><a href="#footnote-2924" id="footnote-ref-2924">[2924]</a></sup>You will no longer be disqualified from getting most professional and occupational licenses because of a felony conviction;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2925" id="footnote-ref-2925">[2925]</a></sup></sup>You may get back your <em>state</em> gun rights back;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2926" id="footnote-ref-2926">[2926]</a></sup></sup> ANDYou will get back your right to serve on a jury.<sup><a href="#footnote-2927" id="footnote-ref-2927">[2927]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: <em>Felony Reductions &amp; Immigration Issues</em>: As of January 1, 2015, the maximum jail time that a person can be sentenced to for a misdemeanor is 364 days--one day short of a full year. This could have significant meaning for you if you are at risk of being deported because of a felony conviction, and your conviction can be reduced to a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17(b). When you get your felony conviction reduced, it is suggested that you ask the judge to say <em>on the record</em> that the maximum sentence for your conviction is now 364 days. This could possibly help you avoid certain negative immigration consequences that are tied to a sentence of 365 days or more.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2928" id="footnote-ref-2928">[2928]</a></sup></strong> It is recommended that you contact a lawyer immediately for help in this situation.

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153930"></a>Are there penalties that will still affect me even if my felony is reduced to a misdemeanor?</h3>
                <p class="text"><em>Yes. </em>Unfortunately, reducing your felony conviction to a misdemeanor doesn’t get you completely off the felony hook. Some penalties will carry over and continue to affect you, even after your felony conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor. These include:</p>
                <ol class="text">If your conviction was for a serious or violent felony, it will still count as a prior “strike” under California’s Three Strikes Law;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2929" id="footnote-ref-2929">[2929]</a></sup></sup>If your conviction requires you to register as a sex offender under Penal Code section 290, you will still have to register after your felony is reduced;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2930" id="footnote-ref-2930">[2930]</a></sup></sup>You may still be subject to federal firearms restrictions;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2931" id="footnote-ref-2931">[2931]</a></sup></sup>Some state licensing agencies may still consider your conviction a felony.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2932" id="footnote-ref-2932">[2932]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Also, please note that getting your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17(b) does NOT give you any legal rights to be compensated for any time that you served that is more than what you could have been sentenced to if you had been convicted of a misdemeanor originally.</p>

                <p class="text">If you want to reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor AND get your conviction expunged, it is generally very easy to do both at the same time! In fact, the<em> Petition for Dismissal (Form CR—180) </em>that you must file to get your conviction expunged has a box that you can check to say that your conviction is also eligible to be reduced and to request it. Then, when you have your court hearing for your expungement, the judge will consider both requests—first your request to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, and then your request to have it expunged. If you meet all the requirements, the judge usually will grant both of your requests together. (For a list of the requirements for reducing a felony to a misdemeanor, see PG. 1068. For a list of requirements to get your conviction expunged, see PG. 1058.) For more details on how to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor, see APPENDIX R, on PG. 1138. If the judge does NOT reduce your felony to a misdemeanor, or if your felony is only eligible for reduction but not expungement, you may need to file a separate petition to get it reduced. It is recommended that you ask a lawyer to help you with this. For more information about filing a separate petition to ask for your felony conviction to be reduced, see APPENDIX R, on PG. 1138. </p>

                <p class="text">Unfortunately, if you were sentenced to state prison, or spent <em>any</em> time in a CDCR facility (including a prison camp or hospital) for your conviction (for <em>any</em> reason), your conviction does NOT qualify for expungement OR for reduction to a misdemeanor.<sup><a href="#footnote-2933" id="footnote-ref-2933">[2933]</a></sup> BUT, your conviction <em>may</em> still be eligible for Reclassification or Resentencing under Proposition 47, or you <em>may</em> be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation and/or a Governor’s Pardon.

                <p class="text">Proposition 47 (Prop 47) is a new law that was passed by voters in California and took effect in November of 2014.<sup><a href="#footnote-2934" id="footnote-ref-2934">[2934]</a></sup> Prop 47 changed the law so that certain <em>non-violent</em> offenses that previously could be charged as “wobblers” or straight felonies now can <em>only</em> be charged as straight misdemeanors. Prop 47 also applies to <em>past</em> convictions, which means that you might be able to get your past felony convictions changed to misdemeanors if they meet the requirements under the new law. If you are still serving a sentence for a conviction that qualifies for Prop 47, you may be able to get your sentence reduced. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153935"></a><a id="Expung_Part4_Prop47_convictionsOK"></a>What convictions does Prop 47 help to reduce?</h3>
                <p class="text">In general, Prop 47 applies to the following offenses:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Second Degree Burglary</strong>—Penal Code Section 459<strong>Forgery</strong>—Penal Code Sections 470, 475, 476<strong>Forgery, writing bad checks</strong>—Penal Code Section 476a<strong>Grand Theft</strong>—Penal Code Section 487<strong>Receiving Stolen Property</strong>—Penal Code Section 496(a)<strong>Petty Theft with a Prior</strong>—Penal Code Section 666<strong>Possession of Drugs for Personal Use</strong>—Health &amp; Safety Code Section 11350<strong>Possession of Concentrated Cannabis</strong>—Health &amp; Safety Code Section 11357(a)<strong>Possession of Meth</strong>—Health &amp; Safety Code Section 11377</ol>
                <p class="text">As of November 2014, anyone charged with one of these offenses can only be charged with a misdemeanor—NOT a felony. If you have a felony conviction for any of these offenses from before November of 2014, you may be able to get it changed to a misdemeanor under Prop 47 (called “<em>reclassification</em>”). If you are currently serving a felony sentence for a conviction of any of these offenses from before November 2014, you may be able to get your sentence reduced to a misdemeanor sentence (called “<em>resentencing</em>”). (For more information about how Prop 47 changes each of these offenses, see PG. 1074.)A Court of Appeal in California decided that the new Prop 47 reclassification law applies equally to juveniles with offenses covered by Prop 47.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2935" id="footnote-ref-2935">[2935]</a></sup></sup> This means that both juveniles AND adults can get eligible felonies reduced under Prop 47. Additionally, you can call your local Public Defender’s office for more information about Prop 47 in your county.</p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Your conviction will NOT qualify for Prop 47 if you also have a conviction for certain serious felony offenses. Below is a list of offenses that will disqualify you from using Prop 47 to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor.</p>

                <p class="text">Prop 47 affects eligible offenses in the following ways:<span class="emphasisitalic">Shoplifting (Penal Code section 459.5)</span>—Prop 47 adds a new offense, misdemeanor shoplifting. If you enter a business, during regular business hours and steal something worth less than $950, it is now shoplifting instead of second-degree burglary. If you are charged with shoplifting, now you cannot also be charged with petty theft or burglary. If you have a conviction for felony second-degree burglary (California Penal Code section 459), you may be able to get it reduced to misdemeanor shoplifting.<span class="emphasisitalic">Forgery (Penal Code sections 470, 471, 472, 475)</span>—Prop 47 changes the laws for several forgery offenses that previously could be charged as either misdemeanors or felonies. Now, all of these offenses are straight misdemeanors only. However, Prop 47 does NOT apply if you are convicted of both forgery and identity theft (Cal. Penal Code section 530.5). If you have a felony conviction for an eligible forgery offense, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Forgery/Writing Bad Checks (Penal Code section 476a)</span>—Prop 47 changes this offense from a “wobbler” to a straight misdemeanor if the amount of the check is less than $950. Beware, however, that Prop 47 does not apply if you have three or more prior forgery convictions. If you have a felony conviction for writing a bad check, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Theft (Penal Code section 490.2)</span>—Before Prop 47, an offense was classified as either GRAND THEFT (a felony) or PETTY THEFT (a misdemeanor) based on (1) the value of the property stolen, (2) the type of property stolen (i.e. guns or cars), OR (3) the manner in which the property was stolen (for example, from someone’s immediate possession). After Prop 47, the offense is classified based ONLY on whether the value of the property is more or less than $950. So, now if you steal something that is worth less than $950, you can only be charged with misdemeanor petty theft, regardless of what type of property you took or how you took it. If you have a felony grand theft conviction, you may be able to get it reduced to misdemeanor petty theft. <span class="emphasisitalic">Receiving Stolen Property (Penal Code Section 496)</span>—Prop 47 changes this offense to a straight misdemeanor if the value of the stolen property is under $950. If you have a felony conviction for receiving stolen property, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Petty Theft with a Prior (Penal Code Section 666)</span>—Before Prop 47, if you were charged with petty theft and had three or more previous theft convictions, you could have been charged with a felony. Now, for most people, you cannot be charged with a felony for petty theft, no matter how many prior petty theft convictions you have. The only way that you can be charged with <em>felony</em> petty theft under section 666 now is if you are already excluded from Prop 47 (see above for convictions that can exclude you), and you also have a previous conviction for petty theft, grand theft, elder financial abuse, joyriding, burglary, carjacking, robbery or felony receiving stolen property,<sup><a href="#footnote-2948" id="footnote-ref-2948">[2948]</a></sup> OR you are required to register as a sex offender. If you have a felony conviction for petty theft based on prior theft convictions, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. <span class="emphasisitalic">Simple Drug Possession (Health &amp; Safety Code Sections 11350, 11357, &amp; 11377)</span>—Under Prop 47, simple possession of pretty much any controlled substance is a straight misdemeanor.<sup><a href="#footnote-2949" id="footnote-ref-2949">[2949]</a></sup> If you have a felony conviction for simple drug possession, you may be able to get it reduced to a misdemeanor. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153940"></a>How do I get my conviction reduced under Prop 47?</h3>
                <p class="text">The process for getting a felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop 47 depends on whether you are currently still serving your sentence (“under sentence”) for the conviction, or if you have already completed your sentence. </p>
                <ol class="text"><em>If you are currently still serving your sentence</em> (meaning you are <em>incarcerated</em> OR on<em> parole or PRCS</em> for the qualifying conviction—also called being “<em>under sentence</em>”),<sup><a href="#footnote-2950" id="footnote-ref-2950">[2950]</a></sup> you must ask to be “resentenced.” (See PG. 1076 for information on resentencing.)<em>If you have already</em> <em>completed your sentence</em>, you must ask to have your conviction “reclassified.” (See PG. 1076 for information on reclassification.)<em>If you are currently on formal probation</em> for the qualifying offense, the courts are still figuring out whether you must ask for resentencing or reclassification. Some lawyers have been successful in convincing judges that you qualify for resentencing, which would could mean that you would be released from probation, so it is worthwhile to first ask to be resentenced if you’re still on formal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2951" id="footnote-ref-2951">[2951]</a></sup> </ol>

                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In general, you must apply for resentencing or reclassification before November 2017 (within 3 years of when the new law was passed), but this time limit can be waived (excused) if you have a good reason for not applying sooner.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2952" id="footnote-ref-2952">[2952]</a></sup></strong></p>

                <p class="text">If you are currently serving your sentence (“under sentence”) for an offense that qualifies under Prop 47, and you are NOT excluded by one of the disqualifying convictions, you may be eligible for RESENTENCING.<sup><a href="#footnote-2953" id="footnote-ref-2953">[2953]</a></sup> You will need to fill out and file a Petition for Resentencing, and you may need to request a hearing to convince the judge that you qualify for resentencing under Prop 47. If you qualify, the judge MUST resentence you unless s/he thinks you pose an “unreasonable risk to public safety.” If you have already served the amount of time that you would have served if you were originally convicted of a misdemeanor, you will be released or discharged from supervision. For information and instructions on how to petition for resentencing, including what “unreasonable risk to public safety” means, see APPENDIX T, on PG. 1146. Each local court has created its own version of this petition, so it’s recommended that you go to the court where you were convicted to request one.</p>

                <p class="text">If you already completed your sentence (including any parole or probation term) for an offense that qualifies under Prop 47, and you are NOT excluded by one of the disqualifying convictions, you may be eligible to have your felony RECLASSIFIED as a misdemeanor. Unfortunately, you cannot get back the time that you served for the felony, but you can change your criminal record to show a misdemeanor conviction instead of a felony conviction. (For information on the benefits of reducing a felony conviction to a misdemeanor, see PG. 1070.) Just as for resentencing, you will need to fill out and file a Petition for Reclassification (in most courts this is the same form as for resentencing). The judge will then review your petition to make sure that you qualify for reclassification. Generally, you will not need to request a hearing for a reclassification, however, in some circumstances you may need to. If you meet the requirements, the judge MUST reclassify your conviction as a misdemeanor. For information and instructions on how to petition for reclassification, including when you might need to request a hearing, see APPENDIX T, on PG. 1146.</p>

Generally, if you served any time in state prison for a felony conviction, you are not eligible to get your conviction expunged.<sup><a href="#footnote-2954" id="footnote-ref-2954">[2954]</a></sup> However, many lawyers believe that this is an oversight by the drafters of Prop 47, and feel that if your felony conviction is eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop 47, it should be eligible for expungement (like most misdemeanors) as well. Some lawyers have had success getting discretionary expungements for Prop 47 convictions under California Penal Code section 1203.4a (which allows expungement of misdemeanor convictions with sentences <em>other than probation</em>).<sup><a href="#footnote-2955" id="footnote-ref-2955">[2955]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">PROP 47 AND FEDERAL SENTENCESEven though Prop 47 only applies to state convictions, it may still help you if you are serving time for a <em>federal</em> conviction. If your federal sentence was <em>increased</em> because you had a prior <em>state</em> conviction, and that state conviction can be reduced to a misdemeanor under Prop 47, that conviction should no longer have as much impact on your federal sentence, which may mean that your total federal sentence can be reduced.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2956" id="footnote-ref-2956">[2956]</a></sup></strong> If you are serving a federal sentence and you have prior state convictions, it is recommended that you contact the federal lawyer who represented you, the federal public defender, or the county public defender where you were convicted immediately.</p>

If you have a California conviction but no longer live in California, you may be eligible for a Governor’s Pardon (see PG. 1082). If your conviction is <em>from another state</em>, you will not be eligible to clean up your record using the California remedies described in this chapter. However, many other states provide similar remedies, so you should find out what “cleaning” remedies are available in the state where your conviction is from.If you have a <em>federal</em> conviction, possible remedies for cleaning up federal criminal records start on PG. 1092. </p>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you ONLY have misdemeanor convictions on your criminal record, you are NOT eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation. Instead, it is recommended that you try to get your conviction(s) dismissed under California’s expungement statute (see PG. 1055). BUT there is one <em>exception</em>—if you were convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense (listed in California Penal Code Section 290), then you <em>may</em> be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation AFTER you get your conviction expunged.

                <p class="sidebox">A COR does NOT restore your right to vote if you lost this right due to your conviction. However, you will get your voting rights back <em>automatically</em> once you are out of prison and OFF parole, so you do <em>not</em> need a COR to get your voting rights back.

                <p class="text">Although there are many benefits to obtaining a COR, it is a <em>limited</em> remedy. Here are some of the things that a COR does NOT do for you:</p>

                <p class="text">Before you can apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, you must complete a “<em>period of rehabilitation</em>”<sup><a href="#footnote-2972" id="footnote-ref-2972">[2972]</a></sup> to show that you have improved your life and avoided involvement in any more criminal activity since your release from prison or jail. In general, you must wait a minimum of five years before you can apply for a COR, PLUS an additional number of years depending on what your conviction was for. You must also have completed your parole or probation term, but your period of rehabilitation starts running as soon as you are released from prison or jail and includes any time you spent on supervision. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Even if you have not completed your entire period of rehabilitation, you are allowed to request a COR early (as long as you are NOT required to register as a sex offender under California Penal Code Section 290). The judge may grant you a COR early, if s/he finds that it is “<em>in the interests of justice</em>” to do so.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2973" id="footnote-ref-2973">[2973]</a></sup></sup></strong> The judge will consider your good conduct, rehabilitation efforts, and how important getting a COR is to your success in the future. </p>

                <p class="text">You <em>are allowed to</em> apply for a COR if you have a new conviction during your period of rehabilitation.

                <p class="text">If you meet all of the eligibility requirements for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (see PG. 1078) AND you have completed your period of rehabilitation (or you want to request a COR early), you will need to file papers (called a <em>Petition for Certificate of Rehabilitation</em>) in the court in the county where you <em>currently live</em>. Your petition will explain why you deserve a COR, and should include letters of support and proof of your accomplishments. The judge may ask the DA to do an investigation and prepare a report on your life since your release. Then you will have a hearing where you will have to convince the judge that you are rehabilitated and ready to be a responsible member of society. NOTE: You must request a Certificate of Rehabilitation from the court in the county <em>where you currently live</em>. This is different from most other remedies (such as expungement, reducing your felony to a misdemeanor, and Prop 47), which require you to request them from the court <em>where you were convicted</em>.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153951"></a>What is a Governor’s pardon?</h3>
                <p class="text">A governor’s pardon is an official forgiveness for your conviction, granted by the Governor of California. A pardon can potentially restore all of the rights you lost due to your conviction—including your gun rights and your right to serve on a jury—as well as eliminate your requirement to register as a sex offender. It is the best thing you can do to reduce the impact of your criminal record on your life, but it is still not a complete remedy because it does not make it as if the conviction never happened. (For more information on what a pardon does and does NOT do for you, see PG. 1083.) A California Governor’s pardon is an honor traditionally granted only to individuals who have demonstrated exemplary behavior following conviction for a felony.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2980" id="footnote-ref-2980">[2980]</a></sup></sup> A pardon by the Governor is an official acknowledgement of your rehabilitation, by the state’s highest elected official. A Governor’s pardon provides significant relief from the collateral civil consequences of a criminal conviction. Both the California Penal Code and the California Constitution give the Governor the authority to grant a pardon, and that authority is entirely discretionary.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2981" id="footnote-ref-2981">[2981]</a></sup></sup> Unfortunately, Governor’s pardons are difficult to get and are NOT granted very often, so you should try to clean up your record using other remedies first—such as an expungement or a Certificate of Rehabilitation. </p>
                <h4 class="textbox">Governor’s Pardons vs.<br/> Felony Reductions, Reclassifications &amp; Resentencing</h4>
                <p class="textbox">In most cases, you are NOT eligible for a Governor’s pardon if you ONLY have misdemeanor convictions on your criminal record. (In other words, you must have a felony conviction to get a pardon.) If you reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor under California Penal Code section 17(b) (see PG. 1068), or have it reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop 47 (see PG. 1072), you could become ineligible for a Governor’s pardon (unless you also have other felony convictions on your record). HOWEVER, in most cases it’s still better to have your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor—even if that makes you ineligible for a Governor’s pardon—for these reasons:</p>
                <ul class="textbox">It is MUCH easier to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor than it is to get a Governor’s pardon. Governor’s pardons are very rare, and you should not count on getting one.Getting your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor removes the felony from your criminal record and allows you to say that you were never convicted of a felony for that offense. But a Governor’s pardon does NOT remove, erase, or seal the conviction on your record, so you will still have to disclose that you have a felony conviction even if you have been pardoned.</ul>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If your conviction is eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, you should absolutely apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation <em>first</em>, BEFORE seeking a pardon. Getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation almost ensures your chance of getting a pardon AND will automatically serve as your application for one (so you will not have to do anything else to apply!)</p>

If you do NOT have a Certificate of Rehabilitation yet, but your conviction is eligible for one, you can apply for a COR as soon as you’ve completed your period of rehabilitation.

                <h4 class="sidebox">What happens to my RAP sheet if my arrest record is sealed?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If your arrest record is sealed, all information about the arrest is deleted from your RAP sheet, and a new RAP sheet is issued <em>without</em> any information about the arrest. ALL records from the arrest are destroyed, including your fingerprint card.When your arrest record is sealed, the arrest (and anything associated with it) is considered NEVER to have happened.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153964"></a>What does it mean to have an arrest record “sealed” in California?</h3>
                <p class="text">Although California law limits who can consider your arrest record and for what purposes, it is always a good idea to have an arrest cleared from your record, <em>if possible</em>. This process is called “sealing” the arrest record. It means that ALL documents related to your arrest—including your fingerprints—are confidentially sealed for 3 years, and then destroyed.<sup><a href="#footnote-3015" id="footnote-ref-3015">[3015]</a></sup> The benefit of having your arrest record sealed is that it <em>deletes the information from your RAP sheet</em> (your official criminal record), meaning NOT even law enforcement officers will see the information in most cases. Once your arrest record is sealed, it is as if the <em>arrest (and any related proceedings) never happened.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-3016" id="footnote-ref-3016">[3016]</a></sup> (For more information on who can see your RAP sheet, see PG. 1046.)</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153965"></a>What arrest records can be sealed by the court?</h3>
                <p class="text">Any arrest that did NOT lead to a conviction is eligible to be sealed. You can ask to have your arrest record sealed if you were arrested, but: </p>
                <ol class="text">The DA NEVER filed charges against you in court;<sup><a href="#footnote-3017" id="footnote-ref-3017">[3017]</a></sup> ORThe DA offered you a diversion program instead of filing charges (and you successfully completed it);<sup><a href="#footnote-3018" id="footnote-ref-3018">[3018]</a></sup> ORThe DA filed charges against you, but the case was dismissed;<sup><a href="#footnote-3019" id="footnote-ref-3019">[3019]</a></sup> The DA filed charges, but the judge sent you to a diversion program instead (and you successfully completed it);<sup><a href="#footnote-3020" id="footnote-ref-3020">[3020]</a></sup> OR</ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">what is “Factual innocence”?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">“Factual innocence” means that “no reasonable cause exists” for a judge to think that you did what you were arrested for. It is a very high and difficult standard to meet. In most cases, even if your case was dismissed or you were acquitted by a jury, a judge is still not likely to find you “factually innocent<em>.</em>” Examples of factual innocence include: the police arrested you because they thought you were someone else; what you did was not actually illegal; or your arrest was the result of police misconduct.</p>
                <ol class="text">The DA filed charges against you, but you were acquitted at trial;<sup><a href="#footnote-3021" id="footnote-ref-3021">[3021]</a></sup> The DA filed charges, you were <em>convicted</em> at trial, but the judge set aside your conviction.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153966"></a>Are there other legal requirements for getting an arrest record sealed?</h3>
                <p class="text">Yes.<em> </em>In order to have your arrest record sealed, you must fit into one of the following situations:</p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>You are found to be “Factually Innocent”</strong>If you were arrested but:You were never charged;Your charges were dismissed;You were acquitted at trial; ORYou were convicted, but your conviction was set aside.AND you meet the following requirements:A judge finds you “factually innocent” of the charges for which you were arrested. A person is considered “factually innocent” when a court finds that “no reasonable cause exists to believe that the person committed the offense for which the arrest was made;”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3022" id="footnote-ref-3022">[3022]</a></sup></sup> You were an adult when you were arrested. (If you were a juvenile when you were arrested, see PG. 1090 for information on cleaning up juvenile records);<sup><a href="#footnote-3023" id="footnote-ref-3023">[3023]</a></sup>The arrest was for a misdemeanor or felony (NOT an infraction);<sup><a href="#footnote-3024" id="footnote-ref-3024">[3024]</a></sup> <em>AND</em>You were not convicted of any other crime connected to that same arrest.<sup><a href="#footnote-3025" id="footnote-ref-3025">[3025]</a></sup><strong>You were Ordered to do a Diversion Program</strong>If you were arrested ANDThe DA offered you a diversion program instead of charging you; ORYou were charged, but the judge sent you to a diversion program.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153967"></a>When could I get my arrest record sealed?</h3>
                <p class="text">Generally, you must file a request to have your arrest record sealed within 2 years after the date of your arrest OR the date that charges were filed against you (whichever is later). However, the judge can waive (excuse) the 2-year time limit if you can show “<em>good cause</em>”<sup><a href="#footnote-3026" id="footnote-ref-3026">[3026]</a></sup>—meaning you can give the judge a really good reason why you <em>could not</em> or <em>did not</em> file your petition within the 2-year limit. Since many people will be beyond the 2-year time limit, these are some examples of reasons that may qualify as “good cause:”</p>
                <ol class="text">If the charges are dismissed or you are acquitted more than 2 years after the date of your arrest or charging;If the DA waited more than 2 years after the arrest, and then decided not to file charges;In some cases, if you were trying to resolve your case informally, but were unsuccessful (but don’t wait too long afterward!).<sup><a href="#footnote-3027" id="footnote-ref-3027">[3027]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text">Keep in mind, however, that it will be up to the judge to decide whether your reason is good enough to waive the 2-year limit.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153968"></a>What is the process for getting my arrest record sealed?</h3>
                <p class="text">The process for getting your arrest record sealed varies slightly, depending on your situation: </p>
                <ol class="text">If you were arrested but never charged, you will need to start with the law enforcement agency that arrested you, and ask to have your records sealed. If the law enforcement agency refuses to seal your records (or doesn’t respond), you can file your request in court; ORIf you were arrested and charges were filed, you should take your request straight to the court first. </ol>
                <p class="text">Either way, your claim will be reviewed, and you may have a hearing to convince the judge that you are factually innocent. If you are found factually innocent by either the law enforcement agency or the court, the records of your arrest will be sealed and eventually destroyed. For information and instructions for each step of this process, see APPENDIX X, on PG. 1154.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153969"></a><a id="Expung_Part8_SealingJuvenileRecords"></a>Sealing California State Juvenile Records </h1>
                <p class="text">It is a common misperception that juvenile criminal records are automatically sealed when you turn 18. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If you have a juvenile record in California, you must ask the court to have it sealed, otherwise this information may find its way into your background check.</p>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> This section refers only to <strong><em>sealing juvenile records</em></strong> from California. Every state has different laws for handling juvenile records.<sup><a href="#footnote-3028" id="footnote-ref-3028">[3028]</a></sup> If you have a juvenile record from another state, you will need to find out what remedies are available in that state.<sup><a href="#footnote-3029" id="footnote-ref-3029">[3029]</a></sup> Additionally, federal juvenile records can be sealed only under the very limited circumstances (the same as federal adult convictions).<sup><a href="#footnote-3030" id="footnote-ref-3030">[3030]</a></sup> If you have a federal juvenile record, it is recommended that you speak to a Federal Public Defender. Read about sealing federal adult records on PG. 1092.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153970"></a>What could show up in my juvenile record?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your juvenile record is made up of all documents, exhibits, judge’s rulings, orders, and reports associated with any trouble you got into before you turned 18. These are mostly contained in your juvenile court file, but may also be kept by other agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ), the county Probation Department, police, sheriff, or other law enforcement agencies, and the District Attorney.<sup><a href="#footnote-3031" id="footnote-ref-3031">[3031]</a></sup> Your record also includes any documents or records made by these other agencies. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153971"></a>Who can see my juvenile record?</h3>
                <p class="text">Under the law, juvenile court and police records are usually confidential and NOT visible to the public or other people, except in certain cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-3032" id="footnote-ref-3032">[3032]</a></sup> Also, juvenile cases are considered “adjudications”—NOT “convictions”—so legally, you can say that you have NO convictions from your juvenile cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-3033" id="footnote-ref-3033">[3033]</a></sup>However, juvenile records sometimes DO show up on background checks, and certain employers such as law enforcement and health care agencies are allowed to ask about unsealed juvenile records.<sup><a href="#footnote-3034" id="footnote-ref-3034">[3034]</a></sup>  BUT once your juvenile record is sealed, NO one can see it. All juvenile records kept by the court, DOJ, probation department, and other law enforcement agencies are sealed, and it’s as if your case never happened.<sup><a href="#footnote-3035" id="footnote-ref-3035">[3035]</a></sup></p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">“Convictions as an adult”:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">A conviction as an adult means you were charged <em>as an adult</em> in criminal court (NOT in juvenile court) and convicted (either by plea bargain or trial).</p>

                <p class="text">Like everything else, it depends. You must meet 5 basic criteria in order to get your juvenile record sealed:<sup><a href="#footnote-3036" id="footnote-ref-3036">[3036]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You are over 18 years old</strong>, <strong>OR it has been 5 years</strong> <strong>since you were last arrested or completed your juvenile probation (whichever is later);You do NOT have any convictions <em>as an adult</em> for a</strong> <strong>felony</strong> <strong>OR for a misdemeanor involving “moral turpitude.”</strong> <strong>(“Moral turpitude” means the offense involved <em>dishonest or immoral behavior</em>,<sup><a href="#footnote-3037" id="footnote-ref-3037">[3037]</a></sup> such as <em>theft</em></strong>, <strong><em>fraud</em></strong>, <strong><em>certain</em></strong> <strong><em>sex</em></strong> <strong>and <em>drug</em></strong> <strong>offenses, and offenses causing <em>significant bodily injury</em>); Your case <em>started</em> and <em>ended</em> in juvenile court</strong> <strong>(not in some other court, such as probate court or adult criminal court);You can demonstrate (and convince the judge) that you have been rehabilitated</strong>; <strong>ANDThere is NO open <em>civil</em> lawsuit</strong> <strong>based on your juvenile offense.</strong></p>

                <p class="text">To get your juvenile record sealed, you will need to file a request (called a Petition to Seal Juvenile Records) in the juvenile court where your case was adjudicated. You will have a hearing where the judge will review your petition and ask for a recommendation from the probation department. You will need to answer any questions the judge has, and you can bring people to testify on your behalf. The judge will then decide whether or not to grant your request. If the judge decides to seal you record, s/he will also order all other agencies that have juvenile records on you to seal their records as well. If the judge does not decide to seal your record, you are allowed to refile your petition (the judge will tell you when).

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153976"></a>What types of federal expungement are available, and how could they help me?</h3>
                <p class="text">Convictions for federal offenses (meaning violations of U.S. law) often have broader consequences <em>beyond</em> California law. Federal convictions can cause some people to become ineligible for government-assisted housing,<sup><a href="#footnote-3040" id="footnote-ref-3040">[3040]</a></sup> federal student loans,<sup><a href="#footnote-3041" id="footnote-ref-3041">[3041]</a></sup> and <em>prohibit</em> you from participating in foster care or adoption programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-3042" id="footnote-ref-3042">[3042]</a></sup> so getting them expunged can benefit you in reapplying to these programs.</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Federal expungement &amp; dismissal:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">A <strong>federal expungement</strong> is different than an expungement under California law. Federal law allows for complete expungement of your conviction. The entire record of your conviction is completely erased along with any information associated with it. The offense is removed from your criminal record as if it never happened. This only applies in very limited situations, but it is a true expungement (see Situation 1). A <strong>federal dismissal</strong> is more like a California expungement, in that the conviction is NOT completely erased from your record, but it is still hidden from public view (see Situation 2).</p>
                <p class="text">Unfortunately, most federal convictions <em>cannot be expunged or dismissed</em>. Unlike in California (and most other states), there is NO general federal law that offers expungements for federal convictions. However, there are a few federal laws that offer expungements<strong> </strong>and dismissals<strong> i</strong>n certain limited situations.There are only a few options for cleaning up federal convictions on your criminal record:</p>
                <ol class="text">If your federal conviction is for certain drug offenses and you were <em>UNDER</em> 21 when you committed the offense, you may be eligible for a federal expungement.<em> (See Situation 1, below.)</em>If your federal conviction is for certain drug offenses and you were <em>OVER</em> 21 when you committed the offense, you may be eligible for a federal <em>dismissal</em>, but not an expungement.<em> (See Situation 2, below).</em>It is<em> possible</em> but <em>very difficult</em> to get your conviction expunged by a federal judge (this is called a <em>judicial expungement</em>). However, this is very rare, and depends on which federal court you were convicted in. <em>(See Situation 3, below).</em></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153977"></a>Who can get a federal expungement or dismissal? </h3>
                <p class="text">If you have a federal drug conviction (<em>Situation 1 or 2, below</em>), you may qualify for an expungement or dismissal of your conviction if ALL of the following are true:</p>
                <ol class="text">You were convicted of only one drug-related offense. You are NOT eligible if you have <em>any</em> other drug-related convictions (state or federal), OR if you have had any previous drug convictions expunged under the statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-3043" id="footnote-ref-3043">[3043]</a></sup>You were in possession of only <em>certain</em> types of drugs. The federal expungement statute ONLY covers convictions for marijuana, cocaine and cocaine-based substances, heroine, and methamphetamines (along with a few other less common drugs). To be eligible, your conviction must have involved one of these drugs (NOT any other drug).<sup><a href="#footnote-3044" id="footnote-ref-3044">[3044]</a></sup> You were convicted of “simple possession” only. You are NOT eligible if your conviction was for <em>any other offense</em> besides possession of a small amount of drugs consistent with personal use. This means no sales, transportation, or distribution offenses will qualify.<sup><a href="#footnote-3045" id="footnote-ref-3045">[3045]</a></sup> The judge “suspended” entry of judgment of conviction for the offense. This means that you were found guilty of the offense, but the judge basically put your conviction <em>on hold</em>, and did not enter it into the official record. (This is to give you a chance to complete probation or a treatment program instead of going to prison.);The judge put you on probation for <em>no more than 1 year</em>; ANDYou successfully completed probation with NO violations.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153978"></a>I meet all of the requirements for federal expungement. What are my next steps for pursuing the expungement?</h3>
                <h4>Situation 1: If you were under 21 at the time of the drug offense.</h4>
                <p class="text">When your probation term ends, you can ask the judge to expunge your conviction. If you have successfully completed your probation with NO violations, and you meet all the other requirements, the judge is <em>required</em> to grant your expungement. This means that ALL <em>official records</em> of your conviction, all references to your <em>arrest</em>, and the results of any <em>criminal proceedings</em> against you will be destroyed. You will get back any rights that you lost because of your conviction, and you can say that you have never been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted of the offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-3046" id="footnote-ref-3046">[3046]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4>Situation 2: If you were over 21 at the time of the drug offense. </h4>
                <p class="text">If you were <em>over</em> the age of 21 at the time of your offense, your conviction will not be completely expunged (i.e. erased). However, if you <em>successfully complete your probation</em> with NO violations, and you meet all the other requirements described above, the judge is <em>required</em> to dismiss your conviction at the end of your probation term. You can also ask the judge to dismiss your conviction and release you from probation early (before the end of your probation), but it will be up to the judge whether or not to grant this early. Once your conviction is dismissed, the record will be sealed—meaning the record will still exist, but it will NOT be public, and it will NOT show on your criminal record that you were ever convicted of the offense. You will also get back any rights that you lost because of your conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3047" id="footnote-ref-3047">[3047]</a></sup></p>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your conviction is expunged (Situation 1) or dismissed (Situation 2), the U.S. Department of Justice will keep a confidential, non-public record of your conviction in case you try to get another conviction expunged or dismissed in the future. Remember: You can only get a federal expungement <em>once in a lifetime!</em><sup><a href="#footnote-3048" id="footnote-ref-3048">[3048]</a></sup></p>
                <h4><a id="Expung_Part9_FedJudicialExpungement"></a>Is there any other way to get my federal conviction expunged? (Situation 3)</h4>
                <p class="text">Maybe. It is sometimes possible to convince a federal judge to ORDER that your conviction be expunged. This is called a “judicial expungement.” However, judicial expungements <em>are VERY, VERY rare—and some courts won’t do them at all.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-3049" id="footnote-ref-3049">[3049]</a></sup> Many federal courts only grant judicial expungements when it is <em>necessary</em> to correct an error in a criminal case that amounts to a violation of your basic rights (i.e. a “<em>miscarriage of justice</em>”). In these courts your only chance of being granted a judicial expungement is if your conviction was the result of illegal or invalid conduct by the government, such as an unlawful arrest, an unconstitutional law, or a gross administrative error.<sup><a href="#footnote-3050" id="footnote-ref-3050">[3050]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">The federal courts in California follow this rule—so if your federal conviction happened in <em>California</em>, you will need to show that your conviction was caused by a “<em>miscarriage of justice</em>,” otherwise the judge will NOT grant you a judicial expungement.<sup><a href="#footnote-3051" id="footnote-ref-3051">[3051]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">Other federal courts will grant a judicial expungement only under specific and extraordinary circumstances, when they determine that it is necessary in all fairness.<sup><a href="#footnote-3052" id="footnote-ref-3052">[3052]</a></sup> These courts balance the harm that you suffer because of your criminal record (for example, if you are denied public housing or benefits, you cannot be with your family, or you are disqualified from certain jobs), against the public’s interest in preserving the record of your conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3053" id="footnote-ref-3053">[3053]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">If your federal conviction is from a state where the federal courts allow the judge to balance the factors of your situation, you will still have to convince the judge that the expungement is <em>necessary to preserve your basic rights</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-3054" id="footnote-ref-3054">[3054]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h4>The Bottom Line:</h4>
                <p class="text">The only circumstances under which you are likely to get a judicial expungement of your federal conviction are: </p>
                <ol class="text">When your conviction is based on a law that was later found to be unconstitutional; <em>or </em>If a judge finds that your conviction was the result of police or government misconduct. </ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Who gets Presidential Pardons?</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Here are some <em>examples</em> of people who have received a Presidential Pardon:</p>
                <ul class="sidebox">Former President Richard NixonGeorge Steinbrenner (former owner of the New York Yankees)Roger Clinton, Jr. (half-brother of former President Bill Clinton)Marc Richard (billionaire businessman)Jimmy Hoffa (former union leader)Patty Hearst</ul>
                <p class="text">If you want to request a judicial expungement of your federal conviction, it is recommended that you talk to a lawyer. You can contact the lawyer who represented you in your criminal case or a federal public defender.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153980"></a>Who can get a presidential pardon of a federal conviction?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. Presidential pardons are <em>even more difficult</em> to get than federal judicial expungements (see PG. 1093). U.S. Presidential Pardons are generally only given in high-profile, highly public cases—for example, to certain public figures or politicians, or to friends and relatives of the President.Technically, any federal conviction is eligible for a presidential pardon, but you must first complete your sentence (including any parole or probation term) AND a 5-year waiting period before you can request a Pardon. The 5-year waiting period starts when you are released from custody, or from the date of your conviction if you were never incarcerated (whichever is later).<sup><a href="#footnote-3055" id="footnote-ref-3055">[3055]</a></sup> During this time, you will need to show that you have led a responsible and productive life, made significant efforts toward rehabilitation, and taken responsibility for your offense. In deciding whether to grant your pardon, the President will consider the following factors, so you should emphasize your efforts and accomplishments in these areas:</p>
                <ol class="text">Employment, including stable work and financial situation;Family responsibility;Community service, volunteer work, or other charitable activities;Reputation in the community;Military service (if applicable);Any other accomplishments; ANDYour efforts to take responsibility for your offense and make restitution to any victims.<sup><a href="#footnote-3056" id="footnote-ref-3056">[3056]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">Here are some other things you should include or mention:</p>
                <ol class="text">Letters of support, reports, and recommendations—particularly official reports or recommendations from people involved in your criminal case, such as the judge, the prosecutor, or your federal probation officer.Any hardships caused by your conviction—for example, if your conviction is preventing you from getting certain jobs or professional licenses; or making it difficult for you to reunite with your children and family; or if you cannot get certain public benefits, public housing, loans, or other services because of your conviction.The amount of time that has passed since your conviction—The more serious your offense, the more time you will need to put between your conviction and your request in order to demonstrate your rehabilitation and convince the president that you deserve a pardon.<sup><a href="#footnote-3057" id="footnote-ref-3057">[3057]</a></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Remember:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">You must complete your sentence (including any probation, parole, or supervision) AND a 5-year waiting period before you can request a pardon.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153981"></a>How do I go about applying for a presidential pardon?</h3>
                <p class="text">To apply for a presidential pardon, you must complete a “Petition for Executive Clemency” and file it with the Office of the Pardon Lawyer within the U.S. Department of Justice.

To find a public Live Scan location near you, check your local yellow pages, or visit the DOJ website at: https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations. The fees and hours vary from site to site (and change often), and some sites require appointments whereas others allow walk-ins. For this reason, it is always recommended that you call the site you want to visit <em>beforehand</em> to make sure you they’re open and know how much it costs.

                <p class="normal1"><strong>Fee waivers: If you cannot afford the $25 fee…</strong></p>
                <p class="text">If you cannot afford the $25 fee, you can request a “fee waiver”—meaning you will NOT have to pay to get your RAP sheet. To request a fee waiver, you can fill out an “Application for Fee Waiver” form or attach a separate letter that requests a waiver of the fee (see a sample fee waiver letter in Appendix C, on PG. 1107). You will need to give a reason why you can’t afford the fee—for example, you receive public benefits (such as CalWORKS, CalFRESH (food stamps), MediCal, or unemployment insurance); or your expenses (such as rent, utilities, food and medicine, child support, and other bills) are more than you earn. If possible, you may want to send copies (not the originals!) of your pay stubs, bank account records, or other documents showing your income and expenses. If you do not receive the request after 2 weeks, call the DOJ at (916) 227-3835 to make sure that your documents are being processed. Leave your full name and a telephone number in their voicemail so they can return your call</p>
                <h5 class="question">How long will I have to wait for my California RAP sheet?</h5>
                <p class="text">Once you send in your forms, it can take up to <em>2 months</em> (anywhere from 1—8 weeks) to get a copy of your California (DOJ) RAP sheet, depending on how long your RAP sheet is (i.e., how much information it contains). If your RAP sheet is fairly long (in other words, if you have had many encounters with law enforcement and/or the criminal justice system), it takes longer for the DOJ to process your request, because they have to research and verify all of the information.<sup><a href="#footnote-3086" id="footnote-ref-3086">[3086]</a></sup></p>

Follow the prompts that ask you if you want to “verify or challenge the accuracy of your criminal history” or “check the status of a previously submitted request.” If you are asked to leave a message, make sure that your information is clear so that the right person can call you back.</p>

                <p class="text">When you received your RAP sheet, you should have also received a form called a “<em>Claim of Alleged Inaccuracy or Incompleteness</em>” (DOJ form BCIA 8706). This is the form you must fill out to challenge information in your state RAP sheet. If you do not have this form for any reason, you must contact the Department of Justice to request another copy. This form is not available online, or from any source other than the DOJ. If you cannot get the form, you can send a letter to the DOJ instead.<sup><a href="#footnote-3094" id="footnote-ref-3094">[3094]</a></sup> </p>

                <p class="text">Fill out the “<em>Claim of Alleged Inaccuracy or Incompleteness</em>” form, or write your letter. Whether you are filling out the form or writing a letter, you need to explain, as specifically as possible, what the error is—<em>why</em> and <em>how</em> your record is inaccurate or incomplete. Examples of common errors include:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3095" id="footnote-ref-3095">[3095]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text"><strong>Mismatched names</strong><em>. </em>If your RAP sheet contains arrests, convictions, or other information that is unrelated to your past, your name may have been confused with another person’s name.<strong>Leaving out important information about a case</strong><em>. </em>Sometimes, even if a case against you has been resolved, your RAP sheet may not reflect the updated information. For example, if you were found innocent of the charges, but your RAP still says, “case pending.” <strong>Revealing sealed information</strong><em>. </em>Your RAP may contain records that should have been destroyed or can only be released by special court order, such as sealed arrests or juvenile offenses.<strong>Providing misleading information</strong><em>. </em>It is possible that a single charge may appear multiple times on your RAP, making it look like you are a multiple offender.<strong>Misclassifying your offenses</strong><em>. </em>If a misdemeanor conviction shows up as a felony on your RAP sheet, this is a serious problem!</ol>

                <p class="text">NOTE: The DOJ assumes that its records are correct. When the DOJ looks into a challenge like this, it often simply checks its version of your record against the copy of your RAP sheet that it sent you.

                <p class="text">In California, if you want to challenge information found in your background check, these are the steps you will need to take:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3101" id="footnote-ref-3101">[3101]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <h4 class="step">CHALLENGE the background check company’s incorrect information.</h4>
                <p class="text">You must notify the background check company that ran your background check that there was a mistake in the information included in your background check report.</p>
                <ol class="text">Send the background check company a letter to notify them in writing that you are disputing (challenging) the information in your background check. (A <em>sample</em> challenge letter is included in APPENDIX I, on PG. 1118.)You should explain <em>why</em> the information is incorrect, and include any <em>proof</em> (documents, facts, and other evidence) to support your claim. Make <em>copies</em> of important documents and include them with your letter.You can find the name and address of the background check company in 2 places:BEFORE someone runs a background check on you (such as an employer, private landlord, or creditor), they are supposed to tell you and get your PERMISSION. They must also give you the name, address, phone number, and website of the background check company that they are going to use.<sup><a href="#footnote-3102" id="footnote-ref-3102">[3102]</a></sup>If someone takes any <em>negative</em> action against you (such as refusing to hire you, rent an apartment to you, or give you benefits) based on information in your background check, they must give you an “ADVERSE ACTION LETTER” that also includes the name, address, and phone number of the background check company that did the background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-3103" id="footnote-ref-3103">[3103]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="step">The background check company INVESTIGATES your claim. </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">You have the right to know what internal procedures the background company uses to investigate your claim. You can ask the company for this information and they MUST provide it to you. </p>
                <p class="text">Once the company receives your letter, it MUST investigate your claim <em>free</em> <em>of</em> <em>charge.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-3104" id="footnote-ref-3104">[3104]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">During the investigation, the company MUST review ALL the evidence you sent in and consider any relevant information.The company must notify whoever provided the information that you are challenging it.<sup><a href="#footnote-3105" id="footnote-ref-3105">[3105]</a></sup>Based on its investigation, the company MUST <em>update</em>, <em>confirm</em>, or <em>remove</em> the challenged <em>within</em> <em>30 days</em> (see Step 3 for more information).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3106" id="footnote-ref-3106">[3106]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="step">AFTER the background check company finishes its investigation…</h4>
                <p class="text">The background check company will make a decision about the information you challenged, and must respond to you within 30 days. If you give the company more information that affects the investigation during the 30-day period, the agency can extend the investigation for an extra 15 days. Based on its investigation, the company MUST:</p>
                <ol class="text">Correct or remove any information that is inaccurate, incomplete, or can’t be confirmed as true;Notify the person or agency that provided the information that it has been corrected or removed from your background check;Keep in any information that the company confirms is complete and accurate;End the investigation (without making any changes) if the company finds that your claim is “<em>frivolous”</em> or “<em>irrelevant</em>.” This usually means that you have not provided enough information for the company to investigate your claim. If the company ends the investigation, it must notify you, explain the reasons for its decision, AND tell you what information it needs in order to continue the investigation.<sup><a href="#footnote-3107" id="footnote-ref-3107">[3107]</a></sup>Notify you when the investigation is complete, tell you the results of the investigation, AND send you a new copy of your background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-3108" id="footnote-ref-3108">[3108]</a></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="step">FOLLOW UP after the background check company’s decision!</h4>
                <ol class="text">If the background check company DOESN’T remove the information, or if there is still information in your background check that you think is incorrect or incomplete, you can add a STATEMENT OF DISPUTE saying that you disagree with the information in your file.<sup><a href="#footnote-3109" id="footnote-ref-3109">[3109]</a></sup> Mail this statement to the background check company, and tell them to include it in your file. (See APPENDIX J, on PG. 1119 for a <em>sample</em> statement of dispute.)The company MUST include your statement of dispute in any future background checks it runs AND clearly state that the information is “in dispute” (being challenged as incorrect).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3110" id="footnote-ref-3110">[3110]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="step">NOTIFY anyone who has received a copy of your background check.</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If an employer, private landlord, government agency, or anyone else ran a background check on you within the past 2 years that contained information that you believe was wrong or incomplete, you should make sure to have the background check company notify them that the information is wrong or is in dispute.</p>
                <p class="text">If the agency corrects or removes any information in your background check, or if you add a statement of dispute to your file, you should ask the background check company to send a notice of the change to ANYONE who received your background check in the last <em>2 years</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-3111" id="footnote-ref-3111">[3111]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4 class="step">If the background check company later puts information BACK into your background check that it previously removed…</h4>
                <p class="text">If a background check company REMOVES challenged information from your background check, it can REINSERT (put back) the information if the company later finds that the information is true. </p>
                <ol class="text">If this happens, the background check company MUST: Notify you the information has been put back in your file; Give you the name, address, and phone number of anyone the company <em>talked to</em> when deciding to put the information back in; ANDGive you the phone number of the person or agency that <em>provided the information</em> that the company put back in.<sup><a href="#footnote-3112" id="footnote-ref-3112">[3112]</a></sup>You also have the right to challenge any information the company puts back into your background check. You have can ask the background check company to re-investigate any information that it has <em>put back</em> in your background check. The company must conduct <em>another</em> investigation of the information, tell you the results, make any corrections, and give you a new copy of your background check report (just like in STEPS 2-3).</ol>
                <p class="textbox"><strong><em>Why would a background check company PUT BACK information that it previously removed?</em></strong>Sometimes a background check company will REMOVE information from your background check—for example, because it could not confirm that the information was true—but later, the company will find out that the information was true and PUT IT BACK on your background check report to make the report complete.</p>

                <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppK"></a>Petition for Dismissal (California Expungement) </div>
                <p class="text">In most cases, you will need to file papers in court and ask a judge to expunge your conviction. This process is called a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>. The process is almost the same for requesting mandatory or discretionary dismissal, but there are a few small differences. Remember, it is always good to ask a lawyer for assistance, especially if you are requesting discretionary dismissal.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Get the court forms you will need to request an expungement from the court: the Petition for Dismissal (form CR-180) and the Order for Dismissal (form CR-181)</h4>
                <h4 class="sidebox">The court clerk:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">The court clerk is the person who oversees all of the court’s records, legal documents, and administration. Some courts may have a separate clerk for each department of the court (e.g., criminal court, traffic court, probate court, etc.). If this is the case, you will need to get help from the <em>criminal</em> court clerk. Usually, the clerk will have a separate office, counter, or window at the courthouse. When you go to the courthouse, ask someone where the clerk’s office is if you can’t find it.</p>
                <ol class="text">The “<em>Petition for Dismissal</em>” (form CR-180) is the formal document you use to ask the court to expunge your conviction. If the judge approves your expungement, s/he will sign the “<em>Order for Dismissal</em>” (form CR-181) to make your expungement an <em>official</em> court order.You can get these forms from several places, including. The Clerk of the court where you were convicted;The California Courts’ official website (<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr180.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr180.pdf</a>); orFrom your lawyer. A sample form CR-180 and form CR-181 are included in APPENDIX DD, on PG. 1163 for reference. BUT it is always better to <em>get the most current version from an official source</em>, in case there have been any recent changes to the form.</ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have convictions from multiple cases, you will need to file a separate petition for each <em>case</em>.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Fill out your court forms (Petition AND Order)<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3113" id="footnote-ref-3113">[3113]</a></sup></sup></strong></h4>
                <p class="text">Here are some tips for filling out the forms:</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Petition </span><em>—</em>Fill in ALL the information that the forms ask for. You will need the information from your RAP sheet (or court records from all of your cases) in order to fill out the forms.<span class="emphasisitalic">Petition question #1</span><em>—</em>If you are filing a petition to have a felony “wobbler” expunged, you will need to mark “Yes” in the box that asks if the felony is eligible for reduction to a misdemeanor under Penal Code Section 17(b). (See PG. 1071 for more information about expungement of felony “wobblers.”) <span class="emphasisitalic">Bottom of Petition</span> —If your sentence included probation, check the box for “1203.4.” If your sentence did NOT include probation, check the box for “1203.4a.” If you were convicted of a felony under California’s Realignment Act, check the box for “1203.41.” (See PG. 1060 for more information about expungement of felonies that were sentenced under Realignment.) <span class="emphasisitalic">Bottom of Petition</span>—Don’t forget to sign the form and put the date!<span class="emphasisitalic">Order</span><em>—</em>Only fill out the top boxes (for “<em>Lawyer or Party Without Lawyer</em>,” “<em>People of the State of California v. Defendant</em>,” and “<em>Case Number</em>”), and leave the rest of the form blank (all of the numbered questions). Make sure the information is the same as the top boxes on the <em>Petition</em> form! The judge will fill in all the other information after deciding whether or not to grant your expungement.<span class="emphasisitalic">Petition AND Order</span><em>—</em>If you are filling out the forms for yourself, you are BOTH the “<em>petitioner” </em>AND the “<em>defendant</em>,” so you should fill in your information wherever you see these terms. If your conviction qualifies for <em>mandatory</em> dismissal, you only need to fill out the Petition (CR-180) and Order (CR-181) forms. However, if your conviction only qualifies for <em>discretionary</em> dismissal, you will need to include a few more documents <em>in addition</em> to your petition. (See PG. 1061 for more information on the difference between mandatory and discretionary expungement, and to figure out which type of expungement you qualify for.) </ol>
                <p class="text">FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPUNGEMENT, GO TO STEP 3. FOR MANDATORY EXPUNGEMENT, SKIP TO STEP 4.</p>
                <h4 class="step"> (FOR DISCRETIONARY PETITIONS ONLY) Gather additional supporting documents to include with your Petition. </h4>
                <p class="text">If you are requesting a discretionary dismissal, you will also need to include the following documents. (<em>Note</em>: Make a photocopy of any documents you send with your petition, and keep the original for yourself!)</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">A Declaration</span>. A declaration is a statement that you write under penalty of perjury, that explains why expungement of your conviction is “<em>in the interests of justice</em>.” Your declaration should say why you deserve to get an expungement, and how it will help you succeed in the future:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3114" id="footnote-ref-3114">[3114]</a></sup></sup>How have you changed since your conviction? What was going on in your life at the time of the conviction? What has changed in your life since then?What efforts have you made toward rehabilitation? What are you doing to improve yourself and your situation (such as treatment programs, work or school, connecting with family, finding religion)?What are your goals for the future (for example, getting a job or promotion, getting your GED or a college degree, connecting with family, starting a business)?How will getting an expungement help you to achieve your goals?You can use the official Declaration form (MC-031) published by the Judicial Council of California which is available from the court clerk, or on the California Courts website at: <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc031.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc031.pdf</a>. For tips for what to write in your Declaration, see APPENDIX L, on PG. 1124. For a <em>sample Declaration</em>, see APPENDIX M, on PG. 1125.<span class="emphasisitalic">Letters of Support</span>. Letters of support serve as character references and emphasize the positive impact that granting your dismissal will have. You should ask for letters from people who know you well, and who can talk about your positive qualities, your accomplishments, and your rehabilitation efforts. These can be from your rabbi, priest, or pastor; your employer (current or previous); your teachers; your sponsor or mentor; your counselor or case manager; community leaders and other members of community organizations that you are involved in; and your friends, family, and neighbors. When you ask someone for a letter of support, you can remind them of your accomplishments and explain what you would like them to write about (for example, how you have changed since your conviction, your efforts at rehabilitation, your good character, your efforts to improve yourself and help others around you, and why you deserve to have your conviction expunged). For more information on how to write a Letter of Support and tips for what to write, see APPENDIX N, on PG. 1126. A <em>sample Letter of Support </em>is included in APPENDIX O, on PG. 1128.<span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Accomplishments</span>. If you have completed any classes or training programs since your conviction (such as vocational training or job readiness programs; GED classes, or other schooling; mentorship courses, reentry programs, restorative justice workshops, or any other treatment programs), or if you have earned any certificates, awards, or degrees, or if there are any other accomplishments that you’re proud of, you should make sure to include this information with your petition! This can be anything you accomplished <em>while you were incarcerated</em> or <em>since you’ve been released</em>. (<em>Note</em>: Make a photocopy of any documents you send with your petition, and keep the originals for yourself!) <span class="emphasisitalic">Letter to Request a Hearing</span>. If you are asking for a discretionary expungement, you should ALWAYS ask for a <em>hearing</em> in front of a judge, so that you have the best chance to convince him/her to grant your request. To ask for a hearing, write a very brief letter saying that you would like to request a hearing on your Petition for Dismissal. Make sure to include your name and case number, and address your letter to “The Honorable Judge” (with the judge’s name, if you know it). Turn in this letter with your <em>Petition</em> and other documents.<span class="emphasisitalic">Other Documents</span>:<em> </em>Each court may have local rules about what additional documents you can include with your petition and what documents you should bring to the hearing. Check with the court clerk about what to do with any other documents that you would like the judge to consider.</ol>
                <h4 class="step">Make copies of your petition and supporting documents.</h4>
                <p class="text">After you have filled out your petition and attached your supporting documents, you will need to make several copies of everything. Ask the court clerk how many copies are required by the court in your county. If you can’t talk to the clerk, make at least five copies to be safe. Generally, the original petition goes in the court’s file (the “docket”), one copy goes to the District Attorney, one copy goes to the probation department, and one “courtesy” copy is saved for the judge (if he or she wants one). But these procedures may vary by county, so it’s important to ask the clerk how many copies you need to make.</p>
                <h4 class="step"> “Serve” the Court Papers</h4>
                <p class="normal1"><strong><em>What is “service” and how do I do it?</em></strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3115" id="footnote-ref-3115">[3115]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <p class="text">Service is the formal process of giving copies of the documents in a court case to the other people connected with the case. It is a very important step because it lets the other people know 1) that your court case exists, and 2) what actions have been taken in the case so far. A case CANNOT go forward until the court documents are properly served (delivered). The most common methods of service are in person or by mail, although in come situations, service can be by fax or email also.In general, for an expungement petition, your papers have to be served on the <em>District Attorney</em> and the <em>county probation department</em>. Ask the court clerk whether there is <em>anyone else </em>who needs to get the papers also.</p>
                <h4 class="step">File Your Petition and “Proof of Service” with the Court Clerk.</h4>
                <ol class="text">After your papers have been “served” on all of the other parties, bring the following documents to the court clerk: Your<em> original</em> <em>Petition</em>; your additional supporting documents (if you are requesting a discretionary dismissal); one set of copies for your records; AND the Proof of Service for your Petition. The clerk will stamp your papers with the date and give you a stamped copy. Remember, the court clerk will usually have an office or counter at the courthouse, so that’s where you will need to go to file your papers.The clerk may or may not give you a court date for a hearing before a judge. FOR MANDATORY EXPUNGEMENTS: In some counties, mandatory expungements are granted without any hearing on your Petition. Other counties require a formal hearing before an expungement is granted. FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPUNGEMENTS: If you are requesting a discretionary expungement, you should ALWAYS ask for a <em>hearing</em> before a judge, so that you have the best chance to convince him/her to grant your expungement. Tell the court clerk that you would like to request a hearing and show him/her your letter requesting a hearing, which you should include with your other documents. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Go to Your Court Date/Hearing </h4>
                <ol class="text">If you are given a hearing date to have your petition heard by a judge, you or your lawyer MUST go to court for the hearing. FOR MANDATORY EXPUNGEMENTS: If you qualify for a mandatory expungement, the judge will grant your petition, and dismiss your case. You should not have to do anything if there is a hearing. You should receive something in the mail from the court within a few weeks confirming that your record has been officially changed. FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPUNGEMENTS: If you are requesting a discretionary dismissal, the hearing is your chance to explain your case to the judge and persuade him or her that dismissing your conviction is “in the interests of justice.” You will need to show the judge why you deserve to have your conviction expunged, and how an expungement will help you succeed and achieve your goals.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3116" id="footnote-ref-3116">[3116]</a></sup></sup> You should be prepared to explain the information in your Declaration and in any supporting documents that you included with your Petition. Make sure you bring extra copies of these documents to the hearing! In general, the judge will tell you <em>right there at the hearing</em> whether or not your expungement is granted.</ol>
                <h4 class="step">Follow up!</h4>
                <ol class="text">After the judge grants your expungement and signs the Order making it official, the court will send the information to the Department of Justice and other law enforcement agencies. It may take a few months for these agencies to correct your official criminal record (RAP sheet) to show that your conviction was expunged. You should follow up with the Department of Justice in 3-4 months to confirm that the changes were made. Remember, expungement does NOT erase the conviction from your criminal record. Instead, your RAP sheet will state that your case has been “<em>dismissed [in] furtherance of justice (DISM, FURTH OF JUST)</em>” OR “<em>dismissed pursuant to PC 1203.4</em>.”If the DOJ has NOT corrected your record after several months, you may need to ask them to do so by filing a “Claim of Alleged Inaccuracy or Incompleteness” (form BCIA 8706). The process for challenging and correcting information in your RAP sheet is detailed in APPENDIX F, on PG. 1112. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">If your petition is denied, re-file it</h4>
                <p class="text">If your petition for expungement is denied, you are allowed to file it again (“re-file”). At the end of your hearing, ask the judge to explain the reason why s/he did not grant your request for an expungement, so that you can take steps to fix the problem before you re-file your Petition. If you forget to ask or cannot get this information from the judge for some reason, try calling the court clerk to see if he or she can help you figure out what to do to make sure your Petition is granted the next time.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3117" id="footnote-ref-3117">[3117]</a></sup></sup> </p>

                <p class="text">The declaration is your chance to present evidence to convince the judge that you deserve an expungement. Here are some tips for writing your declaration:<sup><a href="#footnote-3118" id="footnote-ref-3118">[3118]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">First, explain the basic information about your conviction and sentence. Tell the judge why your conviction meets the requirements for discretionary expungement (see PG. 1062 for a list of requirements).Next, explain why granting your expungement would be “in the interest of justice”—meaning why you deserve to have your conviction expunged, and how the expungement will help you succeed in the future. Here are some examples of things you may want to talk about (but only if they are true for your situation!):If there were circumstances that made your life especially difficult at time of your conviction;How you are turning your life around;Your work and/or school history (including any vocational training, GED or other classes, and other programs you’ve participated in);Current opportunities for work, school, and other activities to enrich your life, and how expungement will help you take advantage of these opportunities;Your family situation and needs, and how an expungement will help you reconnect with, support, or otherwise benefit your family; andAny problems you have had completing probation, and what you are doing to address those problems. You should be specific and honest, and include as many details as possible to give the judge a concrete picture of what happened. But you should not include irrelevant or unnecessary information that might distract him/her. Finally, it is recommended that you ask a lawyer to look over your declaration before you turn it in, if possible.</ol>

                <p>I, NAME, declare:</p>
                <p>I believe the following facts justify my petition for expungement:</p>
                <p>1. I was convicted of violating California Penal Code, (describe offense), committed on DATE. (Briefly describe circumstances of cases)</p>
                <p>2. (Describe life circumstances at time of conviction, e.g.: In 1997, after this conviction for possession of methamphetamines, I was literally “scared straight. I realized that I needed to change my life entirely; I decided to get clean. Although it was difficult, I stopped doing drugs on my own.)</p>
                <p>3. (Describe life circumstances since incident/conviction, e.g.: I have not had alcohol for over 10 years. I have not done any drugs for five years. Over the past year, I have participated in Alcoholics Anonymous to get support for staying “clean and sober,” and in order to get my drivers license back to help with finding</p>
                <p>and retaining a job. I am in the process of joining a labor union of cement masons in order to find work. I am living at a shelter until I can find employment.)</p>
                <p>4. (Describe/explain any other contacts with law enforcement since the incident/conviction, e.g. since the 1997 convictions, I have had one contact with law enforcement. I was cited and released for driving on a suspended license. Currently, I am working with the DMV and the courts to get my drivers license</p>
                <p>back and clear this violation from my record.)</p>
                <p>5. (Describe why you need an expungement, e.g., my prior conviction is greatly limiting my job opportunities and an expungement would allow me to work and achieve my goal of self- sufficiency and continued sobriety. I respectfully request that the court use its discretion to expunge my misdemeanor conviction and grant me a second chance to work and support myself. I declare under penalty of perjury of the laws of the State of California that the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.</p>

                <h4>HERE ARE SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES ON ASKING FOR LETTERS OF SUPPORT. </h4>
                <div class="textstrongemphasis">General Reminders:</div>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Make it as easy for people as possible!</span> People are busy and letters of support can take time to write. Some ways you can make it easier for the people you are asking to help you are:<span class="emphasisitalic">Give them plenty of time.</span> Don’t ask them 2 days before you need to turn in the letter. Give them plenty of time to work on it so they don’t feel rushed and can put thought into what they’re writing. <span class="emphasisitalic">Give them plenty of information</span>. Make sure to remind them of things they can write about, such as your accomplishments or your positive impact on them.<span class="emphasisitalic">Give them friendly reminders</span>. If someone hasn’t responded to you or hasn’t given you a letter by the date you asked to have it done by, try writing them a quick email or calling them. Be polite and not demanding. Your message should be along the lines of “I know you are busy, but I was curious if you will have any time to work on that letter of support I asked you about?” <span class="emphasisitalic">Have a variety of people write letters for you</span>. You should have letters from people who know as many different aspects of you as possible. Don’t get all of your letters from people who all know you from the same activity or area of your life. <span class="emphasisitalic">Keep it Short</span>. It is best to keep the letters short, about 1–2 pages. This will make them easier to read and also less time consuming to write. </ol>

                <p class="text">To request early release from probation, you will need to file a <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em> in the court where you were convicted. Because this process requires drafting a formal court pleading with accompanying documents, it is recommended that you ask a lawyer for help. Ideally, you should contact the lawyer who represented you when you were sentenced, but any private criminal defense lawyer or Public Defender should be able to help you.</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Need help with your court forms? </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Remember, it is recommended that you ask a lawyer to help you with your <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em>. But if you cannot get a lawyer or want to do it on your own, you can find helpful information on the California Courts website:</p>
                <ul class="sidebox">Cleaning up your record <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1070.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1070.htm</a>Understanding the basics of court forms <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1078.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1078.htm</a>.</ul>
                <p class="text">The process for filing a <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em> is as follows:</p>
                <h4 class="step">Write your Motion and Supporting Documents.</h4>
                <p class="text">There is no official court form for this motion, so you or your lawyer will have to write your own motion. Your motion will consist of these 5 parts:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3119" id="footnote-ref-3119">[3119]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Notice of Motion</span>—This tells the judge what you want to him or her to do. In other words, it tells the judge that you want to be released early from probation.<span class="emphasisitalic">Memorandum of Points and Authorities</span>—This section explains the law (California Penal Code section 1203.3(a)), the facts about your individual situation, and the evidence you have to justify your request for early release.<span class="emphasisitalic">Declaration</span>—This is your sworn statement that all the facts about your individual situation are true. Your <em>Declaration</em> must include ALL<em> </em>of the facts that you use to make your points in your <em>Memorandum</em> and all the information that you want to tell the judge to convince him or her to grant your request.<span class="emphasisitalic">Proposed Order</span>—This is the document the judge signs if s/he grants your early discharge and terminates your probation.<span class="emphasisitalic">Proof of Service</span>—You will need to give copies of your court papers to the other people involved in your case (generally the District Attorney and the probation department—ask the court clerk if there is anyone else). The Proof of Service proves that you gave copies to everyone who was supposed to get them.</ol>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Court fees:</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Be aware that the clerk will charge you fees for filing documents with the court. The amount of the fees will vary by county. If you cannot afford to pay the fees, you can request a <em>fee waiver</em> (meaning you do not have to pay the fees). Ask the clerk how much the fees are and how to request a fee waiver. </p>
                <h4 class="step">Make Copies &amp; File your Motion</h4>
                <ol class="text">Once your motion and other papers are all ready, make copies for everyone who will receive it. Check with the court clerk to see how many copies you will need. Generally, you will need one copy for the DA, one for the Probation Department, and one for your own records, but you should ask the clerk if there is anyone else. You may also want to make a courtesy copy for the judge. Bring the original motion and all copies to file with the clerk in the court where you were convicted. The clerk will file your Motion, keep the original copy for the court file, and give you back the copies you need for yourself and the other parties (DA, probation department, etc.). After you file your motion, the clerk will give you a court date for a hearing before a judge. Ask the clerk what room your hearing will be in. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Serve your court papers on the other parties</h4>
                <ol class="text">Service is the official process of giving copies of your court documents to other people connected with the case.Ask the court clerk whether you are responsible for serving your court papers, or whether the clerk will do it directly. If the clerk gives you back more than 1 copy when you file your court papers (see Step 3), this most likely means that you are responsible for service!If the clerk says that you are responsible for service, this means that you must make sure that all necessary parties (DA, probation department, and anyone else the clerk tells you) get a copy of your papers motion in the proper manner. If you are responsible for service, make sure to have your papers served on (delivered to) the DA <em>at least 2 days before</em> the court date for your hearing! The law requires you to give the DA at least 2 days notice of your Motion so he or she can prepare for the hearing as well.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3120" id="footnote-ref-3120">[3120]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Attend The Hearing</h4>
                <ol class="text">When you file your <em>Motion for Early Termination of Probation</em>, the clerk will give you a court date for your motion to be heard by a judge. You MUST go to court for the hearing on that date and time! At the hearing, you will explain to the judge all the reasons why releasing you from probation early is “in the interests of justice”—in other words, why you deserve to be released early from probation, and why being off probation will help you to achieve your goals and avoid further hardships. You should talk about all of the factors discussed above, including (1) your successful fulfillment of your probation requirements and satisfaction of all conditions; (2) your good conduct, efforts at rehabilitation, and other accomplishments (work, school, volunteer efforts, family responsibilities, etc.); (3) what you have learned and how you have changed since your offense; and (4) why staying on probation will cause you hardship (for example, preventing you from finding work, attending school, traveling to see your family, etc.).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3121" id="footnote-ref-3121">[3121]</a></sup></sup> If the judge grants you early release from probation or changes your probation in any other way, he or she must explain the reasons for doing so. Also, before the judge signs the Order to officially end your probation, s/he must first notify your probation officer.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3122" id="footnote-ref-3122">[3122]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Re-filing Your Motion</h4>
                <ol class="text">Remember, a decision to terminate your probation early is entirely up to the judge to decide. However, if the judge denies your motion, you can re-file it. Make sure you find out why the judge denied your request so that you can fix the problem before you re-file. If there is something the judge wants you to <em>include</em> with your motion next time, make sure you include it. If there is something the judge wants you to <em>do</em> before he or she is willing to grant your request, make sure you do it! Finally, although there is no limit to how often or how many times you can re-file, do not be a nuisance! The last thing you want to do it put the decision in the hands of an annoyed judge!</ol>

                <p class="normal1"><a id="Expung_Part3_ReducFelConvic_partExpunge"></a><strong>As Part of Your Expungement Petition:</strong></p>
                <p class="text">If you want to reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor AND get your conviction expunged, it is very easy to do both at the same time When you have your court hearing for your expungement, the judge will consider both requests—first your request to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, and then your request to have it expunged. If you meet all the requirements, usually the judge will grant both of your requests together. (For a list of the requirements for reducing a felony to a misdemeanor, see PG. 1068. For expungement requirements, see PG. 1058.)There are two main steps to this process: </p>
                <ol class="text">File Your Petition for Dismissal: The<em> Petition for Dismissal </em>(form CR-180) that you must file to get your conviction expunged has a box to check if your conviction is also eligible to be reduced. When you are filling out your <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, mark the box on question # 1 to show that the conviction is eligible for reduction under California Penal Code section 17(b). (For more information on getting and filling out form CR-180, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120.)File the petition in the county where you were convicted. The same petition now serves as both your request to have your conviction expunged AND your request to have it reduced to a misdemeanor. (For details on how to file a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1120.)Go to Your Court Hearing: When you have your court hearing, the judge will usually consider both requests at the same hearing—first your request to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, and then your request to have it expunged. At the hearing, the judge will consider the following: The nature of the offense;The facts of the case;Whether you fulfilled the conditions of your probation;Your full criminal record and personal conduct record;Any objections from the district attorney.</ol>
                <p class="text">Again, usually the judge will make a decision on both of your requests together. </p>
                <p class="normal1"><strong>As a Separate Petition:</strong></p>
                <p class="text">If the judge does NOT reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or if your felony is eligible for reduction but not expungement, you may need to file a separate petition to get it reduced. Your petition will need to show the judge that your felony conviction meets all the requirements to be reduced to a misdemeanor (see PG. 1068 for a list of these requirements), and explain why you deserve to have your conviction reduced. It will be entirely up to the judge to decide whether your conviction should be reduced. NOTE: This is a formal court document, not just a form you fill out, so it is recommended that you ask a lawyer to help you.Your petition will have of 3 parts: </p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">The Petition</span>—This is your formal request to the court explaining that you are asking to have your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor.<span class="emphasisitalic">The Memorandum of Points and Authorities</span>—This is where you state that your felony conviction meets all the requirements to be reduced to a misdemeanor under the law (California Penal Code section 17(b)(3)), and explain why you deserve to have your conviction reduced to a misdemeanor (based on the factors that the judge will consider, listed below).<span class="emphasisitalic">The Declaration</span>—Here, you state all the important facts about your situation and swear that they are true. Your <em>Declaration</em> must include ANY and ALL<em> </em>of the facts that you have included in the <em>Petition </em>and <em>Memorandum</em> sections.</ol>
                <p class="text"><em>Factors the Judge May Consider:</em>When the judge decides whether or not to reduce your felony to a misdemeanor, here are some of the things s/he will consider. You should emphasize these in your petition:</p>
                <ol class="text">The nature and circumstances of your offense (for example, how old you were at the time; your role in the offense; the specific details of the offense);Whether you have taken responsibility for your conviction and learned from it;Your attitude in court;Your efforts at rehabilitation;Your ability to successfully complete your parole;Your individual situation—why you deserve to have your conviction reduced to a misdemeanor (for example, your work, school, and/or family situation; your accomplishments since your conviction; how you have changed since your conviction; and why reducing your felony to a misdemeanor is necessary in order for you to succeed).<sup><a href="#footnote-3123" id="footnote-ref-3123">[3123]</a></sup></ol>

                <p class="text">You will need to file your petition with the court clerk of the court where you were convicted, and then serve (deliver) copies of your court papers on the District Attorney and any other people who are part of the case. (Ask the court clerk who you need to serve with your court papers). </p>
                <h4 class="step">The Judge Reviews Your Petition to See if You are Eligible</h4>
                <p class="text">After you file your petition, a judge will review it to make sure you are eligible (qualify) for resentencing.<sup><a href="#footnote-3125" id="footnote-ref-3125">[3125]</a></sup> Remember, in order to qualify for resentencing, you must meet all of the following requirements:</p>
                <ol class="text">Your conviction must be for one of the qualifying convictions under Prop 47 (see PG. 1072); ANDYou must NOT have any of the disqualifying convictions (see PG. 1073);<sup><a href="#footnote-3126" id="footnote-ref-3126">[3126]</a></sup> ANDYou are currently “under sentence” for the qualifying conviction (incarcerated OR on parole or PRCS).</ol>
                <h4 class="step">Qualification Hearing—if Requested</h4>
                <ol class="text">When you petition for resentencing under Prop 47, you do not automatically get a hearing in front of a judge, but you may request one. If your conviction was for <em>shoplifting, theft, receiving stolen property, or forgery/bad checks</em>, you may want to request a hearing so you can prove to the judge that the value of property involved in your crime was <em>under $950</em>—and therefore qualifies under Prop 47.The DA can also request a hearing to contest (challenge) your petition. If there is a hearing on your petition, you should attend if you can. Whether or not you are able to attend, make sure that the judge has as much evidence as you can find to support your request for resentencing, including evidence of rehabilitation, proof of your accomplishments since your conviction, and letters of support. (See APPENDIX N, on PG. 1126 for tips on how to write a letter of support. See APPENDIX O, on PG. 1128 for a sample Letter of Support.) If you meet all of the requirements for resentencing, you are entitled to be resentenced UNLESS the judge decides that you pose an “<em>unreasonable risk to public safety.</em>” This means that the judge specifically thinks that if you are released, you will commit one of the<em> violent “super strike” felonies</em> listed in California Penal Code section 667(e)(2)c(iv)).<sup><a href="#footnote-3127" id="footnote-ref-3127">[3127]</a></sup> In making this decision, the judge will consider:your complete conviction history including:<sup><a href="#footnote-3128" id="footnote-ref-3128">[3128]</a></sup>the type of crime(s) you committed in the past;the amount of injury to your victim(s);the length of time you spent in prison in the past; ANDhow long ago you committed the crime(s).your disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while you were in prison;anything else the judge thinks is relevant.You should provide as much evidence as possible that you do not pose any risk to society. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Resentencing</h4>
                <p class="text">If your conviction is eligible, your criminal history does not disqualify you, and the judge does not think you pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, you are entitled to be resentenced to a misdemeanor sentence. This means that your felony sentence will be reduced to a misdemeanor sentence instead! You will get credit for the time you’ve already served, so if you have already served the equivalent of a misdemeanor sentence, you can be released from custody right away.<sup><a href="#footnote-3129" id="footnote-ref-3129">[3129]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text">If you were still in prison at the time of resentencing, the judge will likely put you on parole for one year. However, depending on the facts of your situation, you may be able to convince the judge not to give you parole at all.<sup><a href="#footnote-3130" id="footnote-ref-3130">[3130]</a></sup> If you were on parole or PRCS at the time of resentencing, you could be discharged right away (if you have already completed the equivalent of a misdemeanor sentence), or the judge may reduce your supervision to probation.</ol>
                <div class="headingbold14">RECLASSIFICATION under prop 47:</div>
                <p class="text">If you already completed your sentence (including any parole or probation term) for an offense that qualifies under Prop 47, and you are NOT excluded by one of the disqualifying convictions, you may be eligible to have your felony RECLASSIFIED as a misdemeanor. Unfortunately, you cannot get back the time that you served for the felony, but you can change your criminal record to show a misdemeanor conviction instead of a felony conviction. </p>
                <h4 class="step">Obtain and fill out your Petition for Reclassification</h4>
                <p class="text">Just as for resentencing, you will need to fill out and file a petition for reclassification. Most courts use a single form for resentencing and reclassification, which you should get from the clerk at the court where you were convicted. When you fill out the form, you will need to fill in basic information about your conviction (such as the date of conviction, penal code section, and your sentence), and then check the box indicating that you are requesting reclassification.</p>
                <h4 class="step">File your petition and Serve your court papers</h4>
                <p class="text">File your petition with the clerk of the court where you were convicted, and then serve (deliver) copies of your court papers on the District Attorney and any other people who are part of the case. Ask the court clerk who else you need to serve with your court papers.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Eligibility Determination</h4>
                <p class="text">Once your petition is filed, a judge will review it to make sure you qualify for reclassification.<sup><a href="#footnote-3131" id="footnote-ref-3131">[3131]</a></sup> The judge will check to see whether your conviction offense qualifies under Prop 47 (see PG. 1072) and whether you have any prior convictions that disqualify you (see PG. 1073).<sup><a href="#footnote-3132" id="footnote-ref-3132">[3132]</a></sup> Generally, you will not need to request a hearing for reclassification, however, it is possible that you will need one if you have to prove the value of the property involved in your offense to make sure it qualifies. <strong>If you meet the requirements, the judge MUST reclassify your conviction as a misdemeanor. </strong></p>

                <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppU"></a>Certificates Of Rehabilitation—Period Of Rehabilitation</div>
                <p class="text">The period of rehabilitation is five years residence in California PLUS a period of time (for most, +2 years, but there are exceptions listed below). To figure out your period of rehabilitation, you add the base term of 5 years plus an additional amount of time based on your conviction offense:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3133" id="footnote-ref-3133">[3133]</a></sup></sup></p>
                <ol class="text"><em>Base 5 years</em> + 2 years = 7 years if your conviction was for: California Penal Code sections 311.2(b), (c), or (d), 311.3, 311.10, or 314; Any offense not listed here that does <em>NOT</em> carry a life sentence.<em>Base 5</em> years + 4 years = 9 years if your conviction was for:California Penal Code sections 187, 209, 219, 4500, or 18755;Military &amp; Veterans Code section 1672(a); <em>or</em> Any other offense that carries a life sentence; <em>Base 5</em> + 5 years = 10 years if your conviction was for: Any offense that requires you to register as a Sex Offender under California Penal Code section 290 (including any conviction for an attempted offense);<sup> </sup>Exception: If your conviction was for sections 311.2(b), (c), or (d), 311.3, 311.10, 314, you only need to wait 7 years (see above). </ol>
                <p class="text">In addition to the above requirements, you must have completed any term of probation or parole that was part of your sentence or was a condition of your release. HOWEVER, the time you spend on probation or parole counts toward your total “period of rehabilitation.”<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you served <em>consecutive</em> prison terms, the judge may think that you should wait for a longer period of rehabilitation. If this happens, the judge will deny your COR the first time you apply, and will tell you how much additional time you must wait before you can re-apply.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3134" id="footnote-ref-3134">[3134]</a></sup></sup> <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is possible to apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation before the end of your period of rehabilitation. You must convince the judge that granting your Certificate of Rehabilitation early serves the “interests of justice.”<sup><a href="#footnote-3135" id="footnote-ref-3135">[3135]</a></sup> In other words, you’d better have a really good reason why you should get a COR early. The judge may consider your good conduct, rehabilitation efforts, and how important getting a COR is to your success in the future. (This option is not available to you if you are required to register as a sex offender under California Penal Code section 290.)</p>

                <p class="text">If you meet all of the eligibility requirements for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (see PG. 1078) AND you have completed the period of rehabilitation (see APPENDIX U, on PG. 1148) (or you want to request a COR early), you will need to file papers (called a <em>Petition for Certificate of Rehabilitation</em>) in the criminal court in the county where you <em>currently live</em>. Just like in your criminal case, you have the right to a lawyer to help you with the process of requesting a COR.NOTE: You must request a Certificate of Rehabilitation from the court in the county <em>where you currently live</em>.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Get and Fill out the Court forms</h4>
                <ol class="text">You will need to get and fill out 2 forms for your petition (together, they are called an <em>Application for Certificate of Rehabilitation &amp; Pardon</em>): <em>Notice of Filing for Certificate of Rehabilitation</em>; and <em>Petition for Certificate of Rehabilitation</em>. You will also need to get a <em>Proof of Service</em> form—but don’t fill it out yet.You can get these forms (and instructions for how to fill them out) from:The court clerk;The county Probation Department, or The Public Defender’s Office. You may also be able to download them from the website of your county court (or the court any other county, since the forms are the same statewide). </ol>
                <h4>WHAT SHOULD I SAY IN MY PETITION?</h4>
                <p class="text">The judge wants to know that you are truly rehabilitated. You will need to show that since your release from prison or jail: </p>
                <ol class="text">You have lived “an honest and upright life,” You have behaved with “sobriety and industry,” You have shown “good moral character,” ANDYou have obeyed all laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-3136" id="footnote-ref-3136">[3136]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text">The judge will consider all of these factors when deciding whether or not to grant your COR. Your petition should: </p>
                <ol class="text">Emphasize all of the positive things that you’ve done since your conviction (both while you were incarcerated and since your release), such as: your efforts at rehabilitation (treatment or behavioral programs, period of sobriety, etc.)what you’ve learned and how you’ve changed since your conviction; successful completion of your sentencing and supervision (parole or probation) requirements; ANDany other accomplishments since your conviction, such as employment, school achievements (including any classes, GED, or degree that you’ve completed), volunteer work, community involvement (church, youth groups, mentoring), and family life.If you are requesting a COR to help improve your employment opportunities or for getting a professional or occupational license, make sure you say this in your petition! If you have had any new convictions or violations while on supervision, make sure you explain them—why the conviction happened, what you are doing differently now, and why you will not have the same problems again in the future.If you are currently required to register as a sex offender for your conviction, you must also convince the judge that you do not pose any threat of committing any sex offenses against children.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3137" id="footnote-ref-3137">[3137]</a></sup></sup>You should include as many letters of support and proof of your accomplishments as possible. (See APPENDIX N, on PG. 1126 for tips on getting letters of support).</ol>
                <h4 class="step">File Your Petition with the Court clerk</h4>
                <ol class="text">Once you have filled out your court forms, make at least 5 copies and take everything to the court clerk to be filed. Remember, you will need to file your forms with the criminal court in the county <em>where you currently live</em>.When you file your forms, the clerk will stamp them, give you back the copies, and give you a court date for your hearing. Make sure the date is at least 30 days away. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Serve your Papers on the other parties</h4>
                <ol class="text">You will need to serve your court papers on all of the following people:The District Attorney in the county where you live;The District Attorney(s) in every county(s) where you were convicted (if you have convictions in counties other than the one you live in now);The Governor’s Office. You can serve your papers in person or by mail.You must make sure that all of your papers are served on everyone at least 30 days before your hearing (or 35 days if you are sending them by mail). If you do not serve your papers in time, your petition will be dismissed.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3138" id="footnote-ref-3138">[3138]</a></sup></sup> After you have served all your court papers, fill out the Proof of Service and file it with the court clerk in the county where you live (the same place you filed your Notice and Petition papers in Step 2).</ol>
                <h4 class="step">Investigation by DA</h4>
                <ol class="text">After you file your petition, the judge may ask the DA to do an investigation of your life, conduct, and rehabilitation since your release. As part of the investigation, the DA may contact you directly; may talk to your family, employer, and neighbors; and may also get any records or reports related to your conviction, including trial documents, prison records, and probation/parole reports. Afterward, the DA will prepare a report for the judge, which will help the judge decide whether to grant your COR.</ol>
                <h4 class="step">The Court Hearing</h4>
                <ol class="text">Make sure you attend your court hearing on the date and time the clerk gave you! Remember, the hearing is your chance to make a good impression on the judge!During the hearing, the judge will consider your criminal history, your behavior in custody, and your conduct since your release. The judge will look at any reports or records from the District Attorney’s investigation, and may also ask you or other people to answer questions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3139" id="footnote-ref-3139">[3139]</a></sup></sup> You should be prepared to answer any questions from the judge about your conviction, your life and conduct since then, and any information in your petition. Just like in a criminal case, make sure to stay calm and respectful no matter what is said about you or your past. In order to grant your COR, the court must find that you are rehabilitated and ready to be a responsible member of society—in other words, that you are ready to have all the <em>civil and political rights of citizenship</em>. If you are required to register as a sex offender due to your conviction, the judge must also find that you do not pose any threat of committing any sex offenses against children.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3140" id="footnote-ref-3140">[3140]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="step">Success! </h4>
                <p class="text">If the judge grants your request for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, s/he will give you your certificate, and will also send a copy to the Governor’s Office. The COR serves as an official recommendation from the judge that the Governor grant you a full pardon. The COR also automatically serves as your application to the Governor for a pardon, so you will not have to do anything more to apply for one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3141" id="footnote-ref-3141">[3141]</a></sup></sup> (For information about Governor’s pardons, see PG. 1082, and APPENDIX W, on PG. 1152.)</p>
                <h4 class="step">If Denied, The Appeal</h4>
                <ol class="text">If the judge decides not to grant your Certificate of Rehabilitation, you can re-apply for a COR any time in the future.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3142" id="footnote-ref-3142">[3142]</a></sup></sup> However, pay attention to the judge’s reasons for denying your request so that you can fix or improve them before you re-file. This will increase your chances of being granted a COR the next time. If the judge set a new period of rehabilitation for you (because you served consecutive prison terms, or you have a new conviction), you will need to wait out this additional period before you can re-apply for a COR.</ol>

This means that you will have to get your original petition back from the law enforcement agency that you gave it to, and then file it with the court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3154" id="footnote-ref-3154">[3154]</a></sup></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">OPTION 2:</span> If you filed your petition with the court (either first, or after it was denied by the law enforcement agency), there will be a hearing in front of a judge who will decide whether or not to grant your petition.<sup><a href="#footnote-3155" id="footnote-ref-3155">[3155]</a></sup> At the hearing, you (or your lawyer) will present evidence of your factual innocence, and try to convince the court to grant your petition to have your arrest record sealed. The District Attorney may present evidence and argument against you.<sup><a href="#footnote-3156" id="footnote-ref-3156">[3156]</a></sup></ol>
                <h4 class="step">The Decision</h4>
                <p class="text">If the court finds that you are factually innocent, the judge will grant your petition and order that your arrest record and all related information be sealed for three years and then destroyed. If the judge does not find you factually innocent (denies your petition), you can appeal the decision.</p>

                <div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EX_TOC_AppY"></a>How to Seal Juvenile Records</div>
                <h4 class="step">Get a copy of your Juvenile Records</h4>
                <p class="text">It is very important that you get a copy of your juvenile record and know exactly what is in it, because you will need this information to fill out your court forms properly. You can get a copy of your juvenile from the Clerk’s Office of the Juvenile Court where your case was adjudicated.<sup><a href="#footnote-3157" id="footnote-ref-3157">[3157]</a></sup> Make sure you bring a photo ID with you, or you will not be able to get your record.</p>
                <h4 class="step">Get and Fill out a Petition to Seal Juvenile Records</h4>
                <p class="text">When you go to the clerk’s office to get a copy of your juvenile record, you should also ask the clerk for a copy of the proper form, called a <em>Petition to Seal Juvenile Records</em>, and any instructions that go with it. Follow the instructions carefully, especially when you are asked to list the arrests or charges that you want sealed. ONLY THE ONES YOU LIST WILL BE SEALED! This is why it is important to have a copy of your juvenile record with you so you do not miss anything.<sup><a href="#footnote-3158" id="footnote-ref-3158">[3158]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4 class="step">File your Petition</h4>
                <ol class="text">Take your completed petition back to the Clerk’s Office of the juvenile court you were adjudicated in and file it with the clerk. Ask the clerk if the petition needs to be served on any other parties (such as the District Attorney or the Probation Department). If it does, be sure to ask the clerk if the clerk’s office will serve it, or if you have to serve the papers yourself. After you have filed your petition, you will get a court date for a hearing. The clerk may set the hearing date when you file your petition, or you may receive a Notice of Hearing in the mail (it can take several weeks to get your Notice of Hearing by mail). </ol>
                <h4 class="step">The Hearing</h4>
                <ol class="text">At the hearing, the judge will consider your petition AND get a recommendation from the probation department about whether your record should be sealed. You are not required to attend the hearing, but it is a good idea to go so that you can answer any questions that the judge might have. You are also allowed to bring witnesses to testify on your behalf (such as a pastor, teacher, employer, counselor, or other people who know you and can speak positively about you). After the hearing, the judge will rule on (decide) whether or not to seal your records. If the judge grants your petition and seals your records, s/he will also order all other agencies that have juvenile records on you (such as the police, probation department, DOJ, and DA) to seal their records also. </ol>
                <h4 class="step">Appeal</h4>
                <p class="text">If the judge denies your petition, ask the judge if and when you will be able to re-file your petition. You should also ask the judge for the reasons why s/he denied your petition, so that you can fix or address any problems before you re-file. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: As of January 1, 2015, California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code Section 786 changed so that juveniles who successfully complete probation, and otherwise qualify to have their record sealed, will have their juvenile record <em>automatically</em> sealed by the judge, <em>without</em> having to file a petition in court or do anything else.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3159" id="footnote-ref-3159">[3159]</a></sup></strong> However, this DOES NOT apply to juveniles who completed their probation BEFORE January 1, 2015. If you completed your juvenile probation BEFORE January 1, 2015, you will still need to file a petition in court to have your juvenile record sealed.</p>
