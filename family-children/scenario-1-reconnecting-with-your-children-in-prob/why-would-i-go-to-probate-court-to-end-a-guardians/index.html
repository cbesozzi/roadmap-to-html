  <h1>Why would I go to probate court to end a guardianship?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc317247510"></a><a id="_Toc448153609"></a>Why would I go to probate court to end a guardianship?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">You would go to probate court to end a guardianship if someone else (other than the child’s parents) was given guardianship of your child while you were incarcerated. If a judge in probate court formally created the guardianship, then you have to go to probate court to end it. </p>
  
  <h5 class="question">If I have been incarcerated and someone else is the guardian of my child, what are my legal rights as a parent?</h5>
  
  <p class="text">Guardianship does NOT end your parental rights; it only puts your parental rights on hold while the guardian has custody of the child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2343" id="footnote-ref-2343">[2311]</a></sup> </sup>This allows the guardian(s) to make all the decisions about caring for the child that a parent would make, without permanently cutting off the parents’ rights to ask for custody of their child back in the future.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2344" id="footnote-ref-2344">[2312]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Parent’s Rights:</span></p>
  
  <p class="text">The child’s legal or biological parents still have certain <em>rights</em> for their child during the guardianship:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">The children in a guardianship are still considered legally and biologically “related” to their parents (the parents’ rights are not terminated);</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The judge or the guardian of the child can allow the parents or other relatives to visit with the children in a guardianship;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2345" id="footnote-ref-2345">[2313]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">When the judge appoints a guardian to have custody of a child, the judge may also give visitation rights to the child’s parent(s) and/or sibling(s) to visit the child</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If the judge orders visitation, the child’s guardian must allow these visits to take place. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If there is no court order for visitation, the guardian has the right to decide whether the child may visit with his/her parent(s) or other relatives.<strong> </strong>So if you don't have a court order and the guardian is not letting you see your child, you might need to go to Probate Court to ask the judge for visitation. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Please Note:</em> You will need to ask for visitation from <em>the same probate court</em> that appointed your child’s current guardian, which may be in a different county from where you live. You will also need to use that county’s own specific probate court forms to request visitation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2346" id="footnote-ref-2346">[2314]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Parent’s Responsibilities:</span></p>
  
  <p class="text">The child’s legal or biological parents also still have certain <em>responsibilities</em> for their child during the guardianship:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">Parents must continue to financially support their children in a guardianship (including paying child support if it’s ordered – read more about child support on PG. 960. Also, children in a guardianship can inherit money or get Social Security benefits from their parents.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2347" id="footnote-ref-2347">[2315]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If you are currently or about to become incarcerated and would like to learn how to pause your child support payments, see PG. 962 in the “Child Support” section.</ol>
