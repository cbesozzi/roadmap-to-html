  <h2><a href="/education/high-school-credentials/general-educational-development-ged-tests/how-do-i-prepare-for-the-ged-test/index.html">How do I prepare for the GED test?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    How do I prepare for the GED test?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    FIRST: Learn as much as you can about the GED test. You should know: What subjects and skills does the test cover? How long does the test take? What do the questions look like? You can get information by contacting the GED Testing Service (see PG. 1058 for contact information), by asking teachers or tutors in a GED program, and by looking at GED practice tests and study materials (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials). Here is some general information to start with:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The GED test has 4 modules (subject-matter tests): language arts, math, social studies, and science. You can take all 4 modules on the same day, which takes 7+ hours; or you can schedule them for separate dates.[2691] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As of January 1, 2014, the GED test is computer-based; but if you’re in a prison or jail that doesn’t have computers set up, you might be taking the test with a pencil and paper.[2692] To find out which version of the test you’ll take, ask your facility’s education department staff. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SECOND: Learn as much as possible about your readiness for the test. You should know:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Which subjects or skills do you feel confident about, and which ones should you focus on improving? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How comfortable do you feel with the test format? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do you need to practice answering test questions more quickly? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What study methods are best for your current skills and learning style? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can get a sense of how ready you are by taking practice GED tests on your own, and/or by working with teachers or tutors in a GED program who can give you feedback about your skills (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials, including practice tests). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    THIRD: Make use of teaching, tutoring, and study materials that are available to you. Below is general information about potential resources that you may be able to use:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: When you get to your federal facility, staff will review your county jail assessment information. If you don’t have a high school degree, you will be enrolled in classes designed to lead up to a GED or a high school diploma (unless they decide that you must take Adult Basic Education classes first).[2693] Ask your education advisor if you have questions about enrollment. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: If you don’t have a high school credential, you can enroll in GED classes if your TABE scores qualify you.[2694] You may also be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP).[2695] Ask your correctional counselor or education department staff about enrolling in GED classes or VEP. (Remember, before you enroll in GED or VEP, you must have a TABE score on file.[2696] See PG. 1048 for information about the TABE and getting an educational assessment). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: If your educational assessment scores qualify you for GED courses, your facility should enroll you if they offer these courses.[2697] If not, you can contact community service organizations to request materials. See Appendix B, PG. 1095 for a list or organizations that provide GED materials. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: If you are in county jail awaiting transfer to a federal or state facility, you will NOT be allowed to take anything with you, including any books or other materials related to your educational programming, when you are transferred. You will need to gather all of your materials ahead of time and mail them to someone on the outside before you are transferred. That person can then mail your materials back to you at your new facility.[2698]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Even though most facilities in California at the federal, state, and county level offer GED classes, often there are long waiting lists to get in, or they are offered in “cycles” (which means that if you miss the beginning of the cycle, you cannot enroll until the next one). If you cannot enroll in a GED class for any reason, you should try to begin studying on your own. Check your facility’s library for GED “prep” books and materials. These resources will walk you through lesson plans, and usually contain sample questions and practice tests.[2699] They can also be ordered through most book distributors. Check with your facility for a list of book distributors that are approved to send materials to inmates. There are also a number of community adult literacy programs and other service organizations that will send books and materials to incarcerated people for free. You can contact these organizations to request the study materials you need. For a list of organizations that provide books and materials to incarcerated people, visit Urbana Campaign to Prisoners at http://www.books2prisoners.org/partnerships.php or see Appendix B, PG. 1095. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    WHEN PREPARING FOR BOTH THE GED EXAM AND RELEASE:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are preparing for a GED test while incarcerated and find out that you will be released before you finish your class or program, ask your GED teacher for a “progress report.” This report will show exactly where you are in the process, so that you can pick up your studies in the same place after your release.[2700] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit your local America’s Job Center of California (formerly Career One-Stop Centers) for information on GED programs in your area (see PG. 1030 for information on finding your local America’s Job Center of California).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Contact your local public library, adult school, or community college to ask about free or low-cost GED classes near you.[2701]
