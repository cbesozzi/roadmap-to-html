    How do I apply for CalFresh?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The process may vary by county. Generally, it involves filling out a form, providing documents, and having an interview. For details about how to apply in your county, contact the CalFresh office in your area. For a directory of county CalFresh offices, see Appendix A, on PG. 634.[1388] For information on how to apply for CalFresh benefits in your county, please call 1-877-847-3663. You can also apply online at http://benefitscal.org.

    Helpful Hint:What is an “Authorized Representative (AR)”?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can select and authorize any adult person as an Authorized Representative (AR) to apply and have the interview on your behalf. To find out how, contact the CalFresh office or Social Services Agency in the county where you’ll be living.

  <p>
    Can I apply for CalFresh while incarcerated? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes! You can’t receive CalFresh benefits until you’re out, but, under some circumstances, you can apply while in prison or jail.[1389] Although you may apply for CalFresh while incarcerated, you should not do so unless you are less than 30 days from your release date. (If you apply for CalFresh more than 30 days before your release date, the county social services agency will probably deny your application because they will find that you are not eligible for the program yet – but you can re-apply again once you’re within 30 days of release or after you get out.[1390]) If you apply for CalFresh benefits while incarcerated, you will generally need to provide proof of your release date and a local address within the county.[1391] You must also complete and sign the application and designate an Authorized Representative (see Helpful Hint Box for more information.)[1392] If you are approved for CalFresh benefits, you will not begin receiving these benefits until after you get out.[1393]
