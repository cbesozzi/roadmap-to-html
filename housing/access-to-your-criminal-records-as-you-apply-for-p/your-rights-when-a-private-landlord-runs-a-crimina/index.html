        <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc352861423"></a>Your Rights When a Private Landlord Runs a Criminal Background Check</h3>
        <p class="text">As an applicant to private housing, you have legal rights related to the information that comes up in a private background check, and how a private landlord may use it. The law protects you by making it illegal for certain types of information to be included in a criminal background check (also called a ‚Äútenant report,‚Äù or in California, a ‚Äúconsumer report‚Äù) on you. But there are a lot of laws that limit what a private background check company creating a tenant report for a landlord can share with them.</p>
