          <h3><a id="_Toc448153513"></a>How can my court-ordered debt affect me while I am on a term of supervision?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you are under any type of supervision—parole, mandatory supervision, Post-Release Community Supervision, or probation—it is very important to know which debts are conditions of that supervision, and to pay them first, if possible. In general, making restitution payments will ALWAYS be a condition of your supervision.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2087" id="footnote-ref-2087">[2056]</a></sup> Other fines and fees can also be ordered as conditions of supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-2088" id="footnote-ref-2088">[2057]</a></sup> You can find out exactly which payments the court considers conditions of your probation by asking your parole or probation officer for a copy of your supervision order. You (or your attorney) can also go to the court and ask the clerk for a copy of the records (the “minutes”) from your sentencing. </p>
          <p class="text">If you don’t pay the debts that are conditions of your supervision: (1) the court can <em>extend</em> the term of your supervision to the maximum time allowed,<sup><a href="#footnote-2089" id="footnote-ref-2089">[2058]</a></sup> or (2) the court may order you to do community service to satisfy your remaining fines and fees, or (3) the court may determine that you have violated your supervision and re-incarcerate you. If you are on probation and you complete your probation term, but you haven’t paid off all the restitution and fines that are conditions of your probation, the court may find that you <em>did NOT successfully complete probation</em>. This can make it harder to get your conviction dismissed later under California’s expungement statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-2090" id="footnote-ref-2090">[2059]</a></sup> However, due to a recent court decision, you cannot be denied mandatory expungement because you still owe victim restitution. See PG. 1168 for more information on mandatory and expungement and victim restitution. </p>
          <p class="text">Here are other ways that owing unpaid restitution and other fines can affect you while you are on supervision:</p>
          <ol class="text">It can be harder to transfer to another county, and you will NOT be allowed to transfer out of state.<sup><a href="#footnote-2091" id="footnote-ref-2091">[2060]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you want to get discharged early, it is very important to make reasonable restitution payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2092" id="footnote-ref-2092">[2061]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Even if you successfully complete your supervision and are discharged, you will continue to owe any unpaid restitution (and all other debts that the court does not discharge).<sup><a href="#footnote-2093" id="footnote-ref-2093">[2062]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT!—If you are UNDER ANY KIND OF SUPERVISION: <em>It is very important to know which debts are conditions of that supervision—and to pay them first, if possible.</em> In general, making <em>restitution</em> payments will ALWAYS be a condition of your supervision.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2094" id="footnote-ref-2094">[2063]</a></sup></strong> <em>Other fines and fees</em> can also be ordered as conditions of supervision.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2095" id="footnote-ref-2095">[2064]</a></sup></strong> You can find out exactly which payments the court considers conditions of your probation by asking your parole or probation officer for a copy of your supervision order. You (or your attorney) can also go to the court and ask the clerk for a copy of the records (the “minutes”) from your sentencing. If you don’t pay the debts that are conditions of your supervision, (1) the court can <em>extend</em> the term of your supervision to the maximum time allowed (for probation) to give you more time to make payments,<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2096" id="footnote-ref-2096">[2065]</a></sup></strong> or (2) the court may order you to do community service to satisfy your remaining fines and fees, or (3) the court may determine that you have violated your supervision and re-incarcerate you. If you are on probation and you complete your probation term, a court may decide that you <em>did NOT successfully complete probation</em> if you haven’t paid of your restitution and fines. This can make it harder to get your conviction dismissed later under California’s expungement statute.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2097" id="footnote-ref-2097">[2066]</a></sup></strong> However, due to a recent court case in California, <em>a judge cannot deny you a mandatory dismissal just because you still owe victim restitution</em>. See PG. 1168 for more information on victim restitution and mandatory expungement.</p>
