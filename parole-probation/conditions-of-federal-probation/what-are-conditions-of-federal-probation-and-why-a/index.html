  <h3><a id="_Toc448152984"></a>What are conditions of federal probation, and why are they important?</h3>
  
  <p>Your conditions of federal probation are the rules set by the judge that you must follow if you want to remain in the community under supervision, and not be sent back to prison. These are called “release conditions”—they tell you what you can and can’t do in the community. These conditions are broken down into two types: (1) mandatory conditions and (2) discretionary conditions. </p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Examples include:</em></strong></p>
  
  <ol class="text">Not being able to own/store guns or other weapons;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">No contact with victims or witnesses; restrict your association with certain people or groups;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Restricted travel;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Curfews;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Community service;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Electronic monitoring;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Employment requirements;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Mental health treatment;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Substance abuse treatment.</ol>
  
  <p>It is important for you to know what conditions <em>you must follow</em> on federal probation so that you don’t get into trouble or sent to prison for violating those rules. </p>
  
  <p>Also: be sure to talk to your U.S. Probation Officer about how to get connected to any needed services or resources offered in your community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-795" id="footnote-ref-795">[769]</a></sup></sup></p>
