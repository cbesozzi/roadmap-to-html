  <p>
    Where will I be released to on PRCS?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In most cases, you will be sent to the county of your last legal residence before you were incarcerated.[649] However, CDCR can send you to PRCS in a different county for various reasons, including victim safety concerns, to help you maintain family ties, or so you can benefit from work or educational programs.[650]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Please keep reading for more information on how to make a request to be sent to a different county other than the one you last legally lived in.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can I request that CDCR send me to PRCS in a different county than where they want to send me? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. While you are in prison, you can request to be released on to PRCS in a different county than where CDCR has assigned you—which is typically the county of last legal residence. Please read the section on how to request a PRCS County Transfer, beginning on PG. 222.
