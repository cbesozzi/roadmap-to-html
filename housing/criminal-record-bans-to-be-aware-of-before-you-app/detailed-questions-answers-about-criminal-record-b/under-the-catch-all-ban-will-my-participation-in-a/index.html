  <p>
    Under the “catch-all” ban, will my participation in a pre-trial intervention or diversion program matter?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the program shows up on your background check as a conviction, then the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing can consider it, and possibly deny you.[1147] SO it depends on how it comes up on your background check. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are placed into a pre-trial intervention program and you do NOT have to plead guilty in order to participate, then a background check report will probably show the filing of a case, but no conviction while you are participating in the program.[1148] If you successfully complete the program, then your case will be dismissed without a conviction ever having been recorded. Therefore, it CANNOT show up as a conviction in a background check, because it never was one.[1149] If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.[1150]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If instead you are placed in a pre-trial intervention program that requires you to plead guilty, then this guilty plea will probably appear as a conviction on a background check report while you are still participating in the program. If you successfully complete the program, your guilty plea should be automatically withdrawn and those records sealed, after which a private background check company CANNOT report this as a conviction.[1151] If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.[1152]
