    What is ABE? How can it help me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adult Basic Education (ABE) is for adults who want to gain the basic skills and knowledge needed for school, work, and everyday life. You can find free or low-cost ABE classes at adult schools (also called “adult education programs”) across the country.[2661] ABE programs often offer the following kinds of classes:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Basic literacy classes help you learn to read and write for the first time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Reading, writing, and math classes help you improve your English language skills and math skills. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Life skills classes build your skills in money management, communication, computer use, etc.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pre-GED classes help you prepare to pass the General Education Development exam.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    English as a Second Language (ESL) classes improve your fluency in English, if it isn’t your native language.[2662]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your assessment test (see PG. 1048) will tell you what skills you need to improve, and therefore which ABE classes are right for you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How much do ABE classes cost? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re incarcerated 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison,[2663] a California state prison,[2664] or a California county jail,[2665] ABE classes (including necessary books and study materials) are offered at no cost to you.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Free or low-cost ABE classes may be available in adult schools or community colleges near you. Many schools provide ABE classes for free, and provide books and materials for free too. Others may charge registration and tuition fees (up to $25-50 per semester or per class) and/or require you to buy your own books and materials. Some schools that charge fees may also offer financial aid to low-income students. You will need to check with the individual school or program about fees and financial aid.[2666]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I get into ABE classes? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: Soon after you enter prison, your unit team and education department staff should give you an assessment test and recommend classes for you. You should then have access to ABE classes. (In federal facilities, ABE is part of a broader program called Adult Continuing Education or ACE). If your assessment shows that you’re not fluent in English, you must be enrolled in ESL, and if you don’t have a high school degree, you must be enrolled in classes designed to lead to a GED or high school diploma.[2667] If you’re not enrolled in these classes for some reason, but you want to be, ask your education advisor about getting placed into these classes.[2668]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: To enroll in any education program, you must have a TABE score on file. (To learn how to sign up for TABE, see PG. 1048.) Once you’ve done the TABE assessment, you should be able to attend ABE classes that are right for your level.[2669] For example, if you’re not fluent in English, you must be enrolled in ESL, and if you’re reading below a 6th grade level, you must be enrolled in basic literacy classes.[2670] You may also be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP).[2671] If you’re not enrolled in these programs, but you want to be, ask your correctional counselor or education department staff. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: Although educational programs vary by county, if your facility offers educational programming, Adult Basic Education will most likely be part of it.[2672] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Visit any public library or community bookstore to find free or low-cost ABE study materials, including books for the classroom and self-study books that you can work through on your own. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Contact any public library, adult school, or community college to ask about ABE classes near you.[2673]

    GED vs. High school diploma
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A GED is a high school proficiency test, which may allow you to earn a high school equivalency certificate in a more expedited manner or at your own pace. The test requires you to pass 4 parts in different subjects matters at your own pace. However, An adult high school diploma requires more coursework prior to obtaining your diploma. An Adult High School Diploma requires certain coursework to be completed at your own pace. After all the coursework is completed, you will be required to pass an exit exam called California High School Exit Examination. It is important to note that if you have already completed many high school courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, a high school diploma program may be a faster route than a GED.
