          <h4 class="sidebox">What are examples of legal cases involving children?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Examples of legal cases involving children include cases about: custody, visitation, ending a marriage, adoption, guardianship, CPS/dependency cases, and fostering a child.  These cases may also involve questions about paternity/parentage, child support, spousal support, and/or protective orders.</p>
          <p class="text">In any legal case involving children, a criminal record could, and often does, affect your ability to reconnect with a child or grandchild.</p>
          <p class="text">A judge making decisions about the care of a child will look at anything and everything about a child’s and the parents’ life that relates to the well-being of the child and who is best suited to care for and have a relationship with that child.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2261" id="footnote-ref-2261">[2229]</a></sup> </sup>This includes the judge looking at things like:</p>
          <ol class="text">Your FULL criminal record (including dismissed/expunged/sealed records);<sup><a href="#footnote-2262" id="footnote-ref-2262">[2230]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Your Child Protective Services (CPS) records;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Current or past court orders;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Current or past stay-away or protective orders against you (or that you took out against someone else); <sup><a href="#footnote-2263" id="footnote-ref-2263">[2231]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Social media like Facebook, Instagram accounts, etc. for any evidence about you as a person and parent;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your home and setup, in which Court investigators and sometimes attorneys and social workers will visit the place you live to assess you, your interactions with your child and other people in your home; and your overall living situation;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2264" id="footnote-ref-2264">[2232]</a></sup></sup> and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your past and current contact with your child.<a id="_Toc314389681"></a></ol>
          <p class="text">Even though your record will come up in court, it is often STILL POSSIBLE to reconnect with your child or grandchild.</p>
