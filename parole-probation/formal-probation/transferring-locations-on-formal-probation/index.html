  <p>
    I want to transfer my formal probation to another county. can I do that?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s possible. The California Superior Court of the county that you were convicted of a crime in has jurisdiction (decision-making power) over county-to-county transfers for probation.[637]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When deciding whether transfer is appropriate, the judge will look at:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Permanency of your residence (whether you actually live in the transfer county permanently);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Local programs available for you in the transfer county; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Restitution orders and victim issues.[638]
  </p>

    I am on formal probation and want to transfer to another county. How can I do that?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The rules and process for transferring your formal probation to another county are the same as the rules that apply to informal probation.[639] For more information on this process, see PG. 213.
