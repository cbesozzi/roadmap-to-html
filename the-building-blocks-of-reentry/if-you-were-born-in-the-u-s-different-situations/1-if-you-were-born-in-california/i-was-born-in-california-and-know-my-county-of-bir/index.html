          <p class="text">If you know what county you were born in, we recommend going directly through your County Recorder’s Office. Because the CDPH handles requests for the entire state, it often takes longer than if you go directly to the County Recorder’s Office, where it will be a much faster process (sometimes even the same day).<sup><a href="#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25">[25]</a></sup> The County Recorder’s Office is also more convenient because you can make your request <em>in person</em> as well as by mail.</p>
