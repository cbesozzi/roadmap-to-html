          <h3><a id="_Toc290125889"></a><a id="_Toc448153299"></a>Can I apply for WIC while incarcerated?</h3>
          <p class="text">No. You can only apply for WIC after you are released because eligibility can only be determined after an in-person appointment with a county health professional who will assess you and your child for nutritional risk. Additionally, WIC benefits can only be used in-person at certain locations (such as grocery stores) certified to participate in the program. But remember: you can call the WIC office to help you review your eligibility before your release. To find contact information for your county WIC office, call the following toll free number: 1-800-852-5770. </p>

          <ul class="learn-bullets">An overview of different types of health care coverage in California (including Covered California, Medi-Cal, &amp; Medicare) How to figure out which health care plan is best for youWhat benefits you get from the different health care plansHow to apply for health care Whether you can receive or apply for health care while incarcerated How your criminal history could affect your ability to get health care coverageWhat to do if you are wrongly denied health care </ul>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125891"></a><a id="_Toc448153301"></a>Why should I get health care coverage (insurance)?<em> </em></h3>
          <p class="text">First, everyone needs health care at some point in life. If you have health care coverage, you can access hospitals and medical services when you need them. Most health insurance will cover mental health and substance abuse treatment too.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1438" id="footnote-ref-1438">[1408]</a></sup></sup> Second, for almost everyone living in the U.S., it’s now required by law that you have adequate health care coverage. (There are exceptions, explained on PG. 532).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1439" id="footnote-ref-1439">[1409]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">While you’re incarcerated, the jail or prison is responsible for providing you with essential health care, including mental health services. You have a constitutional right to treatment while in jail or prison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1440" id="footnote-ref-1440">[1410]</a></sup></sup> Once you have a release date, you should ensure that you have health care coverage in place for when you get out. </p>
