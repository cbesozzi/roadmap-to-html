  <p>
    What will the judge look for if I Have to go to court for “progress reports?”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you go to court for a “progress report,” the judge will be checking to see if you are following the conditions of your probation. The judge will also ask you about your participation in any programs (e.g. AA meetings, anger management classes) that you were assigned as part of your probation. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It is important that you BRING DOCUMENTATION of any progress or positive steps that you’ve made toward fulfilling your probation conditions. For example, you should bring written proof of your attendance in court-ordered treatment programs, or of the number of hours of community service or public works service you have completed.
