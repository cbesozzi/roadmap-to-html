  <p>
    Do I have to pay a court fee to participate in the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. The courts can collect a maximum fee of $50 to cover program administration costs.[2207] The fee can be added to the overall amount you pay, and does not have to be paid up front. It can be added to your balance and be paid through your payment plan. The DMV will also charge a $55 fee for reinstating (giving back) your California driver license,[2208] as it does for all license reinstatements.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you live in San Francisco County: The Department of Human Services is paying the $50 court fee (but not the $55 DMV fee) for any county cash aid recipients.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you live in Los Angeles County: The Los Angeles County superior courts are waiving the court fee (but not the $55 DMV fee) for people who are receiving public benefits or very low-income (below 125% of the Federal Poverty Line).
