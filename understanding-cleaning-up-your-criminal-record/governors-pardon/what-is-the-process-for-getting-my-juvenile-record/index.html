        <h3><a id="_Toc448153974"></a>What is the process for getting my juvenile record sealed?</h3>
        <p class="text">To get your juvenile record sealed, you will need to file a request (called a Petition to Seal Juvenile Records) in the juvenile court where your case was adjudicated. You will have a hearing where the judge will review your petition and ask for a recommendation from the probation department. You will need to answer any questions the judge has, and you can bring people to testify on your behalf. The judge will then decide whether or not to grant your request. If the judge decides to seal you record, s/he will also order all other agencies that have juvenile records on you to seal their records as well. If the judge does not decide to seal your record, you are allowed to refile your petition (the judge will tell you when). </p>
        <p class="text">For more information and instructions on how to seal your juvenile record, see APPENDIX Y, on PG. 1262.)</p>
        <p class="text">For more information about sealing juvenile records in general, see Sealing Your Juvenile Records—a helpful guide from <em>Public Counsel</em>, available online at <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/publications/files/Sealing-your-Juvenile-Record.pdf">http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/publications/files/Sealing-your-Juvenile-Record.pdf</a>.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: As of January 1, 2015, California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code section 786 changed so that juveniles who successfully complete probation, and otherwise qualify to have their record sealed, will have their juvenile record <em>automatically</em> sealed by the judge, <em>without</em> having to file a petition in court or do anything else.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3178" id="footnote-ref-3178">[3142]</a></sup></strong> However, this DOES NOT apply to juveniles who completed their probation BEFORE January 1, 2015. If you completed your juvenile probation BEFORE January 1, 2015, you will still need to file a petition in court to have your juvenile record sealed. </p>
