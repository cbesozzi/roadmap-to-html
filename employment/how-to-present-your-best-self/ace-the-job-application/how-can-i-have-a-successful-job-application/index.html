  <h1>How can i have a successful job application?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153400"></a>How can i have a successful job application?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">In the past, applying for a job meant filling out a paper application and handing (or mailing) it to the employer. Now, any information that you give about yourself may become part of your job application that the employer considers. This includes information you share with the employer or other employees at the company, with a temp agency, at a job fair, at a workforce development center, or with other people or organizations that are involved in your job search process. It can include paperwork you fill out or sign, a questionnaire that you complete, information that you type in online, documents you hand in, or answers/information that you say in person.</p>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTS</h4>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Listing Previous Work Experience</em></ol>
  
  <p class="textbox">If an application asks about your previous work experience, MAKE SURE you accurately write the dates of your previous employment and how much you were paid! The new employer will probably contact your former employers to check your references and ask about this information. If you list incorrect information about the dates you were employed or your wages at your past job (even by mistake!), the new employer may think you’re intentionally lying and may reject your application for that reason. If you can’t remember the exact dates you worked or your wages, write down that you are guessing or estimating this information, and that you are NOT certain. This will show the employer that you’re trying to be honest and are not intentionally giving wrong information.</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Listing personal and professional references</em></ol>
  
  <p class="textbox">When you apply for a job, you will probably have to give a list of references—people who know you and can talk about whether you’re a good worker. Most likely this will be an old employer, but it could also be a teacher from a vocational training or certification program, or even someone from your church or other community organization that you’re involved in. The new employer will contact these people to ask about your previous work history, personality, whether you were a good employee, and other information to help decide if they should hire you.Be careful about whom you list as a reference and what they will say about you! BEFORE you list someone as a reference, it is best to call the person (or have a trusted person call for you) to ask what they will say about you. If it turns out they say something negative, you’ll know not to list them after all. Keep in mind that even if you don’t list someone as a reference, an employer or background check company may still contact them as part of their own background check process.</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Ask your trusted person!</em></ol>
  
  <p class="textbox">If you’re filling out a paper or online application, ask your trusted person, or someone from a local reentry or workforce development program, to look over your completed application before you send it to the employer.</p>
