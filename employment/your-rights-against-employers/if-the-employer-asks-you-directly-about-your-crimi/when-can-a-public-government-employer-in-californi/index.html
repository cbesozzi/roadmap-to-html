  <p>
    When can a public (government) employer in California ask about my criminal record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Because of the recent state law known as “Ban the Box,” public employers in California CANNOT ask you—in-person, verbally, or in writing on a job application—ANY information about your conviction history until AFTER the employer has determined that you meet the minimum job requirements. This law applies statewide to ALL state and local government employers, but does NOT apply to federal government jobs, jobs with law enforcement, or positions that require a criminal background check by law.[1762] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Please Note: The current interpretation of California's "Ban the Box" law is that it does not apply to community colleges in their function as state employers, meaning that they are legally allowed to ask you certain questions about your criminal record in the initial application—but nothing from the list of “never-ask” criminal background questions starting on PG. 708).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some cities and counties in California (such as San Francisco, Richmond, and Compton) have passed their own local “Ban the Box” laws that sometimes apply to certain private employers. Los Angeles County is currently considering passing its own local “Ban the Box” law in 2016, as well. See Appendix F, PG. 778, for more information about local “Ban the Box” laws in California (such as the one in San Francisco called the “Fair Chance Ordinance”).
