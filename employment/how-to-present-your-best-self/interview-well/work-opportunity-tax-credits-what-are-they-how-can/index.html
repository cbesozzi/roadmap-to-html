          <h1>Work Opportunity Tax Credits: What are they & how can they encourage employers to hire me?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153404"></a>Work Opportunity Tax Credits: What are they &amp; how can they encourage employers to hire me?</h3>
          <p class="text">Suggest that your employer look into the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal tax credit historically available to employers for hiring job applicants who face significant barriers to employment, including people with felony convictions who are hired within 1 year after their conviction or release from prison, veterans, and recipients of certain public benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1772" id="footnote-ref-1772">[1742]</a></sup> (For this reason, be sure to answer truthfully if an employer or job application asks whether you receive public benefits!) The WOTC ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, depending on your hours and pay during your first year as an employee, and on the maximum allowed credit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1773" id="footnote-ref-1773">[1743]</a></sup> For more information about the WOTC in California, contact the WOTC Coordinator at (916) 227-5163, or visit the Employment Development Department‚Äôs (EDD) website about the WOTC at: <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm</a>. </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Although the legal authority for the WOTC expired on December 31, 2013, tell your employer that he/she should continue to submit WOTC applications to the EDD. In the past, when the WOTC expired, Congress eventually reauthorized the tax credit and applied it retroactively; so it‚Äôs recommended that employers continue to submit applications while reauthorization is pending.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1774" id="footnote-ref-1774">[1744]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
