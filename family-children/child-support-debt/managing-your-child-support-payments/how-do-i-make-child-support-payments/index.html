          <p class="text">You can make payments by one of the following methods, depending on whether or not the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) is involved:</p>
          <ol class="text">If the LCSA is involved (there is a formal arrangement for support payments between you and the other parent or caregiver:</ol>
          <ol class="text">When you pay your child support, you are making these payments to the California State Disbursement Unit (SDU).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2497" id="footnote-ref-2497">[2465]</a></sup></sup> Under federal law, the California SDU is required to process 100% of child support payments (which used to be processed by the LCSA itself, but no longer).<sup><a href="#footnote-2498" id="footnote-ref-2498">[2466]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Mail your payment (check or money order) to the California SDU at the following address:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2499" id="footnote-ref-2499">[2467]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">California SDU, P.O. Box 989067, West Sacramento, CA 95798-9067</ol>
          <ol class="text">Call to make payments: 1-866-901-3212 (option 1)</ol>

          <ol class="text">Pay in person at certain LCSA offices or any MoneyGram location. </ol>
          <ol class="text">To find an LCSA office that accepts payments, call 1-866-901-3212 or visit <a href="http://www.childsup.ca.gov/Home/LCSAOffices.aspx">www.childsup.ca.gov/offices</a>.</ol>
          <ol class="text">To find a MoneyGram location, call 1-800-926-9400 or visit <a href="https://www.moneygram.com/WCM/groups/webcontent/documents/content/locator_main_file.html">www.MoneyGram.com/Locations</a>. Use Receive Code 14630 to make a California child support payment. (Note: MoneyGram will charge an additional fee for making your payment.)</ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>Note:</em> You may need your child support <em>Participant ID</em> number and/or your social security number when you make a payment.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If the LCSA is not involved in your case, you must make payments directly to the other parent (or caregiver)—unless you are told otherwise.</ol>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintKeep Records of Your Payments!</h4>
          <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! Whether you are making your payments to the California SDU or directly to the other parent, it’s a good idea to <em>always keep a record of every payment you make</em>. You can keep a separate notebook where you write down the <em>date</em> and <em>amount</em> of each payment, or make notes on a calendar every time you make a payment (including the date and amount).</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint	I lost my job or went to jail and cannot afford my child support payments!	</h4>
          <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! If you cannot pay or are falling behind on your child support payments because you lost your job, went to jail, or some other important changes have happened, it’s recommended that you<em> immediately</em> contact the LCSA and/or family court and ask to change your child support amount. Don’t wait! You are responsible for paying the full amount of child support until the LSCA or judge changes the child support order. For more information about changing your child support order, see Appendix K, PG. 1014.</p>
