  <p>
    What benefits and services can I get through CalWORKs?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can get cash assistance, employment services, and other benefits.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ABOUT THE 48-MONTH LIMIT
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This 48-month limit is a lifetime limit. In special situations, you can keep getting cash aid for longer. Contact your county CalWORKs office for details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Cash assistance: CalWORKs provides monthly cash aid to help pay for basic needs such as housing, food, utilities, clothing, and medical care. Your monthly aid (“grant level”) is based on two factors:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your family size: Generally, if you have a larger family, you’ll qualify for more cash aid; and if you have a smaller family, you’ll qualify for less.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Where you live: Generally, if you live in an urban county (“Region I”) where living costs are higher, you’ll qualify for more cash aid; and if you live in a rural county (“Region II”), you’ll qualify for less.[1363]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Generally, parents or caretakers can get CalWORKs cash aid for up to 48 months. But in many cases, a child in the family can keep getting cash aid after the 48 months are up.[1364]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Employment services: CalWORKs provides job training and job counseling services through a program called Welfare-to-Work (WTW).[1365] For more information about Welfare-to-Work, see PG. 555.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other benefits: Depending on your situation and what your county provides, you may qualify for other benefits through CalWORKs, such as: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CalFresh (also called “food stamps,” see PG. 522 for more information)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Medi-Cal (see PG. 538 for more information)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Child care services
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Family planning services
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Child health and disability prevention (CHDP) services
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Homeless and housing assistance
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Emergency cash aid
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Child support enforcement.[1366]
