<p>
  COURT-ORDERED DEBT
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>
  The COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER gives a basic overview of court-ordered debt to help you understand the money you may owe because of your past court involvement. You will learn the different kinds of court-ordered debt, what happens to these debts while you are incarcerated, and how these debts can affect you when you return to the community.
</p>

<p>
  DISCLAIMER – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the Roadmap to Reentry legal guide, it is your responsibility to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The Roadmap to Reentry guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.

  INTRODUCTION
</p>

<p>
  Many people coming home from prison or jail are surprised to find that they owe lots of money to various courts, agencies, and people. The money you owe can make it very hard to get back on your feet, which can leave you feeling frustrated and discouraged. 
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, this Chapter includes a lot of BAD NEWS about court-ordered debt because most of the laws that control court-ordered debt are NOT in your favor. However, reentry advocates—and even some politicians— who realize that this kind of debt harms not only formerly incarcerated people who are trying to start over, but also the communities they are returning to, are working to change these laws. In the meantime, this Chapter will give you some important information to help you better understand your rights, responsibilities, and opportunities when it comes to managing money that you owe due to your past court involvement (referred to in the rest of the Chapter as “court-ordered debt”).
</p>

<p>
  What is court-ordered debt and why do I need to know about it? 
</p>

<p>
  Court-ordered debt is money that you may owe because of some involvement you had with the criminal justice system—whether you were convicted, acquitted, your charges were dismissed, or you were only ever arrested. You may owe this money to the court itself, to the county or other government agency, to a victim of your crime, or even to a collection agency. 
</p>

<p>
  If you were convicted of a crime, you most likely owe court-related costs, or owed them at one point. But even if you were never convicted of anything, the court can still make you pay other fees, such as jail booking fees, public defender fees, and fees associated with minor offenses called infractions. It is important that you know about and understand any court-ordered debt you owe, because this debt can make it difficult for you to move forward with your life in many different ways. 
</p>

<p>
  I’ve never received anything telling me that I owe money; so I must not have any court-ordered debt, right? 
</p>

<p>
  Absolutely not! People move; paperwork gets lost in the mail; and addresses get written down incorrectly all the time. Just because you haven’t heard anything, doesn’t mean that you’re in the clear. Remember, if you have had any involvement with the criminal justice system, especially if you have a conviction, you were most likely ordered to pay money of some kind at some point. If you don’t take steps to find out about and take care of your debt, there could be serious consequences. 
</p>

<p>
  Even if you are 100% positive that you have paid off your debt entirely, mistakes can be made. Your payments may not have been properly recorded, or your name could be attached to someone else’s debt! It is better to check and be safe than to assume and be sorry. 
</p>

<p>
  What are the different types of court ordered debt? 
</p>

<p>
  There are three main types of court-ordered debt: (1) restitution; (2) fines and penalties; and (3) administrative fees. (You may also have debt from unpaid traffic fines and tickets. These are discussed later in this Chapter, on PG. 827). It can be hard to keep track of the different types of debt; this chart gives an overview of the important information about each one.

</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE NAMES & PURPOSES OF COURT-ORDERED DEBTS: The names for different types of court-ordered debt can be confusing. The chart above tries to explain the four basic types of court-ordered debt, but the names you see on your actual court paperwork and “sentencing order” may be different. For example, sometimes the same word (for example, “fee” or “assessment”) is used to mean different things by different courts in different counties. If you have any questions about your court-ordered debts and what they mean, ask your public defender or the lawyer who represented you in your case.Because each type of court-ordered debt has a different purpose, you will probably owe many different types of debt (restitution, fines, and fees) even if you have only one conviction. If you have more than one conviction, you will likely owe separate sets of court-ordered debt for each conviction.
