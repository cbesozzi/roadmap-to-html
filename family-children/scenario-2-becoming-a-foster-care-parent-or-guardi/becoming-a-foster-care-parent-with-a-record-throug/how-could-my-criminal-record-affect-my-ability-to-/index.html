          <p class="text">Your past conviction(s) <em>may</em> prevent you from becoming a foster parent.</p>
          <p class="text">If you want to become a child’s foster care parent through the dependency court, your criminal record will be a factor both in (1) your ability to get the required <em>state license</em> from the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to be a foster parent AND (2) whether the dependency court judge decides that it is in the<em> “best interest of the child” </em>for you to be their foster parent.<sup><a href="#footnote-2399" id="footnote-ref-2399">[2367]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">For a list of convictions the WILL or MAY prevent you from becoming a foster parent, see PG. 894</ol>
          <ol class="text">For more information on what a dependency court judge looks at when deciding what is in the “best interest of a child,” see PG. 906</ol>
          <p class="text">Before you apply for a foster care license, get a complete record of your convictions. This is important so that you can make sure that your record is correct and so that you can begin, if possible, dismissing convictions from your record if possible.</p>
          <p class="text">For information on cleaning up your record, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER on PG. 1132.</p>
