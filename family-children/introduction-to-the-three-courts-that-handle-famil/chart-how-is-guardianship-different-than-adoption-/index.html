They can ask for reasonable contact with the child.The judge in court can end a guardianship if the parents become able to take care of the child<em>.</em>Guardians can be supervised by the court.</ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">An adoption is awarded when:The parents' rights are permanently ended.The legal relationship with the adoptive parents is permanent and is exactly the same as a birth family.An adopted child inherits from his or her adoptive parents, just as a birth child would.Adoptive families are not supervised by the court.</ul></td><td><ul class="learn-bullets">Foster case happens when:The parents’ rights are temporarily transferred to the state but parents may be able to see the child if CPS grants permission. A judge can end a foster care placement if CPS determines that the parent(s) can take care of the child or a relative/caregiver gets guardianship or adopts the child. Foster parents are completely supervised and licensed by the state. </ul></td></tr></table>
