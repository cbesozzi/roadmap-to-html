  <p>
    How do I get my federal (FBI) RAP sheet?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have ever been arrested or had a conviction in another state, or for a federal offense, you will want to get a copy of your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your “Identity History Summary.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two ways to get a copy of your FBI RAP sheet:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI; OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can use a special private company, called a “Channeler,” that has contracted with the FBI to perform this service.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: It is generally faster to go through an FBI Channeler, but it is likely to be more expensive because these companies usually charge extra fees.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Whether you request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI or go through a channeler, you will need to fill out the FBI’s “Applicant Information Form” and get fingerprinted by a Live Scan service provider. For a step-by-step explanation of how to get your FBI RAP sheet, see APPENDIX D, on PG. 1215. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For more information about getting your RAP directly from the FBI, visit the FBI’s website at: http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/faqs
  </p>
  
  <p>
    REMINDER: Why is it important to get a copy of my background check? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To correct any errors, such as incomplete or incorrect information;To find out what other people are likely to see about you (employers, private landlords, government agencies, etc.);To be better prepared to answer questions about your criminal history (on job and housing applications, in job interviews, etc.); ANDTo protect your rights and maximize your chances of success!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For more information about getting your FBI RAP sheet through an FBI-approved channeler, see http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/fbi-approved-channelers
