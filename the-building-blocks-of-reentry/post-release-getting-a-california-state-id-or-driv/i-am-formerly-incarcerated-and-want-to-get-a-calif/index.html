  <p>
    I am formerly incarcerated and want to get a California Driver License. How do I apply?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Below are 3 charts that explain detailed steps for getting your California driver license after your release. Go to the chart appropriate for your situation:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (A) “I’ve never had a driver license, but I want one.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (B) “I used to have a driver license, but it expired.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (C) “I used to have a driver license, but it’s from another state.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Beginning January 1, 2015, under a new state law, if you cannot prove legal presence in the United States, you can get a driver license ONLY as proof of your right to drive,[91] not as official ID. Under the new law, you will need: (1) proof of identity, and (2) proof of California residency. See Appendix HG, PG. 122 a full list of acceptable documents to prove your identity and residency.[92]
