  <p>
    Am I eligible for GA/GR?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Helpful HintWhat’s the difference betweenGeneral Assistance (GA)/General Relief (GR) & CalWORKS?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    General Assistance/General Relief is designed to assist needy single adults. The typical General Assistance/General Relief recipient is a low-income single person who has limited resources and does not receive any other Public Benefits. The typical CalWORKS recipients are low-income families with minor children who may also receive other Public Benefits.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In general, to be able to get General Assistance/General Relief, you must: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be at least age 18 (unless you are an emancipated foster child denied aid through CalWORKs);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be a resident of the county where you’re applying;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Be a U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resident, or an immigrant with satisfactory status; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have a Social Security Number (a card is not necessary); and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have limited income and property.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every county has its own rules, including specific limits on the income and property you can have. Contact your county welfare agency for more details. For a list of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A on PG. 634.[1339] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When applying for GA/GR, you should bring whatever form of identification you have. If you do not have any ID, the social worker at the county welfare agency should be able to help you in proving your identity. Some counties also require a fingerprint be taken before benefits can be distributed. For information about applying for a California state ID card for free or reduced price, see the BUILDING BLOCKS IN REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, on PG. 48. If you have more questions about applying for GA/GR, you may call the following nonprofit organizations: Public Interest Law Project (PILP) at (510) 891-9794 or the Western Center on Law and Poverty (WCLP) at (213) 487-7211, for advice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can my criminal history limit my ability to get GA/GR? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe. Some counties have special rules and restrictions for people with drug-related criminal convictions or other violations, or for people who are suspected of having a warrant, being in violation of parole or probation, or fleeing to avoid prosecution for a crime. Contact your county welfare agency to ask about its local policy. For a directory of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A, PG. 634.[1340] If you believe that your county welfare agency is wrongly or unlawfully denying GA/GR benefits to you, you may call the following nonprofit organizations: Public Interest Law Project (PILP) at (510) 891-9794 or the Western Center on Law and Poverty (WCLP) at (213) 487-7211, for advice.
