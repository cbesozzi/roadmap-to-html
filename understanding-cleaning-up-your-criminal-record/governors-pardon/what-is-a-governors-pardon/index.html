          <h1>What is a Governor‚Äôs pardon?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153951"></a>What is a Governor‚Äôs pardon?</h3>
          <p class="text">A governor‚Äôs pardon is an official forgiveness for your conviction, granted by the Governor of California. A pardon can potentially restore all of the rights you lost due to your conviction‚Äîincluding your gun rights and your right to serve on a jury‚Äîas well as eliminate your requirement to register as a sex offender. It is the best thing you can do to reduce the impact of your criminal record on your life, but it is still not a complete remedy because it does not make it as if the conviction never happened. (For more information on what a pardon does and does NOT do for you, see PG.¬†1189.) </p>
          <p class="text">A California Governor‚Äôs pardon is an honor traditionally granted only to individuals who have demonstrated exemplary behavior following conviction for a felony.‚Äù<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3117" id="footnote-ref-3117">[3081]</a></sup></sup> A pardon by the Governor is an official acknowledgement of your rehabilitation, by the state‚Äôs highest elected official. A Governor‚Äôs pardon provides significant relief from the collateral civil consequences of a criminal conviction. Both the California Penal Code and the California Constitution give the Governor the authority to grant a pardon, and that authority is entirely discretionary.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3118" id="footnote-ref-3118">[3082]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">Unfortunately, Governor‚Äôs pardons are difficult to get and are NOT granted very often, so you should try to clean up your record using other remedies first‚Äîsuch as an expungement or a Certificate of Rehabilitation. </p>
          <h4 class="textbox">Governor‚Äôs Pardons vs.<br/> Felony Reductions, Reclassifications &amp; Resentencing</h4>
          <p class="textbox">In most cases, you are NOT eligible for a Governor‚Äôs pardon if you ONLY have misdemeanor convictions on your criminal record. (In other words, you must have a felony conviction to get a pardon.) If you reduce your felony conviction to a misdemeanor under California Penal Code section 17(b) (see PG.¬†1174), or have it reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop 47 (see PG.¬†1178), you could become ineligible for a Governor‚Äôs pardon (unless you also have other felony convictions on your record). HOWEVER, in most cases it‚Äôs still better to have your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor‚Äîeven if that makes you ineligible for a Governor‚Äôs pardon‚Äîfor these reasons:</p>
          <ul class="textbox">It is MUCH easier to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor than it is to get a Governor‚Äôs pardon. Governor‚Äôs pardons are very rare, and you should not count on getting one.Getting your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor removes the felony from your criminal record and allows you to say that you were never convicted of a felony for that offense. But a Governor‚Äôs pardon does NOT remove, erase, or seal the conviction on your record, so you will still have to disclose that you have a felony conviction even if you have been pardoned.</ul>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If your conviction is eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, you should absolutely apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation <em>first</em>, BEFORE seeking a pardon. Getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation almost ensures your chance of getting a pardon AND will automatically serve as your application for one (so you will not have to do anything else to apply!)</p>
