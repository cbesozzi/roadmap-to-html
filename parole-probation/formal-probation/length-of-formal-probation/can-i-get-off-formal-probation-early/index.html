          <h3><a id="_Toc448152888"></a>Can I get off formal probation early?</h3>
          <p class="text">Possibly. California law allows you to ask the court to be released early from your probation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-655" id="footnote-ref-655">[630]</a></sup></sup> If you have completed all of the conditions of your probation (for example, paid all fines/fees, completed all counseling) and you are at least halfway through your probation term (for example, 1 ½ years through a 3-year probation term), you may be a good candidate to have your probation ended early. The process for terminating (ending) formal probation early is the same as the process for ending informal probation or Mandatory Supervision early. If your request (called a “Motion”) to end your formal probation early is granted by the judge, then you might also be able to ask for certain convictions to be dismissed from your record! For more information on how to file a Motion to Terminate Probation early, and also how to request dismissals of eligible convictions, please see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132.</p>
          <h3 class="subheading2"> <a id="_Toc448152889"></a>Conditions of Formal Probation</h3>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: It is important to know the conditions of your probation because, if you do not follow the terms and conditions of your formal probation, your probation could be revoked and you could:</p>
          <ul class="importantbox">Be sent to jail, or go to prison (where the court had earlier suspended a prison sentence by granting you formal probation);<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-656" id="footnote-ref-656">[631]</a></sup></strong> Be sentenced to the maximum sentence authorized for the crime you were convicted of;Have additional terms, such as public works service (“PWS” or “volunteer works”) or community service added to your probation;<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-657" id="footnote-ref-657">[632]</a></sup></strong>Have your probation revoked, and reinstated, for a new period of three-five years<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-658" id="footnote-ref-658">[633]</a></sup></strong> (see PG. 228 on probation revocation proceedings). </ul>
