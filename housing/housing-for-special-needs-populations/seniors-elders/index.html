          <p class="text">Although there are very few housing programs created just for senior citizens in reentry, you may be eligible for housing based on you disability (see PG. 480), your low income (see PG. 394), or qualify for different types of transitional housing (see PG. 382).</p>
          <p class="text">One program for seniors in reentry is the Senior Ex-Offender Program (SEOP) at the Bayview-Hunters Point Senior Center in San Francisco, CA. It currently provides temporary and transitional housing and is developing a permanent housing facility for the future.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1110" id="footnote-ref-1110">[1084]</a></sup></sup></span> Other transitional housing programs for seniors—particularly low-income housing, homelessness prevention, and sober or residential treatment programs for seniors—may be more likely to admit seniors with criminal records because the conviction was long ago or you have physical or health needs that give you priority for the housing (it may help to mention these factors if the housing provider raises your record as an issue).</p>
