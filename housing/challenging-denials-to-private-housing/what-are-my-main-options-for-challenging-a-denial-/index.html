  <h3><a id="_Toc448153224"></a>What are my main options for challenging a denial to private housing?</h3>
  
  <ol class="text">Blanket bans against all people with criminal records</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Treating your criminal record differently than others (arbitrary discrimination)</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Landlord violated your right to notice of a background check, and your right to fix errors (go to PG. 426)</ol>
  
  <p class="text">Go to Appendix H, PG. 493 to learn about how to file a discrimination complaint with a government agency. Try to get a lawyer to help if you can. See PG. 1286 of this guide for a list of legal aid providers across California.</p>
  
  <p class="text">As a summary, your main options for challenging an illegal denial from private housing are the following:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">You could file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency);</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">You could file an administrative complaint with HUD (the federal housing protection agency);</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">You could file a civil lawsuit in state or federal court; OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">You could allow HUD (the federal housing agency) or California’s DFEH (the state housing agency) to file a lawsuit on your behalf.</ol>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153225"></a>How do I figure out which option to choose if I want to challenge a denial from private housing? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">Talk to a lawyer or an advocate at a nonprofit legal services organization if possible—they can help advise you! Also, you can always file a complaint with <em>both</em> HUD &amp; DFEH, but talking to a lawyer is important. More on each of these 3 options below.</p>
  
  <p class="text">For general instructions on how to file a complaint against a private landlord, go to Appendix H, PG. 493.</p>
