          <h3><a id="_Toc448153928"></a>What is a ‚Äúwobbler‚Äù and why is it important for expungement?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you were convicted of a felony, but were NOT sentenced to a state prison term (or county jail under California‚Äôs Realignment Act), your offense is called a ‚Äúwobbler.‚Äù A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as <em>either</em> a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense ‚Äúwobbles‚Äù between the two offense categories. You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by reading the California Penal Code section that is listed on your RAP sheet. If it says that the offense is punishable by a fine or time in the county jail (misdemeanor sentences) OR time in state prison or ‚Äúimprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-3005" id="footnote-ref-3005">[2971]</a></sup> (felony sentence), your offense is considered a wobbler.<sup><a href="#footnote-3006" id="footnote-ref-3006">[2972]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">Remember, felony ‚Äúwobblers‚Äù are eligible for reduction and ultimately expungement if:<sup><a href="#footnote-3007" id="footnote-ref-3007">[2973]</a></sup> </p>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to prison time for the offense; </ol>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to county jail instead of prison</ol>
          <ol class="text">under Realignment;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG.¬†1165); AND</ol>
          <ol class="text">You otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for more information on these requirements, see PG.¬†1164). </ol>
          <p class="text">For more information on expunging a felony ‚Äúwobbler‚Äù conviction, see PG.¬†1165.</p>
          <p class="text">Although the law does not require you to be off probation, you will have a better chance of getting your conviction reduced if you have successfully completed probation first. For information on how to get off probation early, see PG. 1172.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Felonies that CANNOT be reduced to misdemeanors. If you were sentenced to state prison OR sentenced to county jail for a straight felony under Realignment‚Äîeven if the judge suspended your sentence so you never spent any time in custody‚Äîyour conviction is NOT eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3008" id="footnote-ref-3008">[2974]</a></sup></strong></p>
          <p class="text">However, if you <em>never spent any time in prison</em> and you were not sentenced to county jail instead of prison because of Realignment, you may still qualify to have your felony conviction expunged (see PG.¬†1165).<sup><a href="#footnote-3009" id="footnote-ref-3009">[2975]</a></sup></p>
