    How much will it cost to earn an Associate Degree?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Comparing Types of Associate Degrees:AA/AS may be right for you if…AAA/AAS may be right for you if…You want to go on to earn a bachelor’s degree;You want a college degree;You want to transfer your credits to a 4-year college or university;You want a college degree;You want to sharpen your academic skills;You want to get into the workforce sooner;You want to get into the workforce soonerYou want to get into the workforce
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The cost of earning an Associate degree varies greatly depending on the institution that you enroll in.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In California, public community colleges are among the most economical choices for earning a college degree. Technically, there is no tuition, however, there are enrollment fees that are charged per credit-unit that you take.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At the time of publication, the enrollment fee for California residents is $46 per credit-unit.[2764]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This per-unit enrollment fee is for California residents and is the same for all public community colleges across the state. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Full-time enrollment is generally 12 credit-units per week (1 credit-unit = 1hour of class time), but you can take more or less if you like. (You may be eligible for a waiver of this fee, see PG. 1088 for information on waiving community college enrollment fees.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Private community colleges and four-year colleges are the most expensive options (costs vary greatly, but may be several thousands of dollars). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Tuition or per-unit fees do not include other costs associated with enrolling in a college program such as books, school supplies, and transportation.
