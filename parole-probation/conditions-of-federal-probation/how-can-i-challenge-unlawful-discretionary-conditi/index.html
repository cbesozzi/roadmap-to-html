        <h3><a id="_Toc448152994"></a>How can I challenge unlawful discretionary conditions that were added on to my federal probation?</h3>
        <p>Within 14 days of your sentencing hearing, you must file a Notice of Appeal with the Clerk of the Court where you were convicted.<sup><a href="#footnote-821" id="footnote-ref-821">[795]</a></sup> Once this occurs, you should contact the Federal Public Defender’s Office in your federal judicial district. For a list of Federal Public Defender’s Offices in California, visit: <a href="http://www.fd.org/docs/defender-contacts/federal-public-and-community-defender-directory.pdf?sfvrsn=9">http://www.fd.org/docs/defender-contacts/federal-public-and-community-defender-directory.pdf?sfvrsn=9.</a> </p>
        <p><em>NOTE: The same rules and processes apply for challenging discretionary conditions of Supervised Release as for federal probation (refer back to PG. 106 for challenging conditions of federal probation.)</em></p>
