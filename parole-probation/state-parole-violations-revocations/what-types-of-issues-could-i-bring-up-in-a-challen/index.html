          <h3><a id="_Toc448152854"></a>What types of issues could I bring up in a challenge to parole revocation proceedings, decisions, or actions?</h3>
          <p>There are many types of issues that you can raise in a challenge to a revocation proceeding or decision. For this reason, we recommend that you speak with your attorney if you believe that your rights have been violated! Your claim could be based on violations of state or federal constitutional due process rights, California or federal statutes, or California administrative rules. For example, you could argue that:</p>
          <ol class="text">The revocation hearing is being unreasonably delayed;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were denied the right to cross-examine witnesses at the parole revocation hearing; or </ol>
          <ol class="text">The evidence did not support the revocation decision.</ol>
          <p>UNFORTUNATELY—in most cases, the process for raising such challenges will be too slow to provide you any relief before you have served the entire parole revocation sentence term. BUT You may still benefit by:</p>
          <ol class="text">Getting your parole revocation cases re-heard;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Getting their revocations vacated; and/or </ol>
          <ol class="text">Getting the time served for the revocation deducted from the controlling parole discharge date.</ol>
