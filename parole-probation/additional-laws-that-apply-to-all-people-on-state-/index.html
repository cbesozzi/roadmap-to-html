          <h1>Additional Laws That Apply to All People on State Parole</h1>
          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448152809"></a>Additional Laws That Apply to All People on State Parole</h2>
          <p><em>In addition to general conditions, there are other laws that impact the civil rights of all people on state parole. These won’t be listed on your CDCR Form 1515: Notice and Conditions of Parole (the form your parole agent gives you upon release), but they are just as important.</em></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152810"></a>What other laws &amp; restrictions apply to all people on state parole?</h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS UPDATE!</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Recently, the California Supreme Court ruled that this voting ban applies only to people incarcerated in state prison (or in jail awaiting transfer to serve state prison sentences) and people on state parole. It does NOT apply to people otherwise incarcerated in jail, or to people on county-level probation, including mandatory supervision or post-release community supervision (PRCS). (<em>See </em>Scott et al. v. Bowen (2015).) This is a brand new ruling that extended voting rights to many more people in California! Read more on PG. 83 of the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER.</p>
          <p class="text">Additional laws and restrictions that apply to you and all people on state parole are:</p>
          <ol class="text">YOU CANNOT VOTE — In California, people who are on parole (or currently incarcerated) may not vote in any elections.<sup><a href="#footnote-449" id="footnote-ref-449">[431]</a></sup> Outside of California, people with felony convictions may vote in some elections but not others. Voting laws vary by state, so if you ever move to a new state, you should look into that state’s voting requirements. (To learn more about voting rights in California, and to see a chart of who can vote based on the supervision they’re on, go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 83.)</ol>
          <ol class="text">YOU CANNOT SERVE ON A JURY — In California, people with felony convictions cannot serve on juries, even after they have been discharged from parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-450" id="footnote-ref-450">[432]</a></sup> This means you may not be able to serve on a jury for the rest of your life (unless the law changes).</ol>
          <p><strong>Is there any way to get back my right to serve on a jury?</strong></p>
          <p class="address">Yes. You may be able to restore your right to serve on a jury in California. Depending on your situation, you might be able to:</p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Have your felony reduced to a misdemeanor (misdemeanors don’t prevent you from serving on a jury in California); or</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Apply for a Cer</strong><a id="certofrehabilitation"></a><strong>tificate of Rehabilitation (COR), which automatically includes an application for a Governor’s Pardon. A COR won’t restore your right to serve on a jury, but a Governor’s Pardon will.</strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong>Apply directly for a Governor’s Pardon, which will restore your right to serve on a jury.<sup><a href="#footnote-451" id="footnote-ref-451">[433]</a></sup></strong></p>
          <p class="listparagraph"><strong><em>(For more information on all three of these possible remedies, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132.)</em></strong></p>
          <ol class="text">YOU CANNOT BE ON PRISON GROUNDS WITHOUT APPROVAL — In California, it is a crime for a former prisoner to be on prison grounds for any reason without the warden’s prior approval.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-452" id="footnote-ref-452">[434]</a></sup></sup> To obtain permission to visit, you must get written approval from your parole agent and send it to the warden, along with a letter requesting the warden’s permission and a completed visiting questionnaire (CDCR Form 106, see Appendix O, PG. 323).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-453" id="footnote-ref-453">[435]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <h4 class="textbox">GENERAL VS. SPECIAL CONDITIONSAside from the general conditions of parole, are there other special conditions that could be imposed on me?</h4>
          <p class="textbox">Yes. There are <em>discretionary</em> special conditions that your parole agent can impose on you as long as these conditions meet certain legal standards (see PG. 290). There are also <em>mandatory</em> special conditions that are imposed on certain categories of individuals, as required by California state law. Continue reading below for more information about special conditions. </p>
          <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448152811"></a>Special Conditions of State Parole: Conditions that apply ONLY to certain People on parole</h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">DO YOU THINK THAT A special PAROLE CONDITION IS VIOLATING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Go to PG. 188 to learn how to challenge a parole condition, which you can do either from prison or when you are out in the community.</p>
          <p class="text">Sometimes, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) or a parole agent may impose special parole conditions that add EXTRA limitations to a person’s life. This section explains when special conditions may be applied, and what rights you have against these conditions.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448152812"></a>Who sets special parole conditions, and how do they decide?</h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">CAN I ASK FOR MY SUPERVISION LEVEL TO BE REVIEWED or REDUCED?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Yes. Most parolees who complete 180 days of satisfactory parole will automatically be assigned to the “minimum supervision” category — EXCEPT for people whose commitment offense is legally classified as “violent” (<em>see</em> Cal. Penal Code § 667.5); 290 registrants (<em>see</em> Cal. Penal Code § 290); people with cases that received a lot of media or public attention, and certain gang members (as documented on CDCR Form 812-A). Even if you are not automatically assigned to “minimum supervision” after 180 days of completing satisfactory parole, you can ask the unit supervisor to reduce your supervision level, and he or she will make a decision on your case. (Cal. Penal Code § 3504.)</p>
          <p class="text">The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and individual parole agents can require you to follow certain <em>special conditions</em>, which are <em>special rules</em> you must follow while on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-454" id="footnote-ref-454">[436]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">If you are a “lifer” in California, or if you were released onto parole before July 1, 2013, or if you were charged with a parole violation before July 1, 2013,<sup><a href="#footnote-455" id="footnote-ref-455">[437]</a></sup> then the BPH can require you to follow certain special parole conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-456" id="footnote-ref-456">[438]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">If you are not a “lifer,” county Superior Court judges are in charge of handling your parole conditions and revocations of your parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-457" id="footnote-ref-457">[439]</a></sup> Superior Court judges may impose special parole conditions, but these special conditions must be “reasonably related” to your commitment offense (the offense for which you spent time in prison), your “criminogenic needs” (issues that affect your risk of recidivism, such as substance abuse, family ties, and social relationships), and your criminal history.<sup><a href="#footnote-458" id="footnote-ref-458">[440]</a></sup> </p>
          <p><em>Special conditions</em> required by CDCR and/or your parole agent will depend on your individual circumstances, including your commitment offense<em>,</em> your criminogenic needs, your criminal history,<sup><a href="#footnote-459" id="footnote-ref-459">[441]</a></sup> specific conditions required by law (called <em>mandatory</em> special condititions — see the box below for more information), and other parole expectations. Your <em>special conditions</em> will be part of your parole plan, and they can change depending on how well you do on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-460" id="footnote-ref-460">[442]</a></sup> (See the next question to learn about what your parole plan is.)</p>

            <article>
            <h3><a href="/roadmap-to-html/parole-probation/additional-laws-that-apply-to-all-people-on-state-/what-is-my-parole-plan/">What is my parole plan?</a></h3>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448152813"></a>What is my parole plan?</h3>
              <p class="text">Your parole plan is an individualized plan to guide your supervision, which DAPO staff will prepare before your release, based on an individual evaluation of your strengths, needs, risk factors, and overall risk of reoffending. Your parole plan will include information identified in your evaluation —your strengths, needs, risk factors, and overall risk of reoffending — as well as goals for your successful reentry; “triggers” that may lead to negative behavior; strategies for avoiding “triggers”; special parole conditions; and your supervision category.<sup><a href="#footnote-461" id="footnote-ref-461">[443]</a></sup> Your supervision category is based on DAPO’s initial evaluation of your risk of reoffending, as well as your progress while on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-462" id="footnote-ref-462">[444]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text">You should receive a copy of your parole plan before you are released. While you are on parole, you should be meeting regularly with your parole agent to review your parole plan, your progress with specific goals and strategies, and other issues. Your parole agent will modify (adjust) your parole plan based on your progress and other changes in your situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-463" id="footnote-ref-463">[445]</a></sup> Your parole agent should also review your supervision category periodically to determine whether it should be changed.<sup><a href="#footnote-464" id="footnote-ref-464">[446]</a></sup> </p>
              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Victims and witnesses of your crime can ask for special parole conditions to be imposed on you, including no-contact provisions and/or requirements that you are not paroled to the county where they live (for more information, see PG. 195).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-465" id="footnote-ref-465">[447]</a></sup></strong> BPH and CDCR also commonly impose special no-contact provisions for crime partners, which would prevent you from contacting/seeing anyone who was your co-defendant in your criminal case. Lastly, state law requires special conditions for certain categories of people — these are called <em>mandatory </em>special conditions.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-466" id="footnote-ref-466">[448]</a></sup></strong> Specifically, there are <em>mandatory</em> special conditions for “sex offenders” (see PG. 182) and for “mentally disordered offenders” (see PG. 187).<strong> </strong></p>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448152814"></a>What are common examples of special parole conditions? </h3>
              <p class="text">The most common special conditions for a person on state parole are:</p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You cannot drink alcohol; </strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You must submit to drug testing; or</strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>You must participate in mental health treatment.<sup><a href="#footnote-467" id="footnote-ref-467">[449]</a></sup> </strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>GPS DEVI</strong><a id="gpsSTATEparole"></a><strong>CES — Some people on parole will be required to wear GPS tracking devices (usually ankle monitors). It is the CDCR’s policy to require GPS monitoring for: </strong></p>
              <ol class="text">Any parolee validated as a member or associate of a prison gang, street gang, or “disruptive group”;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Any parolee placed on “high control” supervision; </ol>
              <ol class="text">Any parolee with a history of being unavailable for supervision, absconding (going missing), escalating parole violations, or other such factors indicating the parolee is likely to commit another crime; and</ol>
              <ol class="text">Any parolee required by the BPH to have a GPS monitoring condition.<sup><a href="#footnote-468" id="footnote-ref-468">[450]</a></sup> Failure to wear the GPS device or to keep it charged is a violation of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-469" id="footnote-ref-469">[451]</a></sup> Parolees can be required to pay for the cost of the GPS if they are able to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-470" id="footnote-ref-470">[452]</a></sup></ol>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448152815"></a>When will I find out the conditions of my parole, including any special conditions that apply to me?</h3>
              <h4 class="sidebox">REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h4>
              <p class="sidebox">Your parole may be revoked for 6 months if you (1) refuse to give any required DNA sample prior to release, or (2) refuse to sign any documents acknowledging a duty to register as a sex offender. (<em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code § 3060.5). </p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>WHILE INCARCERATED:</strong></p>
              <p>You should find out about the conditions of your parole <em>at least 45 days</em> before your release. Your correctional counselor should provide you with this information in a CDCR Form 1515: Notice and Conditions of Parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-471" id="footnote-ref-471">[453]</a></sup> You will be asked to sign the Form 1515.<sup><a href="#footnote-472" id="footnote-ref-472">[454]</a></sup> You will also be given a copy of the Form 1515 for you to keep upon your release. </p>
              <p>Even if you don't agree with a special condition listed in the Form 1515, it is usually best to sign the Form 1515 and comply with the conditions while at the same time taking steps to challenge any disputed condition. If you don't sign the form, you might not get out of prison until the matter is resolved.<sup><a href="#footnote-473" id="footnote-ref-473">[455]</a></sup> </p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>ONCE YOU’RE RELEASED:</strong></p>
              <p>When you are out and you first meet with your parole agent, he or she should give you a copy of your Form 1515 to keep, and he or she should explain ALL the general and special conditions of your parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-474" id="footnote-ref-474">[456]</a></sup> It is important that you fully understand your parole conditions. If you do not understand some or all of them, ask your parole agent to clear up your questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>If your parole agent doesn’t present you with the Form 1515 in your first meeting, you should ask him or her to do so. Again, it is very important that your parole agent explains to you all your conditions of parole — and if he or she does not do so, you should ask.</p>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448152816"></a>Do I have any legal protections against unfair special parole conditions? </h3>
              <p>Yes. A parole condition is invalid if it fails one of the following 4 legal tests:</p>
              <p><strong>TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if:</strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It has no relation to the commitment offense; </strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and </strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities.<sup><a href="#footnote-475" id="footnote-ref-475">[457]</a></sup> </strong></p>
              <p><em>For this test, you must show that the condition is invalid based on all three of these factors. </em></p>
              <p>For example: Courts have held that if a parolee has no history of alcohol abuse or committing crimes while intoxicated, alcohol testing cannot be imposed as a condition of parole because using alcohol (1) is unrelated to the parolee’s past criminal conduct, (2) is not illegal in itself, and (3) is not reasonably related to the parolee’s risk of future criminality.<sup><a href="#footnote-476" id="footnote-ref-476">[458]</a></sup></p>
              <p><strong>TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if:</strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND</strong></p>
              <p class="listparagraph"><strong>It is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.<sup><a href="#footnote-477" id="footnote-ref-477">[459]</a></sup> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>TEST 3: A parole condition may be invalid if </strong>it<strong> </strong>is excessively broad or so vague that you cannot understand or follow it.<sup><a href="#footnote-478" id="footnote-ref-478">[460]</a></sup> </p>
              <p>For example: If a parole condition prohibits you from associating with members of a certain group, then to be valid, it must include a requirement that you actually know (or should know) whether the people you’re associating with are members of the prohibited group.<sup><a href="#footnote-479" id="footnote-ref-479">[461]</a></sup></p>
              <p><strong>TEST 4: A parole condition is invalid if </strong>it<strong> </strong>limits the type of employment you can have, and this limitation does not directly relate to your crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-480" id="footnote-ref-480">[462]</a></sup> </p>
              <p>For example: If you were previously convicted for bouncing a check, a parole condition that forbids you from becoming a salesperson would be invalid.<sup><a href="#footnote-481" id="footnote-ref-481">[463]</a></sup></p>
