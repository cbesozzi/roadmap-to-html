          <h3><a id="_Toc448153421"></a>What rules must an employer follow if they decide not to hire me based on my record?</h3>
          <p class="text">Under, federal law (FCRA) the employer must notify you both before AND after taking any adverse (negative) action against you based on the results of your background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1820" id="footnote-ref-1820">[1790]</a></sup> </p>
          <h4>BEFORE ADVERSE ACTION:</h4>
          <p class="text">Before an employer takes any adverse action against you based on the results of your background check, the employer must give you a “Pre-Adverse Action” letter to notify you that it is planning to take the adverse action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1821" id="footnote-ref-1821">[1791]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">Under federal law, the Pre-Adverse Action letter must:</p>
          <ol class="text">NOTIFY you that the employer plans to take adverse action against you based on information from your background check report;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Include a COPY of your background check report that the employer used to make its decision,<sup><a href="#footnote-1822" id="footnote-ref-1822">[1792]</a></sup> and </ol>
          <ol class="text">Include the DOCUMENT, “A Summary of Your Rights Under FCRA”<sup><a href="#footnote-1823" id="footnote-ref-1823">[1793]</a></sup> (see Appendix I, PG. 786)</ol>
          <p class="text">After you receive this letter, you must be given a reasonable opportunity (about 5 days)<sup><a href="#footnote-1824" id="footnote-ref-1824">[1794]</a></sup> to review your report and correct any errors. </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you receive a “Pre-Adverse Action” letter, you should:</p>
          <ul class="importantbox">Review your background check report immediately to make sure it does not contain any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated information—such as convictions that are more than 7 years old; convictions that were dismissed/expunged/sealed; and/or arrests that did not lead to a conviction (as long as the charges are not still pending); Tell the employer immediately if there is any incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information in the report;Offer proof of errors in your background check report, such as court records showing the final disposition (outcome) of the case;Offer proof of your rehabilitation efforts, including certifications or documents that show completion of programs, school transcripts, letters of support from past employer or other community members (not family or friends).</ul>
          <p class="importantbox">If the employer does not give you enough time to review the report and correct any errors—for example, if the employer gives you the “Pre-Adverse Action” letter and then rejects your job application on the same day—you may have a legal claim against the employer for violating your right to receive notice before the adverse action.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1825" id="footnote-ref-1825">[1795]</a></sup></strong>IMPORTANT: Although the purpose of the Pre-Adverse Action law is to allow you to correct errors in your background check report, the law is NOT clear about whether the employer is required to reconsider your application if you correct the error and provide proof. If this happens to you, you should talk to an attorney about whether the employer may have violated your rights.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1826" id="footnote-ref-1826">[1796]</a></sup></strong> </p>
          <h4>AFTER ADVERSE ACTION</h4>
          <p class="text">After an employer takes any adverse action against you, such as rejecting your job application or firing you, the employer must give you an “<a id="EM_AdverseActionNotice"></a>Adverse Action Notice” to notify you that an adverse action was taken against you based on information from your background check. The employer can give you this notice orally, in writing, or electronically, but it must be within 3 business days of the employer’s final decision. </p>
          <p class="text">Under federal law, the Adverse Action Notice must include:</p>
          <ol class="text">The name, address, and phone number of the background check company that supplied the report to the employer;</ol>
          <ol class="text">A statement that the background check company that supplied the report is not responsible for the adverse action and cannot explain the specific reasons for the action; and </ol>
          <ol class="text">A statement of your rights to: </ol>
          <ol class="text">Dispute (challenge) the accuracy or completeness of any information the background check company provided; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Get an additional free report from the company within 60 days, if you ask for one.<sup><a href="#footnote-1827" id="footnote-ref-1827">[1797]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">The Adverse Action Notice is important so that you know why the employer made the adverse decision against you and what information the employer considered. This way you can challenge or correct any information that is incorrect, incomplete, or illegal. And if the employer or background check company has NOT followed any of the laws described here—or if the employer does NOT give you an Adverse Action Notice—you may have a legal claim against them. </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Adverse Action NoticesIf an employer takes an adverse action against you (such as not hiring you) based on information in your background check report, they must give you BOTH a Pre-Adverse Action AND Adverse Action Notice. If the employer does not give you these documents, you may have a legal claim against them for violating your rights under background check laws. However, you will need to show that they employer’s decision was actually based on information in your background check report (such as your criminal record) and NOT for other reasons. See the text box immediately below on <a id="EM_HH_ShowEmployersDecisionWasBasedOnRec"></a>PG. 716 for how to do this.</p>
          <p class="text">For more information on what you can do if an employer does NOT give you an Adverse Action Notice or does NOT follow any of the other laws described here, see PG. 715. </p>
          <p class="text">For more information on how to challenge or correct information in your background check report, see information below, or see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132. </p>
          <p class="text">For information on how to get a copy of your background check report, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132.</p>
