    How do I enroll in the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Call your local court. You can contact the superior court where you received your ticket(s) and ask about the Traffic Amnesty Program.[2209] Once you start the process by visiting your local court, the court will provide you with an application to enroll in the program; you will not have to see a judge.[2210] The court is then supposed to contact the DMV to notify them that you are enrolled in the program.[2211] To find the contact information for all superior courts in California, visit: http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    DMV PRINTOUT: While you wait, it may be helpful to get a printout from DMV of what’s causing your driver license suspension. Many of the details of how the application process will work have not yet been established by each county. While we wait for specific details, it is helpful to get a printout from the DMV that shows what is causing your license suspension.

    FOR MORE INFORMATION: Learn more about the Traffic Amnesty Program on this easy-to-use website about the program: http://www.backontheroadca.org/. You can also use this website to report any issues or complaints you are having with the program.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Talk to the traffic court clerk (or collection agency, if your traffic fines were sent to collections) about setting up a payment plan. Keep in mind that the payment plan may charge additional fees, as well as big penalties for missed payments—so make sure to ask about any fees and penalties before you sign up![2212]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can go back to court and ask the judge to reduce or forgive your traffic fines based on your inability to pay. (You can also do this at the time when the judge first orders you to pay the fines.) Either the judge or another county official will do an evaluation of your financial situation. Based on this evaluation, the judge will decide how much of your fines—if any—you will have to pay, and will set up a payment plan for you.[2213] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some counties have amnesty programs that can reduce the amount of debt you owe for overdue infraction and misdemeanor tickets.[2214] Contact the local traffic court to find out whether the county has an amnesty program and whether you are eligible.
