          <h3><a id="_Toc448153417"></a>Can an employer consider my credit history?</h3>
          <p class="text">Generally, no. Employers CANNOT look at your credit report unless you are applying for certain high level or sensitive job positions, such as a manager or supervisor within a company, a law enforcement officer, or a position with access to large amounts of cash and/or sensitive financial information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1794" id="footnote-ref-1794">[1764]</a></sup> If you have further questions about your credit history, contact a local legal service organization or call 2-1-1. </p>
          <h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSYour Rights If An Employer Runs A Background Check</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report.</ul>
