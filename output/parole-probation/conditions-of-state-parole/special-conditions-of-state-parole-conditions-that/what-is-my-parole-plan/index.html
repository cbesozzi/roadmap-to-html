          <h1>What is my parole plan?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc352861030"></a>What is my parole plan?</h3>
          <p class="text">Your parole plan is an individualized plan to guide your supervision, which DAPO staff will prepare before your release, based on an individual evaluation of your strengths, needs, risk factors, and overall risk of reoffending. Your parole plan will include information identified in your evaluation —your strengths, needs, risk factors, and overall risk of reoffending — as well as goals for your successful reentry; “triggers” that may lead to negative behavior; strategies for avoiding “triggers”; special parole conditions; and your supervision category.<sup><a href="#footnote-434" id="footnote-ref-434">[433]</a></sup> Your supervision category is based on DAPO’s initial evaluation of your risk of reoffending, as well as your progress while on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-435" id="footnote-ref-435">[434]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">You should receive a copy of your parole plan <em>before you are released</em>. While on parole, you should be meeting regularly with your parole agent to review your parole plan, progress with specific goals and strategies, and other issues. Your parole agent will adjust your parole plan based on your progress and other changes in your situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-436" id="footnote-ref-436">[435]</a></sup> S/he should also review your supervision category periodically to see if ti should be changed.<sup><a href="#footnote-437" id="footnote-ref-437">[436]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Victims and witnesses of your crime can ask for special parole conditions to be added to your parole, including no-contact provisions and/or requirements that you are not paroled to the county where they live (learn more on PG. 179).<sup><a href="#footnote-438" id="footnote-ref-438">[437]</a></sup> BPH and CDCR also commonly impose special no-contact provisions for crime partners, which would prevent you from contacting/seeing anyone who was your co-defendant in your criminal case. Lastly, state law requires special conditions for certain categories of people — these are called <em>mandatory </em>special conditions.<sup><a href="#footnote-439" id="footnote-ref-439">[438]</a></sup> Specifically, there are <em>mandatory</em> special conditions for “sex offenders” (see PG. 159) and for “mentally disordered offenders” (see PG. 172). </p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc352861031"></a>What are common examples of special parole conditions? </h3>
          <p class="text">The most common special conditions for a person on state parole are:</p>
          <ol class="text">You cannot drink alcohol; </ol>
          <ol class="text">You must submit to drug testing;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You must participate in mental health treatment.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-440" id="footnote-ref-440">[439]</a></sup></strong></ol>
          <ol class="text">You must wear a <strong>GPS deviI</strong><a id="gpsSTATEparole"></a><strong>ce</strong> — <em>Note that some people on parole will be required to wear GPS tracking devices (usually ankle monitors). It is the CDCR’s policy to require GPS monitoring for:</em> </ol>
          <ol class="text">Any parolee validated as a member or associate of a prison gang, street gang, or “disruptive group”;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Any parolee placed on “high control” supervision; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Any parolee with a history of being unavailable for supervision, absconding (going missing), escalating parole violations, or other such factors indicating the parolee is likely to commit another crime; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Any parolee required by the BPH to have a GPS monitoring condition.<sup><a href="#footnote-441" id="footnote-ref-441">[440]</a></sup> Failure to wear the GPS device or to keep it charged is a violation of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-442" id="footnote-ref-442">[441]</a></sup> Parolees can be required to pay for the cost of the GPS if they are able to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-443" id="footnote-ref-443">[442]</a></sup></ol>
