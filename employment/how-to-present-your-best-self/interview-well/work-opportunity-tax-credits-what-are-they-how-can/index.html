    Work Opportunity Tax Credits: What are they & how can they encourage employers to hire me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Suggest that your employer look into the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal tax credit historically available to employers for hiring job applicants who face significant barriers to employment, including people with felony convictions who are hired within 1 year after their conviction or release from prison, veterans, and recipients of certain public benefits.[1742] (For this reason, be sure to answer truthfully if an employer or job application asks whether you receive public benefits!) The WOTC ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, depending on your hours and pay during your first year as an employee, and on the maximum allowed credit.[1743] For more information about the WOTC in California, contact the WOTC Coordinator at (916) 227-5163, or visit the Employment Development Department’s (EDD) website about the WOTC at: http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Although the legal authority for the WOTC expired on December 31, 2013, tell your employer that he/she should continue to submit WOTC applications to the EDD. In the past, when the WOTC expired, Congress eventually reauthorized the tax credit and applied it retroactively; so it’s recommended that employers continue to submit applications while reauthorization is pending.[1744]
