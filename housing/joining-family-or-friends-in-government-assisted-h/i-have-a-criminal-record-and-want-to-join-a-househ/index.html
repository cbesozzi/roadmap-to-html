  <p>
    I have a criminal record and want to join a household living in federal government-assisted housing. Can I?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends on your conviction and the requirements of the government-assisted housing program.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There is a good chance you will want to join or rejoin a family living in a government-assisted housing unit.[1215] Unfortunately, the laws and policies for adding an individual with a criminal record to an existing household can be complex, and sometimes the interests of other family members who are living in the government-assisted housing unit will conflict with your interests in joining them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are some COMMON QUESTIONS that often come up, which we will address in this section.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can we challenge a denial if the PHA or owner rejects my application to join the household? How do we do that? (PG. 408) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do I have any rights if I am rejoining my household in government-assisted housing? (PG. 438)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What are the rules if I just want to be a guest of someone living in government-assisted housing and I have a record? (PG. 440)
  </p>
