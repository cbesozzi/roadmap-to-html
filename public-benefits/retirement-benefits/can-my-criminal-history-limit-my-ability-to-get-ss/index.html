  <h2><a href="/public-benefits/retirement-benefits/can-my-criminal-history-limit-my-ability-to-get-ss/index.html">Can my criminal history limit my ability to get SSDI?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Can my criminal history limit my ability to get SSDI?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possibly—but this could be just temporary. You can’t get Social Security benefits for any month that you:[1571]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are confined in a correctional facility for a period of 30+ days in a row due to a conviction;[1572]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are confined to an institution by court order because you’ve been found “guilty” but insane, “not guilty” due to insanity or mental illness, or “incompetent to stand trial”;[1573]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have an open arrest warrant because you’re avoiding prosecution or confinement for a felony; or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are found to be violating a condition of probation or parole.[1574] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of how this works: If you were convicted and confined on March 29, 2014 and stayed in jail until May 2, 2014, you weren’t entitled to benefits for the months of March, April, or May since you were being confined for 35 days in a row.[1575] This means you can’t collect back payments for any SSDI benefits you otherwise would have received if you never had a conviction, warrant, violation, and/or period of confinement as described above.[1576] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, you CAN’T apply for any Social Security benefits based on a disability that is related to a felony you committed. For example, if you fell while committing a felony and lost your ability to walk as a result, that disability won’t qualify you for SSDI.[1577] But you could still apply for SSDI based on a disability that has no connection to your felony.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once you qualify for SSDI, you stay enrolled as long as you still have a qualifying disability. Although your benefits get suspended (paused) during incarceration, they won’t get terminated (permanently ended) due to your incarceration.[1578] This means that if your spouse or children have been getting benefits as your dependents based on your SSDI eligibility, they’ll keep getting these benefits while you’re incarcerated, as long as they stay eligible.[1579]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated for 30 or more days, and you were already getting SSDI when you were arrested, then your SSDI was suspended on your 31st day of incarceration.[1580] But you can apply to restart your SSDI benefits once you have documents showing your release date (see PG. 601). If you weren’t on SSDI when you were arrested, and being incarcerated is the only factor disqualifying you now, you can start a new application for SSDI before your release (see PG. 583).[1581]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONSExceptions for People Incarcerated Before April 1, 2000—What happened to your SSDI during incarceration:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were incarcerated between February 1, 1995 and March 31, 2000: You’re not entitled to SSDI benefits for any month in which you were incarcerated following conviction of a crime punishable by more than a one-year statutory sentence, regardless of the actual sentence imposed by the court. If you were incarcerated before February 1, 1995: Your SSDI benefits get suspended after your 31st day of incarceration only if you were convicted of a felony.If you were incarcerated before April 1, 2000: Your SSDI benefits didn’t get suspended if you were confined by court order because you were found to be “not guilty” due to insanity, “guilty” but insane, or “incompetent to stand trial.[1582]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How do I apply for SSDI? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can apply online, by phone, or in person.[1583] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Online: Visit SSA’s website (www.ssa.gov) and start a new application at https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/dib.[1584]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By phone: Call the SSA at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778). A representative will set up an appointment for you to do your application by phone. This toll-free line is open Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. For each time you call, record the date of your call and the name of the person who helps you.[1585]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In person: First, call the SSA to find the office nearest you; or, if you have Internet access, use the office locator at https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp. Then call to make an appointment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TIPS:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Apply as soon as possible when you become disabled. The application review process can take 3-5 months.[1586] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before you start, you may want to look over the Social Security Administration’s disability application checklist (see Appendix G

    Appendix G, PG. 659) to gather the information you need. [1587]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you need help with the application, call the Social Security Administration or visit a local Social Security office. You have a right to assistance from Social Security representatives if you need help due to a disability.[1588] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a right to appoint any individual—such as a friend, family member, attorney, social worker, or other trusted advocate—to act as your representative in the application process. To do so, use the “Appointment of Representative” form (a copy of form in Appendix E

    Appendix E, PG. 643).[1589] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you need benefits right away due to a financial emergency, ask if you can get “expedited” benefits.[1590] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can I apply for SSDI while incarcerated? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes! You can’t receive Social Security benefits while incarcerated[1591]—but if you haven’t applied for SSDI before, and you think you may qualify, you can start the application process as early as several months before your release date. Keep in mind that review of an SSDI application can take 3-5 months.[1592] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some prisons and jails have a prerelease agreement with local Social Security offices to make this process easier.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IF THIS IS YOUR SITUATION:THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DOIf your facility has a pre-release agreementSpeak to correctional staff. They may be available to help you complete and submit your SSDI application before your release. Correctional staff should also notify the Social Security office about your release date. If a prerelease agreement is in place, staff should start working with you several months before your release, and Social Security should then process your application promptly so that your benefits will start shortly after you get out.[1593]If your facility doesn’t offer prerelease assistance—and/or you have trouble working with correctional staffCall Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to have application materials mailed to you and get help with them. Be prepared to give your Social Security number and release date. If Social Security’s automated phone system doesn’t accept your call, you should ask a non-incarcerated family member to call as an Authorized Representative (“AR”) on your behalf (use the form in Appendix E Medi-Cal Form 210a: “Supplement to Statement of Facts for Retroactive Coverage/Restoration”See the next page for a copy of MC Form 210a.  Appendix E, PG. 643 to appoint a family member as an AR). An SSA representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.[1594] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: If you become disabled while incarcerated, you can’t start getting benefits until (1) you’ve been disabled for five full calendar months or (2) one full calendar month has passed after your release date—whichever is later.[1595]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was receiving SSDI when I got arrested. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What to do if you know you will be incarcerated 30 days or more:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As soon as you know that you will be incarcerated for 30 or more days, you should report this fact to Social Security so that your benefits get suspended in a timely way. If you get any Social Security checks for any months during which you’re incarcerated, these will be treated as overpayments and you’ll have to repay them later. The amounts might get deducted from your future Social Security benefits, when you’re later released from incarceration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were convicted and incarcerated for 30 or more days in a row, your SSDI benefits got suspended on the 31st day.[1596] You can’t receive SSDI benefits while incarcerated, but you’ll stay enrolled in the program. This means that if your spouse or children have been getting benefits as your dependents based on your SSDI eligibility, they’ll keep getting these benefits while you’re incarcerated, as long as they stay eligible.[1597] This also means that once you have official documents proving your release from incarceration, you can apply to restart your SSDI benefits (see PG. 601).[1598]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My SSDI stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart it? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BEFORE RELEASE:AFTER RELEASE:Once you know your release date, notify your correctional counselor (or another staff member at your facility) that you want to restart your SSDI benefits. It’s best to start this process at least 3 months before your release date.[1599] If your facility has a prerelease agreement with Social Security:Staff should be available to help you complete and submit the necessary paperwork in a timely way.[1600]If your facility doesn’t offer prerelease assistance—and/or you have trouble working with correctional staff:Call 1-800-772-1213 (TTY: 1-800-325-0778) to notify Social Security that you were getting SSDI before incarceration, and you want your benefits to restart as soon as possible after your release. The toll-free line is open Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Be prepared to provide your Social Security number and release date. If Social Security’s automated phone system doesn’t accept your call, you should ask a non-incarcerated family member to call as an Authorized Representative (“AR”) on your behalf (use the form in Appendix E Medi-Cal Form 210a: “Supplement to Statement of Facts for Retroactive Coverage/Restoration”See the next page for a copy of MC Form 210a.  Appendix E, PG. 643 to appoint a family member as an AR).A representative will set a post-release appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to provide official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.[1601] You can also ask a friend, family member, or trusted advocate to communicate with Social Security about your benefits on your behalf. You have a right to appoint any individual—such as a friend, family member, attorney, or social worker—to act as your representative in the application process. To do so, use the form located in Appendix F, PG. 653.[1602] If you weren’t able to do so while incarcerated, call Social Security to report that you were released from prison and want to restart your SSDI benefits. A representative will set an appointment for you at a local Social Security office, ask you to bring your official release documents, and tell you what else you need to do.[1603]If your SSDI has only been suspended (paused)—which is what normally happens—it may take only a month to restart it. If you are incarcerated for 12 months or more, then your SSDI benefits would have been terminated, and you have to file a new application to reestablish your eligibility.[1604]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I believe my SSDI was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Many people who apply for SSDI are denied at first, but then get benefits once they appeal. Considering the small odds of getting approved on the first try, be prepared to get denied and to go through the appeals process.[1605]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If Social Security decides to deny your SSDI application, it must mail you a notice of this decision. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a right to appeal. To do so, you must file a “Request for Reconsideration” within 60 days after the date you received the notice.[1606] You can send it by mail, but it’s best to file it in person at a local Social Security office. This way you get a copy with a time-and-date stamp, which proves that you appealed on time.[1607]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can also appeal online at: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/iAppeals/ap001.jsp
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you miss the 60-day deadline due to factors beyond your control, like illness or hospitalization, file a request for a “good cause exception” to the deadline along with your “Request for Reconsideration.[1608]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If Social Security then decides to deny your Request for Reconsideration, it must mail you a notice of this decision.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Again, you have a right to appeal. To do so, you must file a “Request for an Administrative Law Judge Hearing” within 60 days after the date you got the notice.[1609]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you can’t afford a lawyer to help with your appeal, you may be able to find free help by contacting a local legal aid office, a local bar association referral services, or another local nonprofit organization that helps with Social Security issues.[1610]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Helpful HintsSSDI Back-payments
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can’t get back-payments of SSDI for the months you spent in prison or jail. In other words, you can never collect SSDI checks you otherwise would have gotten if you weren’t incarcerated. However, you should be able to collect back-payments of SSDI dating back to the month following the month of your release.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Getting SSDI on the Day You Apply
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In SPECIAL EMERGENCY CASES, you may be able to get benefits on the day you walk into the local Social Security office to complete your SSDI paperwork. This may be possible if:(1) your SSDI was only suspended and not terminated during your incarceration, or you’ve already filed a new SSDI application before your release; (2) you can show proof of a financial emergency; and(3) you haven’t already received benefits for the month.
