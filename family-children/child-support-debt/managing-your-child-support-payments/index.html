            <p class="text">It depends on the <em>date</em> when your most recent child support order was <em>issued</em> by the judge AND for <em>how long</em> you were incarcerated. For most people, though, the answer is NO—child support generally does NOT stop automatically while you’re incarcerated.</p>

You will continue to owe child support payments while you are incarcerated, unless you get the judge to change your child support order. To stop your child support payments while you are incarcerated, you will need to ask the judge to reduce your payments to $0 because you do not have any income (unless you have an outside source of income to make your payments). See PG. 964 to learn how to do this.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><p class="textbox">YES, your payments SHOULD stop automatically if your child support order was issued <em>on or after July 1, 2011, </em>AND you arcerated for <em>90 days or </em>more.</p></td><td><ul class="textbox">If your <em>current</em> child support order was issued <em>on or</em> <em>after July 1, 2011</em> AND you are incarcerated for <em>90 days</em> or more, your child support payments will be <em>automatically paused</em> (suspended) while you are incarcerated.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2491" id="footnote-ref-2491">[2459]</a></sup></sup>This means that you will not owe any child support during the time you are incarcerated, and you will not have to do anything to make this to happen. But your child support payments will <em>automatically continue</em> again after you are released.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2492" id="footnote-ref-2492">[2460]</a></sup></sup>This special law applies to child support orders issued (i.e., made and/or changed) <em>on or after July 1, 2011</em>, for parents who are incarcerated for <em>90 days</em> or more.<sup><a href="#footnote-2493" id="footnote-ref-2493">[2461]</a></sup> However, it may <em>not</em> apply if you are incarcerated for domestic violence, harassment, or for violating a previous child support order, OR if you have outside income and can afford to make payments while you’re incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2494" id="footnote-ref-2494">[2462]</a></sup></ul></td></tr></table>

            <p class="text">You can make payments by one of the following methods, depending on whether or not the Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) is involved:</p>
            <ol class="text">If the LCSA is involved (there is a formal arrangement for support payments between you and the other parent or caregiver:</ol>
            <ol class="text">When you pay your child support, you are making these payments to the California State Disbursement Unit (SDU).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2497" id="footnote-ref-2497">[2465]</a></sup></sup> Under federal law, the California SDU is required to process 100% of child support payments (which used to be processed by the LCSA itself, but no longer).<sup><a href="#footnote-2498" id="footnote-ref-2498">[2466]</a></sup></ol>

            <ol class="text">To find an LCSA office that accepts payments, call 1-866-901-3212 or visit <a href="http://www.childsup.ca.gov/Home/LCSAOffices.aspx">www.childsup.ca.gov/offices</a>.</ol>

(Note: MoneyGram will charge an additional fee for making your payment.)</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>Note:</em> You may need your child support <em>Participant ID</em> number and/or your social security number when you make a payment.</ol>
            <ol class="text">If the LCSA is not involved in your case, you must make payments directly to the other parent (or caregiver)—unless you are told otherwise.</ol>
            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintKeep Records of Your Payments!</h4>
            <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! Whether you are making your payments to the California SDU or directly to the other parent, it’s a good idea to <em>always keep a record of every payment you make</em>. You can keep a separate notebook where you write down the <em>date</em> and <em>amount</em> of each payment, or make notes on a calendar every time you make a payment (including the date and amount).</p>
            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint	I lost my job or went to jail and cannot afford my child support payments!	</h4>
            <p class="textbox">IMPORTANT! If you cannot pay or are falling behind on your child support payments because you lost your job, went to jail, or some other important changes have happened, it’s recommended that you<em> immediately</em> contact the LCSA and/or family court and ask to change your child support amount. Don’t wait! You are responsible for paying the full amount of child support until the LSCA or judge changes the child support order. For more information about changing your child support order, see Appendix K, PG. 1014.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>If you are employed</em>, a portion of your wages will be automatically taken out to pay your current and/or overdue child support (called a <em>wage assignment</em> or <em>wage garnishment</em>).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2500" id="footnote-ref-2500">[2468]</a></sup></sup> This will happen even if you only owe <em>current</em> child support payments, without any overdue payments or interest. If your child support payments are being taken directly from your wages, you should not need to make other payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2501" id="footnote-ref-2501">[2469]</a></sup></sup></p>

            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your CURRENT and FUTURE child support payments is different than the process for changing your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt. This question will explain how to change your <em>current</em> child support payments. To learn about changing your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt, see PG. 960.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p class="text">First the bad news: In general, you CANNOT go back and change the amount of past, overdue child support payments and interest that you owe. (The only exception is for child support orders issued on or after July 1, 2011, or if you agree to settle your past debts owed the other parent or the state—see PG. 960 to learn more).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2502" id="footnote-ref-2502">[2470]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text">But you CAN ask the judge to change the amount of child support that you have to pay in the future, starting from the date when you file your court papers. You CAN also ask the judge to set up a monthly payment plan so you can repay what you owe in installments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2503" id="footnote-ref-2503">[2471]</a></sup></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">To ask for a change in your child support payments while incarcerated, fill out the “Incarcerated Parent’s Request to Review Child Support” form and send it to your local child support agency (LCSA).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2504" id="footnote-ref-2504">[2472]</a></sup></sup> You can ask the prison or jail for a copy of this form, or for a sample form. If the form is not available, you should contact the LCSA immediately by phone or letter, and explain that you are incarcerated and need to change your child support payments.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2505" id="footnote-ref-2505">[2473]</a></sup></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">See Appendix A, PG. 981, to find contact information for a list of LCSAs by county in California.</p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In general, the judge can only change the amount of child support you owe for <em>future</em> payments (starting from the day you file papers asking for the change). The judge cannot reduce the amount of <em>past</em> child support that you owe. Therefore, you should contact the LCSA and/or file your court papers <em>as soon as you are incarcerated</em>, if possible, to request a change in your payments.</p>
            <p class="text"><em>If you are served with new child support papers while in prison or jail</em>, you should contact the LCSA listed on the paperwork right away. It is best to contact the LCSA <em>in writing</em>, by filling out and sending back the blank <em>Response</em> form that you receive with the court papers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2506" id="footnote-ref-2506">[2474]</a></sup> You only have <em>30 days</em> (starting from the day you receive the papers) to respond to the LCSA and/or the court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2507" id="footnote-ref-2507">[2475]</a></sup></sup> You must notify the LCSA again once you are released.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2508" id="footnote-ref-2508">[2476]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text">To change the amount of your current and future child support payments, you must ask the judge or LCSA (if involved in your case) to change your child support order.</p>

How can I change these arrears?</h3>
            <p class="normal1"><strong>It depends on the <em>date</em> when your most recent child support order was issued by the judge AND for <em>how long</em> you were incarcerated.POSSIBILITY #1: <em>If your current child support order was issued on or after July 1, 2011 AND you were incarcerated for 90 days or more</em>:</strong></p>
            <p class="text">Your payments <em>should have</em> automatically stopped while you are incarcerated (see Appendix K, PG. 1014, for more information about automatically stopping your child support payments while incarcerated). After you are released, if you discover that your child support payments were <em>not</em> automatically stopped—i.e., if you find that you owe child support from while you were incarcerated—you can ask the judge to “adjust” your child support arrears (i.e., reduce your debt to $0) for the time you were incarcerated. </p>
            <p class="text">To do this, fill out the Request for Judicial Determination of Support Arrearages or Adjustment of Arrearages Due to Incarceration or Involuntary Institutionalization (Form FL-676, available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl676.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl676.pdf</a> or in Appendix K, PG. 1014), and file it with the family court where your child support order is from. You will need to prove: (1) the dates when you were incarcerated, and (2) that you could not afford to pay child support while you were incarcerated (i.e., that you had no income or other money during that time.) However, if you were incarcerated for a domestic violence or harassment offense, or for violating a previous child support order, OR if you had outside income or assets and could afford to make child support payments while you were incarcerated, the judge may refuse to reduce your debt.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2514" id="footnote-ref-2514">[2482]</a></sup></sup> BUT remember—this ONLY applies if your child support order was on or after July 1, 2011 AND you are incarcerated for 90 days or more.</p>

Unfortunately, the judge <em>cannot</em> go back and change your overdue payments in this case, but you <em>can</em> ask the LCSA or other parent to forgive some of your overdue payments (see next question), and you <em>can</em> ask the judge to change your current child support payments going forward. </p>

            <p class="text">It depends, but probably not entirely.</p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt (“arrears”) is <em>different</em> than the process for changing your CURRENT child support payment amount. This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt. To learn about changing your <em>current</em> child support payments, see PG. 964.</p>
            <p class="text">This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue </em>child support debt.</p>
            <h4 class="step">First, figure out whether you owe overdue child support payments to the other parent (or caregiver) or to the state.</h4>
            <p class="text">To find out, you can contact the LCSA and ask for a breakdown (detailed list) of your arrears. This will show how much you owe to the other parent and/or to the state. The chart below can also help you figure out whom you owe child support to—but it’s always best to get a breakdown from the LCSA to be sure!</p>
            <h4 class="step">Once you know whom you owe money to, use the following chart to figure out your next steps:</h4>

            <h3><a id="_Toc312427170"></a><a id="_Toc314389793"></a><a id="_Toc317247593"></a><a id="_Toc448153692"></a>I receive public benefits. Can a portion of my public benefits be taken to pay for child support?</h3>
            <p class="text">Yes. If you owe <em>any</em> child support payments (current and/or past, overdue payments), a portion of your public benefits payments can be automatically taken out to pay off your child support obligations. Your child support payments can be taken out of <em>any</em> benefits you receive <em>except</em> for General Assistance/General Relief (GA/GR) and SSI.<sup><a href="#footnote-2520" id="footnote-ref-2520">[2488]</a></sup> That means your payments can be taken out of your unemployment, disability, workers compensation, veteran’s benefits, or any other benefits you earn.</p>
            <p class="text">However, if you are already receiving public assistance, the judge <em>may </em>decide that your income is <em>too low</em> to owe <em>current</em> child support payments.<sup><a href="#footnote-2521" id="footnote-ref-2521">[2489]</a></sup> BUT—this <em>only</em> applies to <em>current</em> payments. Even if the judge decides that your income is too low for <em>current</em> payments, you will still owe any <em>past, overdue</em> child support payments that were due in the past. You should ask the judge for a payment plan that lets you to make small payments over time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2522" id="footnote-ref-2522">[2490]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">(Remember: The only way you can avoid paying past, overdue child support payments is (1) if your child support order was issued on or after July 1, 2011, and the payments were due while you were incarcerated for 90 days or more; OR (2) if you get a settlement agreement with the COAP program or other parent.</p>
            <p class="text"><em>For more information on paying child support</em>, you can talk to the court Family Law Facilitator, contact the LCSA, or visit the California Courts’ website on <em>Paying a Child Support Order</em> at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/1197.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/1197.htm</a>.</p>
