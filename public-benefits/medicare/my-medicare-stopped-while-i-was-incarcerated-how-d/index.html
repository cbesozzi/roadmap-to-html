          <h1>My Medicare stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart it?</h1>
          <h3><a id="PB_RestartMedicareAfterRelease"></a><a id="PB_HealthCare_MedicareRestartAfterReleas"></a><a id="_Toc448153327"></a>My Medicare stopped while I was incarcerated. How do I restart it?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you had Part A (hospital insurance) before you were incarcerated, you don’t have to do anything to restart it. Your enrollment should still be in place, and you should have access to Part A coverage as soon as you’re released.<sup><a href="#footnote-1529" id="footnote-ref-1529">[1499]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">If you had Part B (medical insurance) before you were incarcerated, your next steps depend on your situation:</p>
          <ol class="text">If you kept paying premiums and stayed enrolled in Part B while incarcerated: you don’t have to do anything to restart it. Your enrollment is in place, and you should have access to Part B coverage once you’re released.<sup><a href="#footnote-1530" id="footnote-ref-1530">[1500]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If you stopped paying premiums and your Medicare enrollment was ended while incarcerated: you can re-enroll during General Enrollment Period (“GEP”), which runs January to March.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your Part B coverage will start on July 1 of that year. </ol>
          <ol class="text">You’ll have a higher premium based on how many months passed since your Medicare enrollment ended.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you’re under 65 and previously qualified for Medicare due to a disability, you must restart your SSDI before you can get Part B again. Once you know your release date, contact Social Security to do this (see PG. 559).<sup><a href="#footnote-1531" id="footnote-ref-1531">[1501]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If you had Part C (Medicare Advantage) and Part D (prescription drug plan) before you were incarcerated, these forms of coverage ended during your incarceration. If you want Part C and/or D after release, you must enroll again during your Special Enrollment Period (“SEP”). Your SEP starts the month before your release date and ends two months after that date. If you miss your SEP, you’ll be charged a penalty when you try to enroll later.<sup><a href="#footnote-1532" id="footnote-ref-1532">[1502]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you qualified for Medicare through SSDI, you need to restart your SSDI benefits before you can get Medicare coverage back. Even if you contact Social Security before your release, you won’t start getting SSDI again until a month after release. One possible way to avoid a gap in health care coverage is to apply for SSI before your release, if you qualify. If your SSI application is approved, you’ll be automatically enrolled in both SSI and Medi-Cal as soon as you’re released. You’ll only be on SSI for 1 month until your SSDI kicks in, and then your Medi-Cal will be linked to your SSDI again.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1533" id="footnote-ref-1533">[1503]</a></sup></strong> </p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153328"></a>I believe my Medicare was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? </h3>
          <p class="text">The steps you take will depend on what Medicare coverage you have, what decision you want to challenge, and what your situation is. </p>
          <p class="text">What can you do? Call 1-800-MEDICARE to learn what to do in your situation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1534" id="footnote-ref-1534">[1504]</a></sup></sup> If you need help filing an appeal, contact the California Department of Aging's Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program (HICAP) at <br/>1-800-434-0222.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1535" id="footnote-ref-1535">[1505]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">You can also appoint a representative to act on your behalf; this can be a family member, friend, advocate, attorney, doctor, or anyone else you choose. You can appoint a representative in 2 ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-1536" id="footnote-ref-1536">[1506]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">Fill out and submit an “Appointment of Representative” form (see PG. 643).<sup><a href="#footnote-1537" id="footnote-ref-1537">[1507]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Along with your appeal, submit a written request that includes:</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your name, address, phone number, and Medicare number;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your representative’s name, address, phone number, professional status, and relationship to you;</ol>
          <ol class="text">A statement that clearly (1) appoints your representative, (2) authorizes release of your personal and health information to your representative, and (3) explains why you’re being represented; and</ol>
          <ol class="text">Your signature and the date you signed; your representative’s signature and the date they signed.<sup><a href="#footnote-1538" id="footnote-ref-1538">[1508]</a></sup> </ol>
          <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf you are eligible for both, Medicare and Medi-Cal (“Dual Eligibility”)</h4>
          <p class="textbox">Those Eligible for Both Medicare and Medi-Cal: People who qualify for both Medicare and Medi-Cal are known as “dual eligibles” or “Medi-Medis.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1539" id="footnote-ref-1539">[1509]</a></sup> People typically become “dual eligible” by first being enrolled in one program and later becoming eligible for the other program. For example, someone may already meet Medi-Cal’s income requirements, and then age into Medicare when he or she turns 65. Dual eligibles do not necessarily receive the same benefits from Medicare and Medi-Cal.<sup><a href="#footnote-1540" id="footnote-ref-1540">[1510]</a></sup> The majority of dual eligibles receive full Medi-Cal benefits and assistance with Medicare premiums and cost-sharing.<sup><a href="#footnote-1541" id="footnote-ref-1541">[1511]</a></sup> For counseling on dual eligibility, go to Health Consumer Alliance’s (HCA) website and view their list of local HCA call centers at <a href="http://healthconsumer.org/index.php?id=partners">http://healthconsumer.org/index.php?id=partners</a>, or visit Cal MediConnect’s website at <a href="http://www.calduals.org">www.calduals.org</a>. </p>
