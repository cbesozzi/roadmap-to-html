  Graduate academic and professional degree programs
</p>

<p>
  These degrees are offered at four-year colleges and universities and at graduate academic and professional schools. You must have a Bachelor’s degree before you can move on to pursue a graduate academic or professional degree. Students studying to earn one of these degrees must take highly advanced and specialized courses in a specific academic or professional field. It generally takes two years of full-time study for a master’s degree, and three to four years of full-time study for a doctorate degree.
</p>

<p>
  Graduate academic degree programs require advanced study in an academic field. They emphasize theory, as opposed to practical application, with the goal of contributing to the body of knowledge on a subject. Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) are examples of graduate academic degrees. 
</p>

<p>
  Graduate professional degree programs require advanced study in a professional or vocational field. They emphasize the practical application of knowledge to a professional practice, and are usually required in order to get a license to work in that profession.[2803] Master of Engineering (M.E.) and Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) are examples of graduate professional degrees.
