  <p>
    What are some negative factors that could hurt the chances of my request to move/ transfer from being approved?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No job offer in new area;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No or weak family and community ties in the new area;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The new address where you want to move is unsafe;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.
