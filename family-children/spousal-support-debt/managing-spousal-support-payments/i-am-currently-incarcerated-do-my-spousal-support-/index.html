          <p class="text">Your spousal support payments do not automatically stop while you are incarcerated, but you can request that your order be paused or reduced if you are not longer able to pay. For steps on how to change an order, see Appendix L, PG. 1021. </p>
          <p class="text">If you do not ask the family court judge to reduce your spousal support order, then your missed payments plus interest will add up while you are incarcerated, and you must pay this after you are released. </p>
          <p class="text">To reduce or pause spousal/partner support payments, you should either (1) if no children are involved, contact your local Family Law/Self-Help Facilitator OR (2) if children are involved, contact your local child support agency (LCSA). For help to find either your family law/self-help facilitator or LSCA, see Appendix A, PG. 981. </p>

          <p class="text">Because your spousal support payments do not automatically stop while you are incarcerated, then your release will not cause the payments to automatically begin. Follow the court order for your spousal support payments for all relevant dates and amounts owed. </p>
