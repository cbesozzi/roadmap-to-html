  College & university academic degrees
</p>

<p>
  If you have the desire, time, and financial resources to explore a wider range of academic subjects and skills, you may want to pursue a college degree. In college you can study a diverse range of topics, instead of focusing only on the skills you need for one type of job; and you can develop a broad foundation of writing and critical thinking skills to sharpen your mind and prepare you for a wide variety of careers.[2754] A college degree also may help you qualify for more secure, higher-status, and better-paying jobs.[2755] 
</p>

<p>
  If you’re currently incarcerated
</p>

<p>
  You likely do not have access to in-person college programs, but you may be able to pursue a college degree through Distance Education. (See PG. 1076 for information on Distance Education programs.) 
</p>

<p>
  If you’re formerly incarcerated
</p>

<p>
  You can pursue a college degree at a community or junior college, a technical school, or 4-year college or university. While college can be expensive,[2756] there are ways to reduce and supplement the expense (see Paying for College, PG. 1082).[2757]
