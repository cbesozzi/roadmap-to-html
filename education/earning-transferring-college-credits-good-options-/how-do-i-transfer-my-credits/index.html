    How do I transfer my credits?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once you make sure that your credits will transfer to the school you want to attend, the transfer process is simple. When you are applying to your new school, you will need to request your official transcripts from any college or program that you attended in the past, and have them sent to your new school.[2791] You must request your official transcripts—the official record of your grades from the school’s administration records. To find out how to request your official transcripts, contact the admissions and records office of the school you attended. 
  </p>

    NOTE: If you earned college credit while incarcerated, you will need to contact the school that provided the course or program to request a copy of your official transcripts. You do not get them from the facility where you were incarcerated.[2792]
