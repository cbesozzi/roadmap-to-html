  <p>
    Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor’s approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.[851]
