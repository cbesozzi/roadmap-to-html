        <h3><a id="_Toc448153196"></a>What are my legal rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing illegally accesses or uses my criminal record information?</h3>
        <p class="text"><em>THE GENERAL RULE: </em></p>
        <p class="text">In general, if you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG.¬†417) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to PG.¬†408 of this Chapter to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.</p>
        <p><strong><em>SPECIAL RULE for Public Housing &amp; ‚ÄúSection 8‚Äù Housing Choice Voucher programs:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you applied through a PHA for Public Housing or ‚ÄúSection 8‚Äù Housing Choice Vouchers, there is a special rule that says PHAs and owners of the government-assisted housing cannot take any ‚Äúnegligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with‚Äù the laws and regulations governing access to your criminal records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1241" id="footnote-ref-1241">[1211]</a></sup></sup> A negligent action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing knew or should have known that their access to your records violated the law. A knowing action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing <em>actually knew</em> that its access to your records violated the law. </p>
        <p class="text">A PHA or owner MAY BE LIABLE for negligence if they do any of the following:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1242" id="footnote-ref-1242">[1212]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <ol class="text">Improperly disclose a criminal record;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Improperly use a consent form (a.k.a. a ‚Äúrelease‚Äù form); </ol>
        <ol class="text">Fail to <em>notify you</em> of the criminal history information collected; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Fail to <em>provide you</em> with a copy of the information collected (whether you are an applicant or a current tenant); <em>and/or</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">Fail to <em>allow you the right to dispute</em> the information. </ol>
        <p class="text">In this situation, it‚Äôs best to talk to a lawyer! You could recover attorney‚Äôs fees and other litigation costs as part of the relief you get in court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1243" id="footnote-ref-1243">[1213]</a></sup></sup> See the list of legal aid providers on PG.¬†1286 to contact an organization that may be able to provide you legal assistance. </p>
