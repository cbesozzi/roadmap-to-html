          <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153171"></a>Your Rights When a Private Landlord Runs a Criminal Background Check</h3>
          <p class="text">As an applicant to private housing, you have legal rights related to the information that comes up in a private background check, and how a private landlord may use it. The law protects you by making it illegal for certain types of information to be included in a criminal background check (also called a “tenant report,” or in California, a “consumer report”) on you. But there are a lot of laws that limit what a private background check company creating a tenant report for a landlord can share with them.</p>

              <p class="text">STEP 1: The landlord must provide you with a copy of the report and a copy of the <em>Federal Trade Commission Summary of Rights</em> before the negative action is taken—giving you an opportunity to clear up any inaccuracies in the report.</p>
              <p class="text">STEP 2: If the landlord goes forward with the negative action, it must provide you notice about the adverse decision, the contact information of the reporting agency, a statement that the landlord (and not the screening company) made the adverse decision; and your right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of the report.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1210" id="footnote-ref-1210">[1180]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
