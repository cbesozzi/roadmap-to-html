  <p>
    What are my legal rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing illegally accesses or uses my criminal record information?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    THE GENERAL RULE: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In general, if you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG. 417) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to PG. 408 of this Chapter to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SPECIAL RULE for Public Housing & “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher programs:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you applied through a PHA for Public Housing or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers, there is a special rule that says PHAs and owners of the government-assisted housing cannot take any “negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with” the laws and regulations governing access to your criminal records.[1211] A negligent action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing knew or should have known that their access to your records violated the law. A knowing action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing actually knew that its access to your records violated the law. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A PHA or owner MAY BE LIABLE for negligence if they do any of the following:[1212]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Improperly disclose a criminal record;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Improperly use a consent form (a.k.a. a “release” form); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fail to notify you of the criminal history information collected; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fail to provide you with a copy of the information collected (whether you are an applicant or a current tenant); and/or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fail to allow you the right to dispute the information. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this situation, it’s best to talk to a lawyer! You could recover attorney’s fees and other litigation costs as part of the relief you get in court.[1213] See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1286 to contact an organization that may be able to provide you legal assistance.
