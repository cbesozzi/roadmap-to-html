          <h3><a id="_Toc352862208"></a>What is a “wobbler” and why is it important for expungement?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you were convicted of a felony, but were NOT sentenced to a state prison term (or county jail under California’s Realignment Act), your offense is called a “wobbler.” A wobbler is an offense that can be charged as <em>either</em> a misdemeanor or a felony, so the offense “wobbles” between the two offense categories. You can find out if your conviction is a wobbler by reading the California Penal Code section that is listed on your RAP sheet. If it says that the offense is punishable by a fine or time in the county jail (misdemeanor sentences) OR time in state prison or “imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170”<sup><a href="#footnote-3037" id="footnote-ref-3037">[3036]</a></sup> (felony sentence), your offense is considered a wobbler.<sup><a href="#footnote-3038" id="footnote-ref-3038">[3037]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">Remember, felony “wobblers” are eligible for reduction and ultimately expungement if:<sup><a href="#footnote-3039" id="footnote-ref-3039">[3038]</a></sup> </p>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to prison time for the offense; </ol>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT sentenced to county jail instead of prison under Realignment;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT sent to prison for a violation while on probation for the offense;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were NOT convicted of an offense that is NEVER eligible for expungement (see PG. 943); AND</ol>
          <ol class="text">You otherwise meet the requirements for expungement (for more information on these requirements, see PG. 942). </ol>
          <p class="text">For more information on expunging a felony “wobbler” conviction, see PG. 943.</p>
          <p class="text">Although the law does not require you to be off probation, you will have a better chance of getting your conviction reduced if you have successfully completed probation first. For information on how to get off probation early, see PG. 949.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Felonies that CANNOT be reduced to misdemeanors. If you were sentenced to state prison OR sentenced to county jail for a straight felony under Realignment—even if the judge suspended your sentence so you never spent any time in custody—your conviction is NOT eligible to be reduced to a misdemeanor.<sup><a href="#footnote-3040" id="footnote-ref-3040">[3039]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">However, if you <em>never spent any time in prison</em> and you were not sentenced to county jail instead of prison because of Realignment, you may still qualify to have your felony conviction expunged (see PG. 943).<sup><a href="#footnote-3041" id="footnote-ref-3041">[3040]</a></sup></p>
