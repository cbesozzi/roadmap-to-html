          <h3><a id="_Toc448153054"></a>Is it possible that I be released from federal prison and not be on any type of community supervision?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes, it is possible, but rare. If you are NOT paroled and have less than 180 days left on your original sentence when you are released, you will be released <em>without supervision</em>. However, if a “special parole term” is being served, supervision will end at the full term date, and this 180-day date does not apply.</p>
