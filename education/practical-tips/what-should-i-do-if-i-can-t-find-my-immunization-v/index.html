  <p>
    What should I do if I can't find my immunization/vaccination records?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you can’t find your immunization/vaccination records, you may need to get vaccinated again. While this is not ideal, it is safe to repeat vaccines. Your doctor may also be able to do blood tests to see if you are already immune to certain diseases, so you do not have to repeat those vaccinations.[2598]

  <p>
    Setting your educational goals involves asking yourself some important questions about your future. What purpose do you want your education to serve? Is it a way to achieve a specific goal – for example, a way to get a better job? Is it an opportunity for personal growth? Or both?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Going through some of the questions below may make it easier to make a decision and help you get a clear idea of the goals you want to reach. Often there are several answers to a question, so making lists can help you organize your thoughts and priorities.
