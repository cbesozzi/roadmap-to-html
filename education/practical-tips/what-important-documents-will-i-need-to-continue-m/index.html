  <h3><a id="_Toc448153735"></a><a id="ED_educationdocuments"></a>What important documents will I need to continue my education?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">In general, these are the documents you’ll need to have ready as you apply for schools, programs, and financial aid. You may not need all of these, and/or may need others that are not on this list. Check the requirements listed on the school, program, or aid application to be absolutely sure. (NOTE: You can start the process of getting some of these documents while you are still incarcerated): </p>
  
  <ol class="text">High school credential and/or transcripts (see PG. 1054)</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">College credential and/or transcripts (see PG. 1067)</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Immunization/Vaccination Records (see PG. 1033)</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Letters of Recommendation (see PG. 1075); </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">List of References (people who can speak positively of you to schools or programs where you apply)<sup><a href="#footnote-2626" id="footnote-ref-2626">[2594]</a></sup> </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Social Security Number/Card (see BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 41)</ol>

  <ol class="text"><em>For males only:</em> Selective Service registration<sup><a href="#footnote-2627" id="footnote-ref-2627">[2595]</a></sup> (If you were incarcerated during the time when you were supposed to have registered with the Selective Service, you may be able to get a “Status Information Letter” to get around this ban—see BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 90) </ol>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153736"></a><a id="Educ_ImmunizationRecords"></a>What are “immunization/vaccination records” and why do I need them? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">Your immunization record (also called your vaccination record) is a list of all the vaccines (medicines) you received as a child and as an adult that prevent common diseases like polio, chicken pox and tuberculosis. It is required to register for school, for certain jobs, and/or to travel abroad.</p>
