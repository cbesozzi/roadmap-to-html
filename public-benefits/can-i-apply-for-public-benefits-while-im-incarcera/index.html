          <h3><a id="_Toc290125849"></a><a id="_Toc448153259"></a>Can I apply for public benefits while I’m incarcerated?</h3>
          <p class="text">It depends. For some benefits, <em>yes</em>, you can and should! Depending on where you’re incarcerated, there may be special staff or programs in your facility to help you apply for health care, disability support, and other benefits. Often, you can’t start receiving the benefits while you’re still incarcerated—but by signing up before your release, you can ensure you’ll have access to those benefits soon after you get out. This manual will provide information about the programs where this is possible.</p>
