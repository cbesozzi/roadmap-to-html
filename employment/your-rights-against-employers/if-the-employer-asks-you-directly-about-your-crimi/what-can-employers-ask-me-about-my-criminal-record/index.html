        <p class="text">Under state law, employers can ask you questions about certain convictions, but not all.<sup><a href="#footnote-1790" id="footnote-ref-1790">[1760]</a></sup> For example, an employer could ask (on an application or in person): “Have you ever been convicted of a crime?”—but if the employer is following the law, there should be a big warning that says it’s NOT asking you to report convictions you don’t legally have to admit (all those listed, starting on PG. 708).<sup><a href="#footnote-1791" id="footnote-ref-1791">[1761]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">Employers can also ask you direct questions about pending arrests and ongoing/ unresolved cases. For example, and employer could ask (on paper or in-person), “Do you have any pending arrests or unresolved criminal cases?”</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Pending arrests</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">An employer can only ask about arrests and charges that are open or unresolved, NOT about arrests or charges that were dismissed or closed in your favor.</p>
