<h4 class="sidebox">HOW COMMON ARE BACKGROUND CHECKS?</h4>

<p class="sidebox">About 69% of employers run criminal history background checks on all job applicants. About 86% of employers conduct background checks on at least some applicants. Larger companies tend to run routine background on everyone as part of their regular job application process, while smaller companies might not.</p>

In general, PUBLIC employers can only ask about your record AFTER they decide that you meet the basic job qualifications.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST give copy of the background check report or any public records used, and SHOULD give you a chance to correct any errors in your background check report.“Ban the Box” laws give you more rights and protections if you apply for a job with a state or local government agency, and/or in certain local cities and counties.</ul>
