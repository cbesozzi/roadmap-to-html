  <p>
    Can my U.S. probation officer send me back to prison?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No, your probation officer cannot send you back to prison, but it is part of the officer’s job to tell the court about a violation of your conditions. The judge at court, however, usually CAN send you back to prison.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    MINOR VIOLATIONS: Typically, if your probation officer learns of a minor violation of a condition, or believes that a violation is likely to happen, the officer will discuss with you how to avoid a more serious problem. Alternatively, the probation officer might ask the judge to modify your conditions of Federal Probation or Supervised Release. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    SERIOUS or REPEATED VIOLATIONS: After a serious violation or repeated violations, your probation officer may tell a judge about these violations and request revocation of your Federal Probation/Supervised Release. If this happens, you have the right to a revocation hearing, at which the judge may decide to revoke your Federal Probation/Supervised Release and send you back to prison.[859]
