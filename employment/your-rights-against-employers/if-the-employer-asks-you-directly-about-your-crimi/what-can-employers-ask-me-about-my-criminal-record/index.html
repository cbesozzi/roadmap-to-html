  <p>
    What can employers ask me about my criminal record?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under state law, employers can ask you questions about certain convictions, but not all.[1760] For example, an employer could ask (on an application or in person): “Have you ever been convicted of a crime?”—but if the employer is following the law, there should be a big warning that says it’s NOT asking you to report convictions you don’t legally have to admit (all those listed, starting on PG. 708).[1761]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Employers can also ask you direct questions about pending arrests and ongoing/ unresolved cases. For example, and employer could ask (on paper or in-person), “Do you have any pending arrests or unresolved criminal cases?”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Know Your Rights: Pending arrests
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An employer can only ask about arrests and charges that are open or unresolved, NOT about arrests or charges that were dismissed or closed in your favor.
