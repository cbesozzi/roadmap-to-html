    What is a credit report? And what’s the difference between a RAP sheet and a credit report?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In California, a credit report is different from a background check and is covered by a different set of laws.[2881] A credit report contains information about your money and finances—including debts you owe (such as unpaid bills, loans, or leases), your payment history for past bills and debts, and the status of your credit accounts. Your credit report does NOT include your criminal history or other personal information about you. For this reason, this legal guide does not go into detail about the laws governing credit reports.
