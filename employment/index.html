<p><strong>The EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER will help you prepare to reenter the workforce and will guide you throughout the job application process. You will learn about your rights when an employer runs a background check on you, how and when an employer may consider your criminal record, and how to protect your rights in these situations. This Chapter will also help you if you want to apply for a professional or occupational license, start your own small business, or consider other alternatives to traditional employment. Finally, this Chapter will explain your rights in the workplace if your incarceration was the result of a disability, and how to protect yourself against illegal discrimination. </strong></p>
<p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

<p class="text">People with criminal convictions can and do get jobs—it happens every day! They are employed in the workforce at all levels, from entry-level jobs to executive positions. You may (or may not) have to work a little harder to get a job, but it can and will happen. Remember the 3 “P”s—be Persistent, be Professional, and keep a Positive attitude.</p>
<a id="_Toc448153385"></a>
<h1 class="subheading">Preparing to enter the job market</h1>
<h4 class="sidebox">FIND A TRUSTED PERSON</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Find a trusted person and/or other local resources to help you prepare for the job search, navigate any record-related barriers, and find the right job for you! </p>
<p class="text">Before talking about your employment rights, let’s review some basics. This section goes over what you can realistically expect from today’s job market, and the things you need to do and get before you can hold any job.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153386"></a>What can I expect as a job applicant with a criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">The job market is a competitive place for anyone looking for a job. Although it may be a tough process, finding a job is possible if you give it time and effort! It is important to get organized and learn about your options. This section will help you understand the unique rights that you have as a job applicant with a criminal record and how to exercise those rights during your job search. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153387"></a>How will my criminal record affect my job prospects?</h3>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, if you have a criminal record, it is harder to get hired, paid, and promoted fairly. But you are not alone—one in four adults in the U.S. has a criminal record,<sup><a href="#footnote-1721" id="footnote-ref-1721">[1721]</a></sup> and having a record does not mean you are unqualified for the job. If you take steps to understand your rights, responsibilities, and limitations, you can arm yourself with the knowledge necessary to secure the right job.Employers often conduct background checks on job applicants and current employees. In order to be prepared, you must be highly proactive about:</p>
<ol class="text">Learning strategies for how to present your skills, credentials, and personal background (for more information, see PG. 604); Understanding and cleaning up your criminal record (some record-cleaning can only happen later-on in reentry—for more information, see PG. 613); andKnowing and protecting your rights (for more information, see PG. 664).</ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153388"></a>What documents do I need before I apply for any job?</h3>
<p class="text">You should get: (1) official ID and (2) copies of your criminal records to review.</p>
<div class="textstrongemphasis">OFFICIAL FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION:</div>
<p class="text">Before you apply for any job, you should begin the process of applying for basic government-issued IDs. (<em>To learn more about different forms of official ID, see the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21.) </em>In most cases, you will need at least:</p>
<ol class="text">A government-issued ID (such as a Driver License/ State ID, PG. 46, or Passport, PG. 64), ANDEITHER your Social Security Number (SSN) (PG. 40) OR your Birth Certificate (PG. 31).</ol>
<p class="text">You will need these ID documents when you apply for a job and complete the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9, which all employees in the United States must fill out. Form I-9 proves you are legally allowed to work in the country. Your employer should give you this form to fill out. See Appendix A, PG. 673, for more information about Form I-9.Please note that the employer cannot keep your documents, but may make a photocopy of them for your employment file.<sup><a href="#footnote-1722" id="footnote-ref-1722">[1722]</a></sup></p>
<div class="textstrongemphasis">COPIES OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS:</div>
<p class="text">You should get copies of your criminal records so that you know what employers are likely to find out if/when they run a background check. This will help you prepare to answer questions about your history and to address any concerns an employer may have. It’s also good to get a copy of your <em>official</em> criminal record (called a “RAP Sheet”) just for you, to make sure that all the information is accurate, and to correct errors if you find them. See UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029, for information about how to get a copy of your RAP sheet. See PG. 613, below, to learn more about background checks and what information your employer can see.<sup><a href="#footnote-1723" id="footnote-ref-1723">[1723]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153389"></a>How can I prepare for employers’ questions about my criminal record?</h3>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Know everything about your official criminal record.</h5>
<p class="text">Knowing absolutely everything about your criminal record means that you know not only what is in your record, but also what is NOT in your record. You should be aware of all arrests, convictions, dismissals, and sentences that are currently part of your record, but you should also know about any information that has been dismissed, expunged, sealed, removed, or corrected. When you know what your record should look like, you will have a better understanding of how it will affect your job search, and you can make informed decisions about what steps you should take to improve your chances of getting hired.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1724" id="footnote-ref-1724">[1724]</a></sup></sup> </p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Know what employers might find out about you.</h5>
<h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR YOU &amp; YOUR RECORD</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Some of the information you will find on yourself will be things that employers CANNOT SEE, ASK ABOUT, or CONSIDER when you apply for a job. But it is good to know what information is out there, just to be aware of what employers might find and to know how to respond if illegal information shows up in a background check. For complete details on what criminal record information an employer can and cannot see, ask about, or consider, see PG. 615. For a brief summary of this information, read the Know Your Rights Box on PG. 603! </p>
<p class="text">To know what information an employer might find out about you, you will need to do research on yourself. Doing research on yourself is how you will see what information exists out there about you—not just what is in your official criminal record, but also anything public, especially on the Internet (for example, on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram). If you know what employers are going to see, you can be prepared to answer their questions about your history and address any of their concerns. You can also correct any mistakes, and ensure that agencies aren’t illegally providing information that they shouldn’t be reporting.Here are some suggestions for how to conduct research on yourself:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Look online –</em> The best place to start is online. (If you don’t feel comfortable using a computer or the Internet, ask a trusted person—like a case manager, counselor, or friend—to help you.) Search for your name on <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> to see what shows up. If there is negative or untrue information, you (or a trusted person) can send an email to the person who posted the information or the website owner and politely ask them to remove it. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that they will do so, and it could require a lawsuit to get the information down. If the person running the website won’t remove the information, you may want to get the advice of a lawyer (see list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180).<em>Call your references</em> – When you apply for a job, the new employer and/or background check company may contact your past employer(s), people you list as references, and/or other people who know you (like a landlord, neighbor, or teacher) to find out about your work history or other information. An important way to research yourself is to call some of these people (or have a trusted person call for you) to find out what they will say about you. This way you know beforehand if someone is likely to say something negative about you, and you can be sure NOT to list them as a reference on the job application. For more information on listing references, see PG. 607. <em>Get copies of your criminal records</em> – To learn how to get copies of your official and unofficial criminal records, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</ol>
<h5 class="numberboldblack"> <a id="EM_WhatEmployersCanConsiderInCrimRecord"></a>Know what employers CAN &amp; CAN’T consider about your criminal record.</h5>
<p class="text">Knowing your employment rights means knowing what employers can and can’t do when it comes to reviewing and using your criminal history when deciding whether to hire you. It also means knowing how to prevent employers from violating your rights by not hiring you, and what actions you can take if your rights are violated. See PG. 637 to learn more about these rights and how to protect them. In the meantime, the here is a summary of what employers CAN and CAN’T consider about your criminal record.<sup><a href="#footnote-1725" id="footnote-ref-1725">[1725]</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Present yourself in the best way possible.</h5>
<p class="text">Presenting yourself in the best way possible means doing what you can to reduce any negative impressions that your criminal record may cause. This might include addressing your past during job interviews and talking about your rehabilitation efforts and all the changes you have gone through; obtaining proof of rehabilitation, where possible (see Appendix C, PG. 679); making thoughtful decisions about what jobs you apply for (see PG. 605); and cleaning up your record, where it is possible (see PG. 605).<sup><a href="#footnote-1726" id="footnote-ref-1726">[1726]</a></sup> </p>
<h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_KYR_EmployersAndCriminalRecord"></a>Let’s Review:<br/>KNOW YOUR RIGHTSA Summary of What Employers CAN &amp; CAN’T Find Out About Your Criminal Record</h4>
<p class="headingbold11">Employers CAN:</p>
<ul class="textbox">Run a background check on you and CAN consider certain criminal history information when deciding whether to hire you.See and ask about: convictions and unresolved (pending) arrests, charges, or cases. But if the employer uses a private company to run a background check, it CANNOT report convictions older than 7 years.See public records, which generally includes adult court records; police, correctional facility, and CDCR records (including mug shots); and DMV driving records.</ul>
<p class="headingbold11">Most Employers CANNOT:</p>
<ul class="textbox">See or ask about: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions.In general, employers CANNOT see or ask for: Your RAP sheet (your complete, official criminal record); or your credit report.“Ban the Box” laws give you more rights and protections if you apply for a job with a state or local government agency, or in certain cities and counties.</ul>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="EM_PresentingYourself"></a><a id="_Toc448153390"></a>How to present your best self</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153391"></a>How do I present my best self to an employer?</h3>
<p class="textbox">While you can’t control everything about the job search, there are MANY steps you can and should take to improve your chances of being hired for the job you want—whether that means cleaning up your record, finishing school, or learning new skills and getting more experience. This section will explain what you can do <em>before</em> you begin applying for jobs, <em>throughout</em> your job search, and <em>during </em>your application process, to help improve your chances of being hired.</p>
<ol class="text">BEFORE you begin applying for jobs:Beef up your resume before any new job applicationClean up your recordTHROUGHOUT your job search:Target your job search for jobs that are an appropriate fit for youWHILE APPLYING for jobs:</ol>
<h4 class="sidebox">VOLUNTEERING</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Consider volunteering with local religious or community organizations, and plan to stick around for at least 6 months. The length of time you remain dedicated to the organization is more important than the amount of time you spend volunteering during a particular day or week. Your volunteer work can help to calm an employer’s concerns about your past, and strong references can go a very long way in helping to secure a future paying position.<strong> </strong></p>
<ol class="text">Ace the job applicationInterview wellUnderstand and explain the benefits to the employer</ol>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153392"></a>Beef up your resume</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153393"></a>How can I build up my resume?</h3>
<p class="text"><strong><em>1. Explore volunteer opportunities. </em></strong>Volunteering is a great way to learn new skills, gain solid references, find out about local job opportunities, and show potential employers that you are dedicated and responsible. Although it is usually unpaid, it strengthens your application and offers experiences you can talk about in your job search.<strong><em>2. Go back to school. </em></strong>Going back to school to get your GED or advanced college or professional degree shows that you are responsible, focused and driven—all qualities that employers look for when hiring. As a practical matter, going back to school can offer you training to expand your skillset and qualify you for more jobs. <strong><em>3. Participate in a reentry program. </em></strong>Employers will be impressed if you are proactive and take steps to grow and learn from challenging past situations. Reentry programs in your local area may be able to help you in your job search, and support you in your transition. To find out about reentry programs or other employment opportunities, we recommend that you attend local reentry fairs and/or talk to people (in prison or jail or outside) who might know about these programs. Ask your counselor or case manager, parole or probation officer, mentor or sponsor, or others for recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">TALK TO YOUR TRUSTED PERSON</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Talk to your trusted person or someone at a workforce development program to see what school, work, and volunteer opportunities are available in your area, and for other ideas about how to build your resume and gain new skills.</p>
<p class="text"><strong><em>4. Participate in workforce development (job readiness) programs. </em></strong>Many organizations have workforce development or job readiness programs for people with criminal records or other employment barriers. These programs help you to search for jobs, improve your job skills, and prepare for job applications and interviews. They provide services like job counseling, job training, resume writing, interview coaching, and sometimes job placement and referrals. Even if there are no reentry-focused job readiness programs in your area, look for programs with similar services. Sometimes the only workforce development program near you will be an America’s Job Center, which is run by the government. If the America’s Job Center is your only option, then you should definitely take advantage of the case managers and other programs there. However, if there are other workforce programs available in your area, we recommend that you use those first, since they can provide more individual attention and help. For a list of workforce development programs around the state, see Appendix B, PG. 677, or call 2-1-1 to ask about programs in your area.</p>
<h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_HH_EDD_OneStopCenter"></a>HELPFUL HINTWhat are America’s Job Centers of California?</h4>
<p class="textbox">America’s Job Centers of California (once called One-Stop Career Centers) are job readiness centers run by the state through the California Employment Development Department (EDD), a state agency that assists workers and employers. America’s Job Centers provide FREE services and resources to people looking for work, including: job counseling to figure out what jobs are right for you; free access to phones, fax machines, computers, and Internet; job search and résumé writing workshops; community resources and referrals for training; and job fairs.To find an America’s Job Center near you, go to <a href="http://www.americasjobcenter.ca.gov/">http://www.americasjobcenter.ca.gov/</a>. To find job fairs and workshops, go to <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/Jobs_and_Training/Job_Fairs_and_Events.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/Jobs_and_Training/Job_Fairs_and_Events.htm</a> and follow the links to find events in your region.</p>
<a id="EM_CleanUpYourRecord"></a>
<a id="_Toc448153394"></a>
<h2 class="subheading2">Clean up your record</h2>
<h4 class="sidebox">What about STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Some people find it more fulfilling and empowering to be their own boss. Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, freedom and flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibilities at work. Think about your skills, interests, and previous work experience or vocational training. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, read the section on “Alternatives to Traditional Employment,” starting on PG. 660 for more information and helpful resources on starting your own business.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153395"></a>Can I clean up my record? </h3>
<p class="text">Maybe. Your record is not necessarily permanent for the purpose of getting a job. You may be able to clear—or more likely lessen the impact of (in other words, “clean up”)—your criminal record, making you more attractive to potential employers. For more information about the different ways to clean up your record, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029. Different organizations may offer “clean slate” services in your area, such as:</p>
<ol class="text">Public Defenders Offices“Clean Slate” or “Second Chance Clinic” programsCivil Legal Aid Programs</ol>
<p class="text">For more information about finding “clean slate” services and programs in your area, see the list of legal aid providers on PG 1180. For more information about ways to show employers proof of your rehabilitation, see Appendix C, PG. 679.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="EM_TargetYourJobSearch"></a><a id="_Toc448153396"></a>Target your job search</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153397"></a>How do I target my job search and find the best fit?</h3>
<div class="textstrongemphasis"><em>1. Consider the type of job you’re applying for.</em></div>
<p class="text">Employers will be more concerned if the job position you are applying for requires you to do work that directly relates to your past convictions. For example, if you’ve been convicted of theft, this may concern an employer who is looking to hire someone to become a manager or cashier at a store. If you can proactively point out that the circumstances of your crime—including the seriousness of the offense and the length of time since it occurred—won’t affect your ability to do the job, an employer is more likely to feel you will be an honest and truthful worker. Also, there may be some types of jobs or occupational licenses that you can’t hold by law, based on your conviction offense. See PG. 652 for more information about legal restrictions for certain types of jobs.</p>
<div class="textstrongemphasis"><em>2. Consider the type of employer you’re applying to. </em></div>
<p class="text">Consider the type, size, and management style of the company to which you are applying. Most applications ask whether or not you have been convicted of a crime, but some only ask about felonies. Some experts suggest that applying to a small business could be more successful than a larger corporation, because this allows you the opportunity to speak directly with the owner and explain what happened.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153398"></a>Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">It’s possible. Before applying for work, you should know that a few types of jobs have legal restrictions that disqualify people with certain past convictions from working in that position. Also, certain types of jobs require you to have a professional or occupational license from the state, and such licenses have their own legal restrictions and can be difficult to get depending on what’s in your record. For more information on legal restrictions and professional licenses—and how you can become re-eligible to work in some cases—see “Jobs &amp; Professions Your Record Might Exclude You From,” starting on PG. 652.<em>Examples of jobs with legal restrictions for certain types of convictions:</em></p>
<ol class="text">Airport security screeners;Federal law enforcement officers;Bank employees;Childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies;Port workers.</ol>
<p class="text"><em>Examples of jobs that require a professional or occupational license:</em></p>
<ol class="text">Barber;Beautician / Cosmetologist;Pharmacist;Nurse;Cemetery / funeral home worker;Real estate agent.</ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Most jobs do NOT have legal restrictions. The information here isn’t intended to discourage you, but to help you understand your options and find the job that’s right for you. Also, even if an employer cannot hire you for one type of job based on your record, they may have other types of jobs available that you ARE eligible for and could do instead.</p>

<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTConsider All Your Job Options </h4>
<p class="textbox">As you’re thinking about jobs or looking for work, it can be helpful to think about other work options—alternatives to traditional employment—like starting your own business, joining a worker-run cooperative business, or going through a temp agency. You may decide that one of these alternatives is more exciting, more convenient for your schedule and needs, or just a good way to get your foot in the door with an employer.Here are some other ways of working and earning an income that are different from traditional employment:</p>
<ul class="textbox">Consider self-employment or become an independent contractorStart your own businessJoin a worker-run cooperative businessApply through a temp agencyTake short-term jobs or temporary positions to get your foot in the door.</ul>
<p class="textbox">For more information on each of these options, read section on Alternatives to Traditional Employment, starting on PG. 660 below.</p>
<a id="_Toc448153399"></a>
<h2 class="subheading2">Ace the job application</h2>
<h4 class="sidebox">A NOTE ABOUT BAD REFERENCES</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Under state law, former employers and other references ARE allowed to say negative things about you as part of a job reference.<em>So you should always ask your reference if they are willing to be listed, and you can ask what they will say about you before you list them.</em></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153400"></a>How can i have a successful job application?</h3>
<p class="text">In the past, applying for a job meant filling out a paper application and handing (or mailing) it to the employer. Now, any information that you give about yourself may become part of your job application that the employer considers. This includes information you share with the employer or other employees at the company, with a temp agency, at a job fair, at a workforce development center, or with other people or organizations that are involved in your job search process. It can include paperwork you fill out or sign, a questionnaire that you complete, information that you type in online, documents you hand in, or answers/information that you say in person.</p>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTS</h4>
<ol class="text"><em>Listing Previous Work Experience</em></ol>
<p class="textbox">If an application asks about your previous work experience, MAKE SURE you accurately write the dates of your previous employment and how much you were paid! The new employer will probably contact your former employers to check your references and ask about this information. If you list incorrect information about the dates you were employed or your wages at your past job (even by mistake!), the new employer may think you’re intentionally lying and may reject your application for that reason. If you can’t remember the exact dates you worked or your wages, write down that you are guessing or estimating this information, and that you are NOT certain. This will show the employer that you’re trying to be honest and are not intentionally giving wrong information.</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Listing personal and professional references</em></ol>
<p class="textbox">When you apply for a job, you will probably have to give a list of references—people who know you and can talk about whether you’re a good worker. Most likely this will be an old employer, but it could also be a teacher from a vocational training or certification program, or even someone from your church or other community organization that you’re involved in. The new employer will contact these people to ask about your previous work history, personality, whether you were a good employee, and other information to help decide if they should hire you.Be careful about whom you list as a reference and what they will say about you! BEFORE you list someone as a reference, it is best to call the person (or have a trusted person call for you) to ask what they will say about you. If it turns out they say something negative, you’ll know not to list them after all. Keep in mind that even if you don’t list someone as a reference, an employer or background check company may still contact them as part of their own background check process.</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Ask your trusted person!</em></ol>
<p class="textbox">If you’re filling out a paper or online application, ask your trusted person, or someone from a local reentry or workforce development program, to look over your completed application before you send it to the employer.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153401"></a>Interview well</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153402"></a>How can I succeed in an interview?</h3>
<p class="text">Here is a list of the essential steps to prepare for and succeed in an interview with a potential employer. For more detailed information about each of these steps, please see the Appendix D, PG. 680.</p>
<h4 class="step">Thoughtfully answer each interview question.Ask your own questions.Practice beforehand!</h4>
<p class="text">If possible, you should try to do a practice (“mock”) interview before the real thing with your case manager, social worker, counselor, or even family or friends.

<h3 class="subheading3"><a id="EM_BenefitsToEmployer"></a>Understand &amp; explain the benefits of Hiring People with Records to the Potential employer </h3>
<p class="text">Learn here about two government programs that are meant to encourage employers to hire people with criminal records: (1) the Federal Bonding Program and (2) the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC).</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153403"></a>Bonding Insurance: What is it &amp; how can it encourage employers to hire me?</h3>
<p class="text">Some employers require their employees to be covered under fidelity bonding insurance, which is a special type of insurance that protects the employer from money or property loss caused by employee dishonesty. If your employer requires fidelity bonding insurance, there are two options: (1) private fidelity bonding insurance, and (2) the Federal Bonding Program.<strong><em>(1) Private Bonding Insurance—</em></strong>Many private insurance companies sell fidelity bonding insurance that employers can buy. The insurance will reimburse employers for losses due to things like forgery, theft of money or valuables, or fraud by a company employee. An employer can buy insurance coverage for ALL employees, or for only a few, specific employees.<sup><a href="#footnote-1727" id="footnote-ref-1727">[1727]</a></sup> However, if you already have a criminal conviction record, your employer may not be able to get private bonding insurance for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1728" id="footnote-ref-1728">[1728]</a></sup> In this case, the employer may be able to get bonding insurance through a special federal government program (see immediately below). <strong><em>(2) Federal Bonding Program—</em></strong>If you already have a criminal conviction record, your employer may not be able to get private bonding insurance for you. If you are applying for a job with an employer who requires employees to be covered by fidelity bonding insurance, the federal government has a special program to provide FREE fidelity bonding insurance for 6 months to cover individuals who are eligible for the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1729" id="footnote-ref-1729">[1729]</a></sup> In California, the California Employment Development Department (EDD)—the same state agency that runs America’s Job Centers of California—runs the Federal Bonding Program. For more information and instructions on how to apply for the Federal Bonding Program, see Appendix E, PG. 682.</p>
<h5 class="question">Am I eligible for the Federal Bonding Program?</h5>
<p class="text">If you meet the following requirements, you may be eligible for the Federal Bonding Program:</p>
<ol class="text">You have a firm job offer (or are already employed) at a job that is likely to be long-term or permanent. The job requires you to be bonded, and you cannot get private bonding insurance due to your arrest or conviction record, history of drug or alcohol abuse, poor credit or employment history, dishonorable discharge from the military, or other “risk” factors.The employer is ready to hire you (or keep you on the job) once you have insurance, so the only thing stopping you from working there is the lack of insurance.You are 18 or older and legally eligible to work in the U.S.</ol>
<p class="text">For a complete list of eligibility requirements, see Appendix E, PG. 682. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Your employer can only get free insurance coverage for the first 6 months that you work there; after that they will have to purchase insurance directly. If you switch to another job that also requires bonding, you will have to reapply to the EDD, and they will decide on a case-by-case basis whether you can get new insurance coverage at the new employer. If you left your previous job on good terms, you will have a better chance of getting bonding insurance for your next job, but it is not guaranteed.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1730" id="footnote-ref-1730">[1730]</a></sup></strong> For this reason, it’s recommended that you only use the bonding program for jobs that are likely to be long-term or permanent—NOT for temporary positions.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1731" id="footnote-ref-1731">[1731]</a></sup></strong></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153404"></a>Work Opportunity Tax Credits: What are they &amp; how can they encourage employers to hire me?</h3>
<p class="text">Suggest that your employer look into the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal tax credit historically available to employers for hiring job applicants who face significant barriers to employment, including people with felony convictions who are hired within 1 year after their conviction or release from prison, veterans, and recipients of certain public benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1732" id="footnote-ref-1732">[1732]</a></sup> (For this reason, be sure to answer truthfully if an employer or job application asks whether you receive public benefits!) The WOTC ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, depending on your hours and pay during your first year as an employee, and on the maximum allowed credit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1733" id="footnote-ref-1733">[1733]</a></sup> For more information about the WOTC in California, contact the WOTC Coordinator at (916) 227-5163, or visit the Employment Development Department’s (EDD) website about the WOTC at: <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm</a>. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Although the legal authority for the WOTC expired on December 31, 2013, tell your employer that he/she should continue to submit WOTC applications to the EDD. In the past, when the WOTC expired, Congress eventually reauthorized the tax credit and applied it retroactively; so it’s recommended that employers continue to submit applications while reauthorization is pending.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1734" id="footnote-ref-1734">[1734]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
<a id="EM_KeyTerms"></a>
<a id="_Toc448153405"></a>
<h1 class="subheading">Key terms in the employment chapter</h1>
<h4 class="sidebox">Get a Copy of Your RAP Sheet</h4>
<p class="sidebox">You can request a copy of your RAP sheet from the California Department of Justice (DOJ) by filling out an application, getting fingerprinted, and sending everything to the DOJ. It can take a couple weeks for the DOJ to process your request and send you an official RAP sheet. For more information on getting a copy of your RAP sheet, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029.If you don’t want to wait for your RAP sheet, you can also get a copy of your court records directly from the courthouse where you were convicted. If you go to the court in person, you can often get a copy of your records the very same day. Some courts will also let you request your records online, without having to go in person (although you will have to wait longer for the court to mail you the paper copies). To get your court records, you will need to have (or look up) your case number, and you will probably have to pay a fee for photocopying (usually around 50 cents/page). </p>
<p class="text">Before we discuss the laws that will affect you as you reenter the job market, let’s review a few key terms. (For more detailed definitions and explanations of these terms, see UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029).<strong>Criminal Record:</strong><span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>This is the general term we use for all of the information about your criminal history. Your “criminal record” includes arrests, charges against you, convictions, pleas, acquittals, dismissals, sentences, and any other time your contact with law enforcement was documented.<strong> RAP Sheet:</strong><span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>A RAP sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution) is the government’s official version of your criminal record. It lists every contact you’ve had with the criminal justice system, including arrests, convictions, acquittals, dismissals, and sentences.<sup><a href="#footnote-1735" id="footnote-ref-1735">[1735]</a></sup> If you’ve been arrested or convicted of a crime in California, you could have 3 different RAP sheets:</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">County RAP sheet</span>—all of your criminal justice contact in a single county (so if you have arrests or convictions in more than one county, you will have a separate RAP sheet for each county); <span class="emphasisitalic">California DOJ RAP sheet</span>—all of your contact with the criminal justice system across the state of California;<sup><a href="#footnote-1736" id="footnote-ref-1736">[1736]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">FBI RAP sheet</span>—all of your contact with the criminal justice system from anywhere in the U.S. (so if you have arrests or convictions in more than one state, all of these should show up on your FBI RAP sheet).<sup><a href="#footnote-1737" id="footnote-ref-1737">[1737]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text"><strong>Background Check:</strong> This is the process of looking up information about someone’s past activities—their criminal records, finances and credit, or other personal information—through public records, Internet searches, or interviewing people you know. When you apply for a job, the employer will most likely pay an outside company to run a background check on you. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: You have legal rights when someone runs a background check on you! The law limits what information can be included in your background check and what information employers, landlords, and others can use, and it allows you to challenge mistakes and violations. </p>
<p class="text"><strong>Consumer Report</strong>—This is the technical, legal name of the document that that is produced when an employer (or anyone else) runs a background check on you (produced by private companies called “Consumer Reporting Agencies”—see next definition). Since “consumer report” is the technical term, but not used by most, this Chapter uses the layperson term “background check reports.”<strong>Reporting Agency</strong>—This is a company that investigates and produces background check reports.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1738" id="footnote-ref-1738">[1738]</a></sup></sup> They’re also called Consumer Reporting Agencies (federal law) and Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies (state law), but this Chapter uses the layperson term “background check companies.”</p>

<p class="textbox">This section explains the laws and your rights when an employer runs a background check on you for a job. It will explain what information an employer CAN and CANNOT see, ask about, and consider about your criminal record; and what information background check companies CAN and CANNOT report about you. It also explains how to correct background check errors, and what you can do if an employer or background check company violates the law.</p>

<p class="text">This section will explain your rights when an employer runs a background check on you or asks you about your criminal record, and what you can do if the employer violates your rights. The next section will explain your rights when a background check company produces a report on you, and what you can do if the background check company violates your rights (see PG. 633).</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">HOW COMMON ARE BACKGROUND CHECKS?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">About 69% of employers run criminal history background checks on all job applicants. About 86% of employers conduct background checks on at least some applicants. Larger companies tend to run routine background on everyone as part of their regular job application process, while smaller companies might not.</p>
<h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSYour rights against employers</h4>
<ul class="textbox">Employer CAN run a background check on you and CAN consider certain parts of your criminal history when deciding whether to hire you.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report or any public records used.Employers CAN see and/or ask about: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; court records; police, correctional facility, and CDCR records (including mug shots); DMV driving records; other public records. In general, employers CANNOT see or ask about: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.In general, PRIVATE employers can ask about your record at any time. In general, PUBLIC employers can only ask about your record AFTER they decide that you meet the basic job qualifications.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST give copy of the background check report or any public records used, and SHOULD give you a chance to correct any errors in your background check report.“Ban the Box” laws give you more rights and protections if you apply for a job with a state or local government agency, and/or in certain local cities and counties.</ul>
<h4 class="textbox">Your rights against background check companies</h4>
<ul class="textbox">Background check companies CAN report information about convictions; pending arrests or criminal charges; lawsuits and civil (money) judgments against you; evictions; DMV driving records; and other personal information from within the past 7 years.Background check companies CANNOT report information about convictions; lawsuits; unpaid judgments; tax liens; or any other negative information that is more than 7 years old.Background check companies MUST check that information from public records is accurate and up-to-date.</ul>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153408"></a>How can employers learn about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">There are three main ways an employer can access information about your criminal history:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>The employer can ask you about it.</em> Some employers will ask you directly if you have a criminal record. For this reason, it is important that you know your rights about what can be asked and what you have to answer. See PG. 615 to learn more.<em>The employer can pay a private background check company to run a background check report on you.</em> Background check companies are private companies that create background check reports for employers. This is the most common way for an employer to find out information about your past because it is easy, fast, and usually done online. See PG. 633 to learn more. <em>The employer can conduct an “in house” background check.</em> Some employers will do their own background check and look up your public records, research you online, and call your friends, family members, and former employers to ask about you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1739" id="footnote-ref-1739">[1739]</a></sup> See PG. 627 to learn more.</ol>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153409"></a><a id="EM_WhatEmployerCanAskAboutCrimRecord"></a>If the employer asks you directly about your criminal record</h2>
<h3 class="subheading3">When can an employer ask me directly about my criminal record &amp; what can they ask about?</h3>
<p class="text">An employer might ask about your criminal record in writing, on a job application, or in an interview. This section discusses all of these situations. It’s important to know your rights:</p>
<ol class="text">There are limitations to WHAT an employer can ask about and learn from you by asking, either on an application or in an in-person interview.There are also limitations on WHEN an employer can ask you about certain information—they cannot ask you everything up front! </ol>
<p class="text">These laws are meant to protect you from discrimination as you apply for jobs.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153410"></a>What can’t employers ask about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">There are certain parts of your criminal record that employers CANNOT legally ask you about. Under state law, an employer cannot ask you about:</p>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTPublic vs. Private Employers</h4>
<p class="textbox">Public (government) employers can ask and get access to more information than private companies or nonprofit organizations. Read carefully to understand what laws apply to public vs. private employers.</p>
<ol class="text"><em>Convictions that have been sealed, dismissed, expunged, or statutorily eradicated.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1740" id="footnote-ref-1740">[1740]</a></sup> A private employer cannot ask a question like, “Have you ever been convicted of any crimes that were dismissed?” And if a private employer asks about these convictions, you don’t have to report ones that were expunged/dismissed.EXCEPTION: On the other hand, public (government) employers and law enforcement agencies can request more information about dismissed records from you than private employers.<sup><a href="#footnote-1741" id="footnote-ref-1741">[1741]</a></sup><em>Convictions for minor marijuana-related offenses, if the conviction is over 2 years old.</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1742" id="footnote-ref-1742">[1742]</a></sup></sup> Minor marijuana-related convictions over 2 years old that an employer CANNOT ask about include, but are not limited to:Marijuana possession (other than concentrated cannabis).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1743" id="footnote-ref-1743">[1743]</a></sup></sup>Carrying or giving away small amounts of marijuana (other than concentrated cannabis).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1744" id="footnote-ref-1744">[1744]</a></sup></sup>Having a pipe, bong, or other device for illegally smoking marijuana.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1745" id="footnote-ref-1745">[1745]</a></sup></sup>Being in a room, car, or other location with someone who is illegally using or smoking marijuana, and helping them to do it.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1746" id="footnote-ref-1746">[1746]</a></sup></sup>Unlawfully being under the influence of marijuana (in other words, being <em>high</em>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1747" id="footnote-ref-1747">[1747]</a></sup><em>Arrests that did not lead to a conviction.</em> Employers (private and most public employers) CANNOT ask about past arrests where you were not convicted of the alleged crime. This includes arrests where the charges against you were never brought, charges were dismissed, and cases where you were found not guilty. THERE ARE 3 EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE YOU SHOULD KNOW:<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1748" id="footnote-ref-1748">[1748]</a></sup>First, private and public employers can still ask about recent arrests that are pending or unresolved (for example, if you were arrested, posted bail money, and are awaiting trial, the arrest is still considered pending, and employers can learn out about those). PLEASE NOTE: If you live in a city or county that has “banned the box,” the rule for when employers can ask about pending arrests is different. See PG. 615 for more information about when an employer can ask.Second, law enforcement employers can ask about and consider all arrests.Third, health care facilities and pharmacy employers can ask about and consider CERTAIN arrests (for drug and/or sexual offenses) if you are applying for a job with regular access to drugs or medications (for drug arrests), or to patients (for sexual offense arrests).<em>Arrests that led to the completion of a court diversion program.</em> A court diversion program (such as a drug rehabilitation program) helps a person charged with certain crimes avoid criminal charges—and therefore avoid a criminal record. By law, employers are NOT allowed to ask for any information about your participation in a court diversion program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1749" id="footnote-ref-1749">[1749]</a></sup> </ol>
<h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Convictions More Than 7 Years Old</h4>
<p class="sidebox">There is a weird gap in the law that you should know about. While employers CAN ask about and consider convictions older than 7 years old (and can ask you about these as part of an in-house background check), private background check companies CANNOT report information about convictions more than 7 years old on your background check report. This CANNOT come up in a background check.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="importantbox">REMEMBER: In general, if an employer asks you if you were ever arrested, you SHOULD NOT answer that question, and you DO NOT have to. Politely remind the employer that if he/she wants to learn about your criminal record, he/she can ask ONLY about relevant convictions—NOT arrests—to protect your rights.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153411"></a>What can employers ask me about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Under state law, employers can ask you questions about certain convictions, but not all.<sup><a href="#footnote-1750" id="footnote-ref-1750">[1750]</a></sup> For example, an employer could ask (on an application or in person): “Have you ever been convicted of a crime?”—but if the employer is following the law, there should be a big warning that says it’s NOT asking you to report convictions you don’t legally have to admit (all those listed, starting on PG. 615).<sup><a href="#footnote-1751" id="footnote-ref-1751">[1751]</a></sup>Employers can also ask you direct questions about pending arrests and ongoing/ unresolved cases. For example, and employer could ask (on paper or in-person), “Do you have any pending arrests or unresolved criminal cases?”</p>
<h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Pending arrests</h4>
<p class="sidebox">An employer can only ask about arrests and charges that are open or unresolved, NOT about arrests or charges that were dismissed or closed in your favor.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153412"></a>When can (and can’t) employers ask about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, the answer is complicated because the rules are not the same for all types of employers, and vary between some counties and cities. <em>When</em> a California employer can ask about your criminal record depends on the following factors:</p>
<ol class="text">Whether it’s a public (state or local government) or private employer, ANDFor private employers, what county and city it operates in.</ol>
<p class="text">Because of these differences, this section is divided into rules for <em>public (government) employers</em> and rules for <em>private employers</em>. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153413"></a>When can a public (government) employer in California ask about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Because of the recent state law known as “Ban the Box,” public employers in California CANNOT ask you—in-person, verbally, or in writing on a job application—ANY information about your conviction history until AFTER the employer has determined that you meet the minimum job requirements. This law applies statewide to ALL state and local government employers, but does NOT apply to <em>federal government jobs</em>, <em>jobs with law enforcement, or positions that require a criminal background check by law</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1752" id="footnote-ref-1752">[1752]</a></sup> </p>
<ol class="text"><em>Please Note:</em> The current interpretation of California's "Ban the Box" law is that it does <em>not</em> apply to community colleges in their function as state employers, meaning that they are legally allowed to ask you <em>certain questions </em>about your criminal record in the initial application—but nothing from the list of “never-ask” criminal background questions starting on PG. 615).</ol>
<p class="answer">Some cities and counties in California (such as San Francisco, Richmond, and Compton) have passed their own local “Ban the Box” laws that sometimes apply to certain private employers. Los Angeles County is currently considering passing its own local “Ban the Box” law in 2016, as well. See Appendix F, PG. 684, for more information about local “Ban the Box” laws in California (such as the one in San Francisco called the “Fair Chance Ordinance”).</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153414"></a>When can a private employer in California ask about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on your city and county. For many years, across the entire state, a private employer could ask certain questions about your criminal record at any time, and most private employers can still ask these questions AT ANY TIME. Recently, however, San Francisco passed a “Ban the Box” law that applies to private employers. This means that in SF, employers must wait to ask about records until AFTER they have determined the person would be qualified, just like public employers must around the state. For now, San Francisco is the ONLY county in which “Ban the Box” legislation applies to private employers, but other cities and counties are considering similar legislation. See Appendix G, PG. 686, for a full explanation of the San Francisco law, called the Fair Chance Ordinance.In addition, the cities of Richmond and Compton have implemented “Ban the Box” laws that apply to government contractors—meaning private employers that have contracts with the local city government. If you are applying to a job with a private contractor in one of those cities, you should find out if “Ban the Box” would apply to you. See Appendix H, PG. 690 to learn about Richmond, CA’s “Ban the Box” law. </p>

<h3 class="subheading3">If the employer uses a private background check company, what can it find out and consider? What are the rules that limit these searches?</h3>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153416"></a>Are employers legally allowed to run a background check on me?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes. In California, employers are allowed to conduct background checks “for employment purposes”–when deciding whether to hire, promote, reassign, or keep you on as an employee. Private Background check companies are allowed to provide background checks (also called consumer reports) to anyone the agency reasonably believes will use the information “for employment purposes.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1753" id="footnote-ref-1753">[1753]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf an employer tells me that they will run a background check, should I still apply for the job?</h4>
<p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisheavy">Yes! </span>Even if the employer does run a background check, this doesn’t mean that they won’t hire you. 58% of employers allow job applicants to explain the results of their background check before the employer makes a final decision about whether or not to hire them. See PG. 604 above for some tips on how to discuss your background and record in the most favorable way—showing the employer why he/she should hire you and give you a chance!</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153417"></a>Can an employer consider my credit history?</h3>
<p class="text">Generally, no. Employers CANNOT look at your credit report unless you are applying for certain high level or sensitive job positions, such as a manager or supervisor within a company, a law enforcement officer, or a position with access to large amounts of cash and/or sensitive financial information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1754" id="footnote-ref-1754">[1754]</a></sup> If you have further questions about your credit history, contact a local legal service organization or call 2-1-1. </p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153418"></a>Are employers legally required to conduct criminal background checks?</h3>
<p class="text">Generally, no. Most of the time, the employer is not legally required to run a background check, though many choose to.<sup><a href="#footnote-1755" id="footnote-ref-1755">[1755]</a></sup> The only exception to this rule is if the job involves unsupervised access to sensitive populations or the handling of sensitive information (like law enforcement officers,<sup><a href="#footnote-1756" id="footnote-ref-1756">[1756]</a></sup> airport security screeners,<sup><a href="#footnote-1757" id="footnote-ref-1757">[1757]</a></sup> security guard positions,<sup><a href="#footnote-1758" id="footnote-ref-1758">[1758]</a></sup> bank employees,<sup><a href="#footnote-1759" id="footnote-ref-1759">[1759]</a></sup> port workers,<sup><a href="#footnote-1760" id="footnote-ref-1760">[1760]</a></sup> childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies,<sup><a href="#footnote-1761" id="footnote-ref-1761">[1761]</a></sup> certain insurance personnel,<sup><a href="#footnote-1762" id="footnote-ref-1762">[1762]</a></sup> any personnel involved in administration of an employee benefits plan,<sup><a href="#footnote-1763" id="footnote-ref-1763">[1763]</a></sup> defense contractors,<sup><a href="#footnote-1764" id="footnote-ref-1764">[1764]</a></sup> and prisoner transportation personnel).<sup><a href="#footnote-1765" id="footnote-ref-1765">[1765]</a></sup> For these specialized jobs, a background check is mandatory. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153419"></a>Since employers are allowed to run background checks on me, do I have any legal rights in the process?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes—you have a number of important rights under law THROUGHOUT the hiring process in how the employer can run and use a background check. The following rules protect your rights when you are applying for a job and the employer runs a background check on you through a private Background check company. (Note: There are different rules if the employer runs a background check on a current employee because it suspects the person of misconduct or wrongdoing.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1766" id="footnote-ref-1766">[1766]</a></sup>Before an employer runs a background check on you using a private background check company, the employer must do ALL of the following: give you notice, get your written permission (consent) to run the check, inform you of your rights, and offer you a copy of the report, once it is done.<sup><a href="#footnote-1767" id="footnote-ref-1767">[1767]</a></sup> Here are the 4 steps below in more detail:</p>
<h4 class="step">Give you ADVANCED, WRITTEN NOTICE</h4>
<p class="text">An employer must provide you with written notice if it intends to hire a background check company and use information in your background check to make decisions related to your employment. This notice must be in a separate document from other information from the employer—it can’t just be mentioned on the job application or buried among other papers—SO that it is clear that the employer is running a background check done on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1768" id="footnote-ref-1768">[1768]</a></sup>The NOTICE must include the following INFORMATION:<sup><a href="#footnote-1769" id="footnote-ref-1769">[1769]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Explain the purpose of the background check.Explain that the background check may include information on your “character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living”—meaning certain personal information about you and your past.<sup><a href="#footnote-1770" id="footnote-ref-1770">[1770]</a></sup> Give the name, address, phone number, and website of the private background check company that will conduct the background check. There are many background check companies out there, and you are entitled to know exactly which one is providing a report on you.Explain your right to review the background check company’s files along with all the information the agency used when conducting your background check and preparing your background check report for the employer.<sup><a href="#footnote-1771" id="footnote-ref-1771">[1771]</a></sup> If the report will include information from interviews with your neighbors, friends, or associates, you must be given special notice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1772" id="footnote-ref-1772">[1772]</a></sup></ol>
<h4 class="step">Get WRITTEN PERMISSION from YOU before they run the check: </h4>
<p class="text">After the employer gives you notice, the employer must ask and get your permission in writing—before conducting a background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1773" id="footnote-ref-1773">[1773]</a></sup> Usually, there will be a box to check on the job application, asking you for your permission for the employer to do a background check.</p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If the employer wants to run another background check later…Employers must give you NOTICE and get your PERMISSION EVERY TIME they run a background check.If the employer wants to do another background check later, or wants to get continuous, updated background checks on you during your employment, they must give you a NEW NOTICE AND get NEW written PERMISSION from you each and every time they do a background check (except in cases of suspected misconduct).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1774" id="footnote-ref-1774">[1774]</a></sup></strong></p>
<h4 class="step">Inform you of YOUR RIGHT TO SEE THE INFORMATION in your background check: </h4>
<p class="text">The employer must inform you of your right to see the information used by the Background check company when conducting your background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1775" id="footnote-ref-1775">[1775]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">Offer you a COPY of your background check report:</h4>
<p class="text">The employer must give you a chance to request a copy of the background check report they got. There should be a box you can check to request copy of your report—usually it will be on the same form you sign to give permission for the background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1776" id="footnote-ref-1776">[1776]</a></sup> Always check YES to get a copy of the report so you can see what the employer sees!If you check the box to request a copy of your background check report, the employer must send you a copy of the report within 3 business days from the time when the employer receives it.<sup><a href="#footnote-1777" id="footnote-ref-1777">[1777]</a></sup> </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: ALWAYS request a copy of the background check reportYou have a legal right to receive a copy of the background check report used by the employer, and it is recommended that you always request a copy of the report. Always check the box to request a copy of the background check report.</p>
<ul class="importantbox">WHAT TO LOOK FOR<strong>: </strong>The box to request a copy of the background check report will probably say something like this: “Check this box if you would like to receive a free copy of any consumer report or investigative consumer report obtained on you,” or “I am a California resident and I would like a free copy of my background check report.”<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1778" id="footnote-ref-1778">[1778]</a></sup></strong>Make sure you CHECK THIS BOX to request a copy of your background check report.</ul>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153420"></a>Can an employer decide not to hire me based on my record?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes, BUT ONLY if they follow the law. The law sets certain rules that the employer must follow in the hiring process and in deciding whether to hire someone with a record. The employer must follow additional legal rules both before AND after taking any adverse action against you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1779" id="footnote-ref-1779">[1779]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153421"></a>What rules must an employer follow if they decide not to hire me based on my record?</h3>
<p class="text">Under, federal law (FCRA) the employer must notify you both before AND after taking any adverse (negative) action against you based on the results of your background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1780" id="footnote-ref-1780">[1780]</a></sup> </p>
<h4>BEFORE ADVERSE ACTION:</h4>
<p class="text">Before an employer takes any adverse action against you based on the results of your background check, the employer must give you a “Pre-Adverse Action” letter to notify you that it is planning to take the adverse action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1781" id="footnote-ref-1781">[1781]</a></sup> Under federal law, the Pre-Adverse Action letter must:</p>
<ol class="text">NOTIFY you that the employer plans to take adverse action against you based on information from your background check report;Include a COPY of your background check report that the employer used to make its decision,<sup><a href="#footnote-1782" id="footnote-ref-1782">[1782]</a></sup> and Include the DOCUMENT, “A Summary of Your Rights Under FCRA”<sup><a href="#footnote-1783" id="footnote-ref-1783">[1783]</a></sup> (see Appendix I, PG. 692)</ol>
<p class="text">After you receive this letter, you must be given a reasonable opportunity (about 5 days)<sup><a href="#footnote-1784" id="footnote-ref-1784">[1784]</a></sup> to review your report and correct any errors. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you receive a “Pre-Adverse Action” letter, you should:</p>
<ul class="importantbox">Review your background check report immediately to make sure it does not contain any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated information—such as convictions that are more than 7 years old; convictions that were dismissed/expunged/sealed; and/or arrests that did not lead to a conviction (as long as the charges are not still pending); Tell the employer immediately if there is any incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information in the report;Offer proof of errors in your background check report, such as court records showing the final disposition (outcome) of the case;Offer proof of your rehabilitation efforts, including certifications or documents that show completion of programs, school transcripts, letters of support from past employer or other community members (not family or friends).</ul>
<p class="importantbox">If the employer does not give you enough time to review the report and correct any errors—for example, if the employer gives you the “Pre-Adverse Action” letter and then rejects your job application on the same day—you may have a legal claim against the employer for violating your right to receive notice before the adverse action.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1785" id="footnote-ref-1785">[1785]</a></sup></strong>IMPORTANT: Although the purpose of the Pre-Adverse Action law is to allow you to correct errors in your background check report, the law is NOT clear about whether the employer is required to reconsider your application if you correct the error and provide proof. If this happens to you, you should talk to an attorney about whether the employer may have violated your rights.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1786" id="footnote-ref-1786">[1786]</a></sup></strong> </p>
<h4>AFTER ADVERSE ACTION</h4>
<p class="text">After an employer takes any adverse action against you, such as rejecting your job application or firing you, the employer must give you an “<a id="EM_AdverseActionNotice"></a>Adverse Action Notice” to notify you that an adverse action was taken against you based on information from your background check. The employer can give you this notice orally, in writing, or electronically, but it must be within 3 business days of the employer’s final decision. Under federal law, the Adverse Action Notice must include:</p>
<ol class="text">The name, address, and phone number of the background check company that supplied the report to the employer;A statement that the background check company that supplied the report is not responsible for the adverse action and cannot explain the specific reasons for the action; and A statement of your rights to: Dispute (challenge) the accuracy or completeness of any information the background check company provided; andGet an additional free report from the company within 60 days, if you ask for one.<sup><a href="#footnote-1787" id="footnote-ref-1787">[1787]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">The Adverse Action Notice is important so that you know why the employer made the adverse decision against you and what information the employer considered. This way you can challenge or correct any information that is incorrect, incomplete, or illegal. And if the employer or background check company has NOT followed any of the laws described here—or if the employer does NOT give you an Adverse Action Notice—you may have a legal claim against them. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Adverse Action NoticesIf an employer takes an adverse action against you (such as not hiring you) based on information in your background check report, they must give you BOTH a Pre-Adverse Action AND Adverse Action Notice. If the employer does not give you these documents, you may have a legal claim against them for violating your rights under background check laws. However, you will need to show that they employer’s decision was actually based on information in your background check report (such as your criminal record) and NOT for other reasons. See the text box immediately below on <a id="EM_HH_ShowEmployersDecisionWasBasedOnRec"></a>PG. 623 for how to do this.</p>
<p class="text">For more information on what you can do if an employer does NOT give you an Adverse Action Notice or does NOT follow any of the other laws described here, see PG. 622. For more information on how to challenge or correct information in your background check report, see information below, or see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029.

<h3>What can I do if there is inaccurate, incomplete, or illegal information in my background check report?</h3>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf I did not receive a Pre-Adverse Action or Adverse Action Notice, how can I show that the employer rejected me based on my background check and NOT other reasons?</h4>
<p class="textbox">Here are 2 strategies that have been used for showing that the employer may have rejected you based on your background check, even if they did NOT give you a Pre-Adverse Action or Adverse Action Notice:</p>
<div class="textboxnumber">Did the employer say they would run a background check on you—either in person, on the job posting, or on the job application? Did the employer give you a Notice saying they would run a background check, or have you sign a document giving them permission to run a background check? Did the employer give you a Pre-Adverse Action Notice but NOT Adverse Action Notice (or the opposite—an Adverse Action Notice but NOT Pre-Adverse Action Notice)? Did the employer say anything about your record, or about (not) hiring people with criminal records? Any of these can help show that the employer did run a background check on you, and may have rejected your application based on information in your background check.If you feel comfortable, you can try talking to the employer directly. You can explain that you are trying to improve your application for the future, and then ask why the employer did not select your application and what you can do to improve your chances in the future.In some cases, the employer may say something that reveals he/she made a decision based on your record or other information in your background check—for example, a negative comment about your being trustworthy, creating a risk to others, or about people with criminal records, in general. If this happens, make sure that you write down afterward exactly what the employer said!In other cases, the employer may actually give you a helpful explanation that really can help you to improve your job applications in the future. This may show that the employer really did have some other reason for not hiring you, or at the very least can give you help you to be more successful for future jobs.Finally, the employer may not give you any explanation for their decision, or may simply say that other people were more qualified or applied before you. In this case, it may be difficult to show that the employer actually rejected you based on your background check report. </div>
<p class="text">You have the right to dispute (challenge) any inaccurate, incomplete, or illegally included information in your background check report. If there is inaccurate, incomplete, or illegal information in your background check report, you have the right to dispute (challenge) this information with the background check company that prepared the report. The background check company must investigate the error, delete or correct any improper information, and send a notice and a statement of correction to ANY employer who received a copy of your background check in the past 2 years (or anyone else who received a copy of your background check in the past year) if you ask.<sup><a href="#footnote-1788" id="footnote-ref-1788">[1788]</a></sup> For more information on how to dispute inaccurate, incomplete, or illegally included information in your background check report, see information below, or see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153423"></a>If I am hired, can my employer run background checks on me in the future without my permission?</h3>
<p class="text">No. Under California state law, an employer must follow the legal procedure of giving you notice, getting permission, etc., every time it wants to run a background check on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1789" id="footnote-ref-1789">[1789]</a></sup> In addition, an employer CANNOT ask you to waive (give up) your right to receive notice, give permission, etc., before running a background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1790" id="footnote-ref-1790">[1790]</a></sup>EXCEPTION: If an employer suspects you of wrongdoing or misconduct, it can run a background check without giving you notice or asking for your permission. This exception applies if the employer is conducting a background check because they suspect you of misconduct on the job, including violating any written polices of the employer, or violating any federal, state, or local laws or regulations.<sup><a href="#footnote-1791" id="footnote-ref-1791">[1791]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153424"></a>What can I do if the employer has already received information from a background check report that it shouldn’t have received by law?</h3>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, employers sometimes get information that should NOT have been included in your background check report. They might ask you about it during an interview (or on a job application), or consider the information when deciding whether to hire you. Here are some suggested steps if this happens to you:<strong>STEP 1: </strong>The first recommended step is that you get a copy of the background check report, so that you know what information the employer is seeing. For this reason, it’s important to always check the box to request a copy of the report when you give permission to an employer to run a background check on you.If you didn’t check the box before, you can still get a copy of the report in 2 ways:</p>
<ol class="text">If the employer decides take an adverse (negative) action against you—such as rejecting your job application—they must give you a copy of the background check report before taking the action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1792" id="footnote-ref-1792">[1792]</a></sup>The background check company is required to give you a copy of the same report sent to the employer, if you ask for it within (at least) 2 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-1793" id="footnote-ref-1793">[1793]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text"><strong>STEP 2: </strong>If there are errors or inaccurate information on the background check report, it’s recommended that you point this out to the employer right away. If possible, you may also want to show the employer any proof of the correct information—for example, court papers showing that your conviction has been expunged, or that charges against you were dismissed. You also have the right to make the background check company correct the information, and send the employer a notice and statement of the correction. For more information on correcting information with the background check company and notifying the employer of the correction, see PG. 631 below.<strong>STEP 3:</strong> If the employer asks you about things that should NOT have been in your background check report—such as convictions that are more than 7 years old—it’s recommended you answer the question directly and honestly, but briefly:</p>
<ol class="text">You can take responsibility for your actions. State the facts, but express regret for what happened. Don’t get defensive. Be honest, but don’t go into details. You don’t need to go into details. Keep your answer short. Be honest, but only talk about necessary information based on the questions you are asked.You can the employer how you have changed. Emphasize that the incident happened long ago and that you are a different person now. Explain what you learned while you were in prison/jail, and what you are doing differently now. Paint a picture of the person you are now. You can emphasize your qualifications. Describe the things that will make you a good employee—such as previous work experience, job training programs, or classes that you’ve done—and any letters of recommendation that you have. Show the employer why you are qualified for the position and will be a benefit to the company.You can describe your hopes and dreams. Show the employer than you are in control of your life and have short-term and long-term goals. Highlight any services that you’re getting to help you move on and achieve your goals. Emphasize that you would be very appreciative of the opportunity to work for them, and you will be the hardest worker they will ever have.<sup><a href="#footnote-1794" id="footnote-ref-1794">[1794]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text"><strong>STEP 4: </strong>If the employer asks you (or makes comments) about incorrect or improper information in your background check report, you may want to write down anything the employer says and anything you say to the employer, so that you have a record to protect your rights later.</p>

<h3 class="subheading3">WHAT AN EMPLOYER CAN FIND OUT AND CONSIDER THROUGH THEIR OWN BACKGROUND CHECK INVESTIGATION…AND THE RULES THAT LIMIT THESE SEARCHES.</h3>
<h4 class="textbox">know your rightsGeneral Overview of the Law &amp; your Rights</h4>
<ul class="textbox">Instead of hiring a background check company, employers can also directly access your criminal record and other public records by conducting their own “in-house” background check on you.Employers are NOT required to get your permission before running an in-house background check.You have the RIGHT to receive a COPY of any public information an employer is viewing. It is recommended that you NEVER give up this right!Your RAP sheet is generally confidential and NOT accessible by employers.Your RAP sheet is not the only place to find your criminal records, because most criminal records are public records.If an employer decides not to hire you based on information in a public record (including criminal court records), the employer MUST give you a COPY of the public records.An employer is NOT required to give you copies of any NON-public information used (such as information from talking to people who know you).</ul>
<p class="text">Most employers hire an outside private background check company to gather public record information on job applicants and produce a background check report (this method of running a background check is covered in the previous section, starting on PG. 602).However, instead of hiring an outside background check company, an employer can conduct its own “in-house” (internal) background check on you. The employer can look at your public records directly, as well as interview your friends, family members, and former employers or co-workers. This “in-house” type of background check is a less common practice, but it is important for you to understand that if an employer chooses this route, there are different legal protections than when a private company runs the background check. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153426"></a>How does an in-house background check work?</h3>
<p class="text">An in-house background check is very similar to a third-party background check by an outside Background check company, except the employer alone is responsible for conducting the research, without any outside assistance.Any employer may conduct an in-house background search in the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-1795" id="footnote-ref-1795">[1795]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Looking at public records, such as criminal convictions and civil judgments. You have a right to see any public records that the employer looked at; see PG. 627 below for more information.Talking to friends, neighbors, former employers, or colleagues about your character, reputation, or living situation. The questions should be related to job skills, ability to work with others, attendance, attitude, and ability to follow instructions and receive criticism.Verifying school records—your attendance and any degrees you earned. However, employers cannot see your transcripts (courses and grades) or other school records (e.g., disciplinary records) unless you give written consent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1796" id="footnote-ref-1796">[1796]</a></sup>Online searches—like searching for your name on Google, looking at your Facebook page, checking other social networking sites (Twitter, MySpace, etc.), and checking websites that post mug shots.<sup><a href="#footnote-1797" id="footnote-ref-1797">[1797]</a></sup> Note: An employer cannot ask you for your social networking username or password or make you show them your online profile.<sup><a href="#footnote-1798" id="footnote-ref-1798">[1798]</a></sup></ol>

<p class="text">The law is more relaxed about in-house background checks than it is about outside background check companies’ background checks. This means that you have fewer rights when it comes to being notified, giving your permission, and challenging the results of in-house background checks. However, if an employer is running his/her own in-house background check on you, they still must follow certain rules. Here is what the employer is and isn’t legally required to do:</p>
<ol class="text">The employer may request your permission, but it’s not required. Look carefully at the job application form—the employer might ask to run an in-house background check right on the application form itself.The employer must give you a copy of public records used in the report—unless you check the box to waive (give up) this right. Be careful—the job application or other forms MAY have a box that you can check to waive (give up) your right to see the public records,<sup><a href="#footnote-1799" id="footnote-ref-1799">[1799]</a></sup> and it’s recommended that you do not check that box!</ol>
<p class="importantbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: You can ALWAYS get a copy of PUBLIC RECORDS used by the employer. You have a legal right to get a copy of the public records used by the employer, and it’s recommended that you never give up (“waive”) that right!<strong> </strong>It’s recommended that you always indicate that you DO want to see the public records report, and make sure you DON’T check a box waiving your right. What to look out for: </p>
<ul class="importantbox">The box to waive your rights will probably say something like this: “I further understand that the Company may obtain Public Records about me as part of an internal background investigation and that I may waive my right to receive a copy of such Public Records by checking the box to the right.”<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1800" id="footnote-ref-1800">[1800]</a></sup></strong> It’s recommended that you DON’T CHECK THIS BOX!This can be confusing because it is the opposite of what happens when the employer hires a private background check company to do the background check (in which case <em>it is recommended </em>that you check the box to request a copy of the <em>background check report</em>).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1801" id="footnote-ref-1801">[1801]</a></sup></strong> </ul>
<ol class="text">If you don’t waive your right to view the public records gathered about you, the employer must give you a copy of the public records within 7 days after it receives them.<sup><a href="#footnote-1802" id="footnote-ref-1802">[1802]</a></sup> EXCEPTION: In California, if your existing or future employer wants to run an in-house background check because it suspects you of misconduct or wrongdoing, the employer is not required to reveal its findings until after the investigation is over. However, upon completion of the investigation, the employer must give you a copy of the public records unless you waived (gave up) your rights (so again, its recommended that you don’t give up your right to a copy of those public records!).<sup><a href="#footnote-1803" id="footnote-ref-1803">[1803]</a></sup> If the employer takes any adverse (negative) action against you—such as deciding not to hire you—because of information in the public records, the employer must give you a copy of the public records even if you checked the box that waived your right to see the records.<sup><a href="#footnote-1804" id="footnote-ref-1804">[1804]</a></sup><br/>The employer is not required to give you information it gets from NON-PUBLIC sources, such as checking your references with past employers, verifying your education records, or talking to people who know you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1805" id="footnote-ref-1805">[1805]</a></sup> </ol>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTImportant things to know about listing references and previous jobs</h4>
<p class="textbox">When you apply for a job, the new employer will often contact your former employers and other people you list as references, in order to find out if you were a good employee and to decide if they should hire you. Keep in mind that a former employer CAN say negative things about you as part of a job reference even suspected criminal activity, regardless of whether you were convicted of anything—so long as they reasonably believe the information is true and they are not simply acting out of meanness towards you.Also, the new employer is NOT required to tell you what these people said about you, and they can say positive or negative things. It’s recommended that you check in with your references BEFORE listing them, so that you know what they will say about you. (You can also ask someone you trust—a case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or friend—to call for you.) Finally, the new employer will also check the dates when you worked at your previous jobs and how much you earned—so make sure you know the EXACT dates and amount you earned, or it could seem like you are being dishonest in a new job application. For more information about listing references and previous jobs on a job application, see PG. 607.</p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153428"></a>Errors in employers' in-house background checks:</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153429"></a>How can I find out if an employer relied on incorrect public records about me?</h3>
<p class="text">As noted above, if an employer runs its own background check—instead of hiring an agency to do a consumer report—it must disclose to you any public records it relies on. Specifically, the employer is required to ask you whether you want copies of these public records. If you checked “yes” when asked whether you want a copy (which it is recommended that you do), by law the employer must send you the public records in the mail and give you the opportunity to examine them thoroughly. If you find incorrect or misleading information, you can inform your employer about the false information, so he or she does not rely on it as accurate. Then you can attempt to get the errors fixed.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153430"></a>If an employer relied on inaccurate public records, what can I do? </h3>
<p class="text">If an employer ran his/her own background check and relied on inaccurate public records, you can:</p>
<ol class="text">Contact your employer as soon as possible, to prevent any confusion.Send a written letter or e-mail (“written notice”) to the employer, pointing out the incorrect or incomplete records, and request that the employer re-investigate the records.Provide the employer with proof, including copies of any official documents to show why the information is incorrect, outdated, or incomplete. (For example: you could give the employer court papers showing that your convictions have been dismissed or “expunged” in some way.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1806" id="footnote-ref-1806">[1806]</a></sup>You can fix the errors in your public records by contacting the agency that produced the incorrect record. For example, if you need to fix incorrect information about a tax lien, contact the IRS; if you need to fix the record of a legal matter (civil or criminal case), contact the clerk at the courthouse that processed your legal case. </ol>
<p class="text">It is important to remember that you only have the legal right to know about public records that an employer uses. If an employer chooses to investigate your past on its own, they do NOT need to disclose any information learned through in-person interviews with your former bosses or family and friends.<sup><a href="#footnote-1807" id="footnote-ref-1807">[1807]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="EM_RAP_Sheet"></a><a id="_Toc448153431"></a>Can an employer ask me for or consider my RAP sheet?</h3>
<p class="text">Usually, no. Most employers are not allowed to see or ask for your RAP sheet. Your RAP sheet is the government’s official record of all your arrests, convictions, and other criminal justice contact. (Your RAP sheet is a confidential document, meaning most people and most employers are not allowed to see it or ask about it! Still, there are many other ways for employers to see your criminal record without ever looking at your official government RAP sheet—such as checking court and public records (see PG. 627) or hiring a private Background check company to do a background check (see PG. 633).</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153432"></a>Which employers can see my RAP sheet?</h3>
<p class="text">Under California law, only certain people are allowed to see your RAP sheet for employment purposes:<sup><a href="#footnote-1808" id="footnote-ref-1808">[1808]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Most public employers can see your RAP sheet. These include all federal, state and local government agencies—including police and fire departments, the California Department of Corrections (CDCR), local Boards of Education, and the U.S. Postal Service.<sup><a href="#footnote-1809" id="footnote-ref-1809">[1809]</a></sup>Certain private employers can see your RAP sheet if you are applying for a job that involves access to sensitive information (e.g., nuclear power plants, public utilities, private security companies, and financial institutions like banks) OR you will be working with children, elderly, disabled, or other vulnerable people.<sup><a href="#footnote-1810" id="footnote-ref-1810">[1810]</a></sup>State occupational licensing agencies<sup><a href="#footnote-1811" id="footnote-ref-1811">[1811]</a></sup> can see your RAP sheet if you apply for a professional license. For more information on licensing restrictions based on a criminal record, see PG. 652.Law enforcement &amp; criminal justice agencies<sup><a href="#footnote-1812" id="footnote-ref-1812">[1812]</a></sup> have full access to your RAP sheet, including juvenile cases, expunged/dismissed cases, and sometimes even sealed records! </ol>
<p class="text">In order to get a copy of your RAP sheet, these employers are allowed to ask for your fingerprints, including making you do Live Scan (electronic) fingerprinting.<sup><a href="#footnote-1813" id="footnote-ref-1813">[1813]</a></sup>It is illegal for a regular employer (i.e., NOT an employer listed above) to do any of the following:</p>
<ol class="text">Ask you for a copy of your RAP sheet;Get a copy of your RAP sheet through any other means; orMake you prove that you do NOT have a record—for example, by requiring you to get fingerprinted, or asking you for a “notice of no record”.<sup><a href="#footnote-1814" id="footnote-ref-1814">[1814]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153433"></a>Can I see my own RAP sheet<a id="EM_SeeYourRapSheet_CorrectErrors"></a>?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes. You have the right to get a copy of your own RAP sheet, and to correct any errors or inaccurate information in it.<sup><a href="#footnote-1815" id="footnote-ref-1815">[1815]</a></sup> To request a copy of your RAP sheet, you will need to fill out an application from the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and get fingerprinted, and then send your application and fingerprints to DOJ.<sup><a href="#footnote-1816" id="footnote-ref-1816">[1816]</a></sup> You will also have to pay a fee of no more than $25.<sup><a href="#footnote-1817" id="footnote-ref-1817">[1817]</a></sup> For information on how to request a copy of your RAP sheet, see the Key Terms section on PG. 612.To correct an error in your RAP sheet, you will need to send a written letter to the DOJ to explain what the error is, and where to find evidence or proof of the correct information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1818" id="footnote-ref-1818">[1818]</a></sup> For example, if your RAP sheet says that you were charged with a certain crime, but you actually plead guilty to a lesser offense, you can tell the DOJ to contact the court clerk to prove the final disposition (outcome) of your case.Important: Even though you are allowed to get a copy of your own RAP sheet, it is illegal for you to give a copy of your RAP sheet to an employer (unless it’s an employer who is already allowed to see your RAP sheet, as listed on PG. 630 above).<sup><a href="#footnote-1819" id="footnote-ref-1819">[1819]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153434"></a>What can I do if the employer does not follow any of these rules on background checks?</h3>
<p class="text">Employers that do not follow federal and state laws for conducting background checks on you may be liable to you and to the government for their illegal actions.</p>
<h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSSome ways an employer can violate background check laws: </h4>

<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you want to sue the employer—BEWARE!<em>(1) It’s expensive.</em> Suing an employer will likely cost a LOT of time and money, and your recovery options are limited.<em>(2) No frivolous lawsuits are allowed. </em>The Federal Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) includes a penalty for filing a lawsuit or related court papers that are filed in “bad faith or for purposes of harassment.” You may have to pay the other side’s attorney’s fees, along with your own, if you file a lawsuit to harass an employer and lose. </p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Talk to the employer.</span> The first thing you can do is try to talk to the employer directly.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153438"></a>What can a background check company report about me to an employer?</h3>
<p class="text">Most importantly for the purposes of this manual, under California law, the only information about your criminal history that background check companies are allowed to include in a background check is </p>
<ol class="text">Information on convictions that are less than 7 years old, and Arrests and formal charges filed against you if a judgment is still pending.<sup><a href="#footnote-1828" id="footnote-ref-1828">[1828]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="text">For further information on what can be included in your background check, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153439"></a>What can a background check company <em>not</em> report about me to an employer?</h3>
<p class="text">Although some background check companies brag that they can “find out anything about anyone,” both federal and California laws impose restrictions on what information they are allowed to put in your background check, especially when it relates to your criminal history. For example, Background check companies are NOT allowed to include information about criminal convictions that are more than seven years old,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1829" id="footnote-ref-1829">[1829]</a></sup></sup> convictions that were pardoned, dismissed or sealed, arrest records, or referrals to diversion programs.</p>
<p class="importantbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: Background check companies MUST verify certain information to make sure it is accurate! If a Background check company includes information that is a matter of public record in your background check (such as information about your convictions), it must have verified the information within the previous 30 days before issuing its report. Additionally, a Background check company cannot include negative information about you that it got from talking to a person who knows you (for example, a former employer or a neighbor) UNLESS it has tried to confirm that information from another source, or has determined that that person is the best (or only) source of the information.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1830" id="footnote-ref-1830">[1830]</a></sup></strong></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153440"></a>What can I do if I think my background check report is incomplete or incorrect?</h3>
<p class="text">You can challenge it! If you dispute Information in your background check, a background check company must investigate your claim. If you notify a background check company in writing that information contained in your background check is incomplete, incorrect, or illegally included, the agency must investigate your claim.<sup><a href="#footnote-1831" id="footnote-ref-1831">[1831]</a></sup> The agency has 30 days from the day it receives your challenge to begin its investigation. Once the investigation is complete, the agency must notify you of the results within 5 days.If the agency finds that the original information was inaccurate, incomplete, or illegally included, it MUST delete or correct the information AND notify you of the correction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1832" id="footnote-ref-1832">[1832]</a></sup> </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The background check company MUST send the employer a NOTICE OF the CORRECTION if you ask.

<p class="text">This section will explain the laws on how employers can (and can’t) use your criminal history to make employment decisions, and what you can do if you think an employer has illegally discriminated against you. In general, the law says that employers should only consider your criminal history if it directly relates to your ability to do the job, and cannot use your criminal record to discriminate based on your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. However, there is often a gap between what the law says on paper—about your rights as a job applicant or employee, and about the employer’s duties to treat you fairly—and how employers act in real life. It can also be difficult to <em>prove</em> that an employer has illegally discriminated against you, which can make it difficult to enforce your rights. But it is IMPORTANT for you to know what your rights are on paper, and know how to spot illegal discrimination and protect yourself from illegal practices as much as possible.</p>

<ul class="textbox">An employer CAN run a background check on you.An employer CAN consider some parts of your criminal history and use it to deny you a job—so long as the denial would be allowed under the law.An employer CANNOT weigh your conviction history more heavily than another candidate’s similar conviction history because of your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.An employer CANNOT deny employment to everyone with a criminal history.An employer, however, CAN justify a hiring policy against people with criminal histories if it shows the policy is “job related” and “consistent with business necessity.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1845" id="footnote-ref-1845">[1845]</a></sup> An employer SHOULD evaluate your individual circumstances and consider: Facts and circumstances surrounding your offense;The number of convictions in your history;Your age at the time of conviction / release;If you have held the same type of job, post-conviction, without incidents;Your employment history before and after conviction;Your rehabilitation efforts;Employment or character references and any other information pointing to your fitness for the position; andWhether you are bonded.<sup><a href="#footnote-1846" id="footnote-ref-1846">[1846]</a></sup>An employer SHOULD give you notice that you were denied employment because of your criminal history, and also give you a chance to show that it should make an exception for you based on your individual circumstances.</ul>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153445"></a>Can employers legally discriminate against me (such as not hiring or firing me) just because of my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">In a few situations, yes, but usually, NO. There are some laws that protect applicants from this type of employment discrimination. While employers can legally consider convictions that might impact your ability to do the duties of the job safely and adequately, there are civil rights laws that make it illegal for employers to treat you differently from other applicants or employees based on your race, sex, religion, national origin, and other protected characteristics (called “protected classes”).While it is sometimes legal for an employer to not hire or fire you because of your criminal record, an employer’s hiring policy is more likely to be illegal if they have a <strong>complete ban (called a “blanket ban”)</strong> on job applicants with records. Under law, the correct and legal practice is for the employer to consider <strong>the individual circumstances of the person applying for the job</strong> and <strong>the job itself</strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1847" id="footnote-ref-1847">[1847]</a></sup> In most cases, it is illegal for an employer to have a complete or “blanket” ban on applicants with criminal records because these kinds of bans cause greater harm to Black and Latino applicants (“protected classes”) under a federal civil rights law known as “Title VII” (this law is explained in more detail in Appendix J, PG. 695)<sup><a href="#footnote-1848" id="footnote-ref-1848">[1848]</a></sup> Because Blacks and Latinos are incarcerated at dramatically higher rates than people of other races in the United States,<sup><a href="#footnote-1849" id="footnote-ref-1849">[1849]</a></sup> excluding applicants with criminal records is likely to have a greater impact on these protected classes. Under law then, a <strong>“blanket ban”</strong> is only legal if the employer can show that the ban is <strong>“job related”</strong> and <strong>“consistent with business necessity”</strong>—meaning that your conviction affects your ability to do specific duties of the job, and the ban is necessary for the good of the business.<sup><a href="#footnote-1850" id="footnote-ref-1850">[1850]</a></sup> If an employer chooses not to hire individuals based solely on their records, the employer must be able to show that that this is necessary to ensure safe and efficient job performance<sup> </sup>for the position in question.<sup><a href="#footnote-1851" id="footnote-ref-1851">[1851]</a></sup> In doing so, and employer must show that they evaluated the applicant’s ability to perform the duties of the job and whether any past conviction(s) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm, based on the specific requirements and responsibilities of the position.<sup><a href="#footnote-1852" id="footnote-ref-1852">[1852]</a></sup> Of course, these laws still give the employer a lot of discretion and room to discriminate, but they require the employer to do individualized analysis of each job applicant.</p>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT: What does a complete ban look like? </h4>
<p class="textbox">Sometimes the employer’s job posting, employment application, written policy, or some other part of the application process will show that the employer does not hire or employ people with criminal records. The policy may apply to all convictions, certain types of convictions (e.g., all felonies, or all theft offenses), and/or for convictions that occurred during a certain period of time (e.g., within the past 7 years). Or the policy may not be written down anywhere, but the employer says that they do not hire people with (certain) criminal records, or the employer’s hiring practices over time show that they always reject applicants with (certain) conviction records. These are all examples of complete bans—and are likely illegal because of their effect on minority, protected groups.</p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you see something, you can say something!This section explains the civil rights laws that protect people with criminal records against discrimination by employers. However, there is often a gap between what the law says employers SHOULD do, and what employers ACTUALLY do. The courts are still figuring out how civil rights laws protect people with criminal records in different situations, because many of the cases on this subject are new. For this reason, it’s important that you talk to a lawyer and/or contact the appropriate government-run civil rights protection agency if you think an employer has violated your rights. You won’t just be protecting your own rights—you’ll be standing up for the rights of all people with criminal records to be free from employment discrimination!</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153446"></a>What laws protect applicants from discrimination based on their criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">The laws that give applicants with records some protection are (1) the federal civil rights law called “Title VII,” (2) the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) Enforcement Guidance on Title VII,<sup><a href="#footnote-1853" id="footnote-ref-1853">[1853]</a></sup> and (3) California state laws that are very similar to these federal laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-1854" id="footnote-ref-1854">[1854]</a></sup> Learn more about these laws in the Appendix J, PG. 695 and Appendix K, PG. 696.Under these civil rights laws, an employer CANNOT have a <a id="EM_BlanketBan"></a><strong>“blanket ban”</strong> policy that permanently excludes anyone and everyone with a criminal record. Instead, the employer’s hiring policy should only exclude convictions that are “job related for the position” and “consistent with business necessity.” This means that the employer should look at a number of factors when considering the convictions, such as:</p>
<ol class="text"><strong>The nature and seriousness of the conviction, ANDHow much time has passed since the conviction, conduct, or completion of the sentence, ANDThe nature of the job you’re seeking—including the specific duties and responsibilities of the job.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1855" id="footnote-ref-1855">[1855]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">For a more detailed description of how employers should look at these factors, see the rules below.</p>
<h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_HH_ProtectedClass"></a>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS:What is a protected class?</h4>
<p class="textbox">“Protected classes” are groups of people that have historically experienced discrimination, and therefore are specifically protected by civil rights and anti-discrimination laws—for example, African Americans, women, immigrants, LGBTQI individuals, and people with disabilities. The specific characteristic that makes someone part of a protected class—for example, their race, sex, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identity, and/or disability status. Under the law, it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on a protected characteristic. However, it is generally NOT illegal to discriminate against someone for some other reason that is NOT protected (for example, the color of their shirt).IMPORTANT: Having a criminal record is NOT considered a protected class under the law. However, discriminating against people with criminal records can still be illegal in many situations because it has a much greater effect on Blacks and Latinos. Also, it is illegal for an employer to treat people with similar records in a different manner, based on any protected characteristics. For more information about different kinds of discrimination based on criminal record, see PG. 643 below.What groups are “protected classes” under the law? Under federal law, it is illegal to discriminate against someone for any of the following reasons:</p>
<table><tr><td><ul class="textbox">RaceColorNational origin</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">ReligionAge (40 and over)Sex</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">PregnancyDisabilityGenetic information</ul></td></tr></table>
<p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">Under California law</span>, it is illegal to discriminate against someone for any of the following reasons:</p>
<table><tr><td><ul class="textbox">RaceColorNational origin or ancestry*Religion</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">SexPregnancyFamily or marital status*Sexual orientation* Gender identity*</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">Disability or medical condition*Genetic informationMilitary or veteran status*Age (40 and over)</ul></td></tr></table>
<p class="textbox">In other words, California law protects all of the same characteristics as federal law, plus additional characteristics (marked with a *star*) that are NOT protected by federal law.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153447"></a>Can an employer have a policy that excludes applicants who committed certain specific crimes?</h3>
<p class="text">Maybe. If an employment policy excludes ALL applicants who committed a certain crime (for example, theft), the employer must show that anyone who committed that crime can’t do the job properly or creates too much risk of harm in the position.<sup><a href="#footnote-1856" id="footnote-ref-1856">[1856]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153448"></a>What can an employer consider about my criminal history?</h3>
<p class="text">Under the law, an employer SHOULD evaluate you as an individual, and should consider the circumstances of your criminal history, as well as any progress that you have made since the offense. To conduct an individual assessment of you as a job applicant/ employee, the employer should abide by these rules:<sup> <sup><a href="#footnote-1857" id="footnote-ref-1857">[1857]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ol class="text"><strong><em>Never make a permanent exclusion or “blanket ban” of people with criminal records.</em></strong> See PG. 640 above for more information on blanket bans.<strong><em>Consider the following 3 factors to determine whether a specific conviction may be relevant to the job:</em></strong><span class="emphasisitalic"><strong>The nature and seriousness of the conviction. </strong></span>The “nature” of the crime includes things like: the harm caused by the crime, and the legal elements of a crime—such as violence, theft, or fraud. The “seriousness” of the crime would include, for example, consideration that misdemeanors may be less severe than felonies.<span class="emphasisitalic"><strong>How much time has passed since the conviction, conduct, or completion of the sentence.</strong></span>Again, there should be no permanent exclusions of people with criminal records.The employer should understand that the risk of recidivism decreases over time.<span class="emphasisitalic"><strong>The nature of the job that you are seeking—including the specific duties and responsibilities of the job.</strong></span>The job title and nature of duties (e.g., data entry, lifting boxes);The job’s essential or most important functions;The circumstances under which the job is performed (e.g., the level of supervision, oversight, and the amount of agency the employee has);The environment in which the job’s duties are performed (e.g., outside, in a warehouse, or in a private home).<strong><em>Look at individual factors like:</em></strong>The total number of convictions on your record; Your age at the time of conviction or release from prison;Evidence that you did the same type of work after your conviction (with the same or a different employer) with no known incidents of criminal conduct;The length and consistency of your employment history before and after the offense or conduct;Evidence of your rehabilitation and efforts to change—for example, education/training;Mistakes in your criminal record;Mitigating facts or circumstances surrounding the offense or conduct (mitigating facts are things that show your crime should be considered in a less harsh light; for example, if you were the victim of abuse or coercion at the time of the offense);Personal and professional references who can talk about your employment record and character, and any other information regarding your fitness for a particular job;<sup> </sup>andWhether you are bonded under a federal, state, or local bonding program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1858" id="footnote-ref-1858">[1858]</a></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153449"></a>How can I improve my chances of getting hired if the employer sees my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">When applying for jobs, keep these individual factors in mind. Highlight the positive elements in your application and history so that employers are more likely to consider and weigh them favorably. Don’t lie about your background, but you can explain how it has made you a better person and worker. For more information about how to talk about your record, see Appendix D, PG. 680, “How to Present your Best Self: Tips for Success in Job Interview.” </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153450"></a>What can I do if I believe that an employer has a complete ban on hiring people with records?</h3>
<p class="text">If you believe that there is an illegal ban in place, it is important for you to gather all of your job application materials and other (detailed) evidence that supports your claim. You can also contact an employment attorney or agency that protects employees from discrimination. See the “Helpful Hint” box on PG. 651 above for how to contact one. The following evidence can help you to show that the employer has a policy of rejecting applicants with (certain) criminal records:</p>
<ol class="text">A job posting that says the employer will not hire people with (certain) criminal records;A copy of the job application that says the employer will not hire people with (certain) criminal records;A copy of the employer’s written policy, employee handbook, or other document saying the employer will not hire people with (certain) criminal records;Information about other applicants whom the employer has hired or rejected for having a criminal record;If the employer has a reputation in the community for not hiring people with (certain) criminal records; and/orComments or statements by the employer about not hiring people with (certain) criminal records, such as during an interview or when inquiring about the job—make sure you write it down! Try to write down exactly what the employer said, when, whom the employer was speaking to, what the circumstances were, and who else was there.<sup><a href="#footnote-1859" id="footnote-ref-1859">[1859]</a></sup></ol>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="EM_Discrimination_Situations"></a><a id="_Toc448153451"></a><em>Real-life situations—</em>examples of discrimination involving criminal record plus race (or other protected characteristics)</h1>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: In real life, discrimination based on your criminal record doesn’t always happen alone—it may also happen in combination with racial discrimination or other illegal discrimination based on your protected class. For example, if an employer decides not to hire you due to your criminal record AND your race, this would be ILLEGAL racial discrimination.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153452"></a>Can an employer discriminate against me because of my race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin?</h3>
<p class="text">No. Sometimes there is racism (or other discrimination against a protected class) in addition to discrimination based on criminal history. This happens when an employer weighs your criminal history more heavily or negatively <em>because</em> of your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected class. This is absolutely illegal, but needs to be proven. The next question will explain what to do and how you may be able to prove that an employer used your criminal record to discriminate against you based on your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, or other protected class. <span class="emphasisitalic">Remember:</span> Race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and national origin are all protected classes—meaning they are illegal reasons to discriminate against someone. For more information, and a complete list of all protected classes, see PG. 640 above. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153453"></a>What can I do if I think an employer has treated my criminal history more harshly than other job applicants because of my race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or national origin?</h3>
<p class="text">If you believe that your criminal history was treated more harshly than someone else’s similar criminal history because of your race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nation origin, etc., it is important for you to gather all the evidence that supports your claim, especially any information showing that the employer treated you differently than someone else with a similar record. You can also contact an employment attorney or organization that specializes in protecting employees from discrimination. See PG. 651 for how to contact someone.The following evidence can help you to show that the employer discriminated against you by treating your criminal record differently because of your race, sex, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristic:</p>
<ol class="text">The employer hired other job applicants or employees with similar criminal records and similar job qualifications; The employer did not require background checks for other job applicants for the same position; The employer gave other job applicants a chance to explain their criminal record; The employer made comments showing bias or stereotypes about you, based on your race, sex, religion, or national origin, including group stereotypes about crime; orThe only major difference between you and other applicants or employees who were treated more favorably than you (such as job applicants chosen over you, former employees, and employees in positions similar to the position you applied for), is your race, sex, religion, national origin, or other protected characteristic;Information about the employer’s overall workforce (i.e., other employees), job applicants, application procedures, and background check data, shows that the employer treated your criminal history more negatively than other applicants/employees of other races, sex, religions, or national origin; and/orAny other information showing that the employer treated you differently than other job applicants with similar qualifications and a similar criminal record, because of your race, sex, religion, or national origin.<sup><a href="#footnote-1860" id="footnote-ref-1860">[1860]</a></sup></ol>
<h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS</h4>
<ul class="textbox">An employer CANNOT discriminate against you based on your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic.An employer CANNOT weigh your criminal history more heavily than another applicant’s similar criminal history because of your race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic.An employer CANNOT deny employment to everyone with a criminal history.An employer, however, CAN justify a hiring policy against people with criminal histories if it shows the policy is “job related” and “consistent with business necessity.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1861" id="footnote-ref-1861">[1861]</a></sup> An employer SHOULD evaluate your individual circumstances and consider: Facts and circumstances surrounding your offense;The number of convictions in your history;Your age at the time of conviction / release;If you have held the same type of job, post-conviction, without incidents;Your employment history before and after conviction;Your rehabilitation efforts;Employment or character references and any other information pointing to your fitness for the position; andWhether you are bonded.<sup><a href="#footnote-1862" id="footnote-ref-1862">[1862]</a></sup>An employer SHOULD give you notice that you were denied employment because of your criminal history, and give you a chance to show that it should make an exception for you based on your individual circumstances.</ul>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153454"></a>What can I do if I feel I was illegally discriminated against? </h3>
<p class="text">If you think that an employer has illegally discriminated against you either because of a complete ban against people with criminal records or by treating your record negatively because of your race, sex, religion, or national origin, etc., you can report the employer to the EEOC or DFEH as soon as possible. (Remember, the EEOC and DFEH are the government civil rights agencies responsible for enforcing your rights against discrimination.)You may want to talk to a legal aid or employment attorney, or non-profit advocacy organization about your situation. However, you will still have to go through the EEOC or DFEH first, before you are allowed to file a lawsuit in court against the employer. For this reason, it is recommended that you contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately, and then you can talk to a lawyer as well. For more information about finding a legal aid or employment attorney or non-profit organization, see PG. 651. For more information about filing a lawsuit, see PG. 646.You must contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately because there are strict time limits for filing an employment discrimination complaint. In California, you only have 300 days (10 months) to report discrimination to the EEOC, or 1 year to report discrimination to the DFEH.<sup><a href="#footnote-1863" id="footnote-ref-1863">[1863]</a></sup> </p>
<h4 class="textbox">File a Complaint by Contacting the federal EEOC:</h4>
<p class="textbox">If you decide to file a claim, you can contact the EEOC in person or by mail to report the employment discrimination and file a complaint.</p>
<ul class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">In person:</span> The EEOC has local offices in the following California cities: Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. Contact the local EEOC office near you to report discrimination and file a complaint. (See Appendix L, PG. 698 for local EEOC office addresses and phone numbers.) You can also call 1-800-669-4000 to give basic information about your situation, and then a local office will follow up with you about filing a complaint.

<a id="_Toc448153455"></a>
<h3>What kinds of remedies might I get if an employer illegally discriminated against me? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">Limits On Compensatory &amp; Punitive Damages:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">There are limits on the amount of compensatory and punitive damages a person can recover. These limits depend on the size of the employer:</p>
<ul class="sidebox">For employers with 15-100 employees, the limit is $50,000.For employers with 101-200 employees, the limit is $100,000.For employers with 201-500 employees, the limit is $200,000.For employers with more than 500 employees, the limit is $300,000.</ul>
<p class="sidebox">42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3)</p>
<p class="text">The types of remedies that might be available to you will depend upon what the employer did (the “discriminatory action”) and how it affected you. For example, if an employer refused to hire you for an illegally discriminatory reason, the remedy may include hiring you for the job or giving you any back pay or benefits that you would have received if you had been hired. If you filed a lawsuit in court, you may also get back any money you spent on attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and court costs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1866" id="footnote-ref-1866">[1866]</a></sup>You also may be awarded “compensatory” or “punitive damages.” For intentional cases of discrimination based on a person's race, color, national origin, sex (including pregnancy), religion, disability, or genetic information, compensatory and punitive damages may be awarded. Note: punitive and compensatory damages are rare, and should never be expected.</p>
<ol class="text">Compensatory damages repay victims for out-of-pocket expenses caused by the discrimination (such as costs of continuing with a job search) and compensate them for any emotional harm suffered because of the discrimination.Punitive damages may be awarded to punish an employer who has committed an especially hateful or careless act of discrimination.</ol>
<p class="text">In addition, the employer may be required to stop any discriminatory practices immediately and take steps to make sure not to discriminate again in the future. For example, if the employer had a blanket policy of not hiring anyone with a criminal record, they would have to change this policy and remove any language on the job application that says people with convictions will not be hired. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153456"></a>What is the difference between an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint and a Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) complaint?</h3>
<p class="text">The EEOC is the federal civil rights agency that enforces federal civil rights law. The DFEH is the state civil rights agency that enforces California civil rights law.Federal and state civil rights laws are very similar. This means that in most cases, you can file a discrimination complaint with either the EEOC or the DFEH. Once you file a complaint with one agency, that agency will investigate your complaint and will ALSO send a copy of your complaint to the other agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-1867" id="footnote-ref-1867">[1867]</a></sup> This is called “dual filing,” but it is NOT something that you need to worry or about. Once you file a complaint with either the EEOC or DFEH, the agencies will take care of filing it with the other agency on its own, and you will not need to do anything else. However, there are certain situations where it is better to file with one agency than the other. <em>THIS CHART EXPLAINS SOME OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO FILE WITH ONE AGENCY (USUALLY THE DFEH) OVER THE OTHER AGENCY:</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1868" id="footnote-ref-1868">[1868]</a></sup></p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153457"></a>How do I file a discrimination complaint with the EEOC?</h3>
<h4>In Person: </h4>
<p class="text">Contact the local EEOC office near you to report the discrimination and make an appointment. Some EEOC offices may also have walk-in times when you can file a complaint without an appointment. Check with the local office to find out if this is available. (For a list of local EEOC offices and contact information, see Appendix L, PG. 698.)When you go to the EEOC office, bring any information or papers that are related to your situation. For example, you might bring a copy of the job posting or application, any letters or documents you received from the employer, notes that you took about discriminatory statements made by the employer, or a list of other people who know about what happened. You can also bring anyone you want to come with you, such as a friend, translator, or anyone else to provide assistance or support.</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">What if the EEOC dismisses my complaint right away? </h4>
<p class="sidebox">If your complaint was not filed within the time limit, or if the EEOC decides that your situation is not covered by Title VII, the EEOC will dismiss your complaint (close your case) right away. The EEOC may also dismiss your complaint right away if it decides that it probably will not be able to prove discrimination. If your charge is dismissed, you will be notified.<span class="emphasisitalic">Important:</span> Even if the EEOC dismisses your complaint, you may still be able to file a complaint with the DFEH for the same discrimination. </p>
<p class="text">At the EEOC office, you will meet with an EEOC representative and complete a questionnaire to provide information about the job discrimination you experienced. The representative will ask you for details about your experience, the employer, and when and where the discrimination occurred, and will decide whether Title VII covers your situation. If so, the EEOC representative will explain the process for filing a formal complaint, called a "Charge of Discrimination," and will help you to write up and file the complaint if you want to go forward. (If Title VII does not cover your situation, the EEOC will give you information about where you can go for help, but you will not be able to file an EEOC complaint.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1875" id="footnote-ref-1875">[1875]</a></sup></p>
<h4>By Mail:</h4>
<p class="text">You can file a complaint by writing a letter to the EEOC that includes the following information:</p>
<ol class="text">Your name, address, and telephone number;The name, address and telephone number of the employer whom you want to file your charge against; How many employees work there (if you know this information);A description of the actions that you believe were discriminatory (for example, you were fired, demoted, harassed, or not hired);Why you believe you were discriminated against (for example, the employer hired other people with a similar criminal history, or did not require background checks for other applicants, or gave other applicants a chance to explain their conviction record; or the employer made biased comments);When the events took place; andYour signature (Important: The EEOC cannot investigate your complaint unless you sign the letter!).<sup><a href="#footnote-1876" id="footnote-ref-1876">[1876]</a></sup>You can also include additional information or documents, such as copies of the job posting or application or names and contact information of other people who know what happened or have information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1877" id="footnote-ref-1877">[1877]</a></sup> (Important: If you are sending documents, make sure you make a copy first—keep the original for yourself and send the copy to the EEOC.)</ol>
<p class="text">You can mail your letter or deliver it in person to the nearest EEOC office. The EEOC will contact you if they need more information about your situation and may send you a questionnaire to fill out and return. Afterward, they will put all your information into an official EEOC complaint (“charge”) form, and will contact you so that you can sign the form.<sup><a href="#footnote-1878" id="footnote-ref-1878">[1878]</a></sup>Note: You can also call the EEOC at 1-800-669-4000 to start the process, but you will still have to go through the steps above to file a formal written complaint.<sup><a href="#footnote-1879" id="footnote-ref-1879">[1879]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153458"></a>What happens after I file a complaint with the EEOC?</h3>
<p class="text">This is a brief summary of what happens after you file a complaint. For a complete description of each step, see Appendix O, PG. 701.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153459"></a>How does the investigation process work? </h3>
<h4 class="step">Filing a Complaint (see above).Notifying the Employer. </h4>
<p class="text">Within 10 days, the EEOC will send a notice and a copy of the charge to the employer. The EEOC may ask both you and the employer to agree to participate in mediation, which is an informal way of trying to resolve the problem instead of filing a lawsuit. </p>
<h4 class="step">Employer’s Response. </h4>
<p class="text">If your case is not sent to mediation, or if mediation doesn’t resolve the problem, the EEOC will ask the employer to respond (submit a written answer) to the charges, and answer any questions that the EEOC has about your complaint. Then your complaint will be given to an EEOC investigator for investigation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1880" id="footnote-ref-1880">[1880]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">Investigation. </h4>
<p class="text">How the EEOC investigates a complaint depends on the specific facts of your case and the kinds of information that will be helpful. In some cases, an EEOC representative may visit the employer, interview other employees or witnesses, and gather documents. The EEOC may also interview you again, or ask you for more documents or information. It’s very important to cooperate and keep in touch with the EEOC! </p>
<h4 class="step">Decision. </h4>
<p class="text">After the investigation is completed, the EEOC will issue a decision to let you and the employer know the results. The decision will say either:</p>
<ol class="text">NO CAUSE—meaning the EEOC did NOT find any evidence that the employer illegally discriminated against you; orREASONABLE CAUSE—meaning the EEOC thinks the employer DID illegally discriminate against you.</ol>
<h4 class="step">Your Options After the EEOC Decision. </h4>
<p class="text">Depending on what the EEOC decision says, these are your options:</p>
<ol class="text">NO CAUSE decision—The EEOC will send you a Right-to-Sue notice, which allows you to file a lawsuit in court against the employer on your own. You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) after receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late. REASONABLE CAUSE decision—The EEOC will try to reach a voluntary settlement (called “conciliation”) with the employer. Conciliation usually means that the employer agrees to pay you to cover the harm from the discrimination. If the EEOC can’t reach a settlement with the employer, the EEOC may decide to file a lawsuit against the employer on your behalf. If the EEOC decides not to file a lawsuit, it will give you a Right-to-Sue notice, which allows you to file a lawsuit against the employer on your own. You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) of receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late.<sup><a href="#footnote-1881" id="footnote-ref-1881">[1881]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">For more information about each of these steps, see Appendix O, PG. 701.</p>
<a id="_Toc448153460"></a>
<h3>How do I file a complaint with the DFEH?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Even though you can’t go straight to court, you can still talk to a legal aid or employment attorney, or non-profit employment advocacy organization to get advice about your situation. When doing so, you should ALSO contact the EEOC or DFEH right away, so that you can get your complaint filed on time (and then request a Right-to-Sue if you still want to go to court).</p>
<p class="text">The process for filing a complaint with the DFEH is almost the same as filing a complaint with the EEOC. For a complete description of how to file a complaint with the DFEH, and what happens after you do, see Appendix P, PG. 703.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153461"></a><a id="EM_FileLawsuit"></a>What if I want to go straight to court and file a lawsuit on my own?</h3>
<p class="text">Under Title VII (and California law also), you cannot go straight to court—you must begin by filing a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH first. This is called “exhausting your administrative remedies.” However, once you file your complaint, you can choose to file a lawsuit against the employer instead of asking the EEOC (or DFEH) to investigate and resolve your complaint.<sup><a href="#footnote-1882" id="footnote-ref-1882">[1882]</a></sup>If you want to file a lawsuit right away, you must ask the EEOC for a Right-to-Sue notice, which is a legal document that allows you to file a lawsuit in court on your own. However, you generally have to give the EEOC 180 days to investigate your complaint first. </p>
<p class="sidebox">For more information about finding a legal aid or employment attorney, or non-profit advocacy organization, see PG. 651. For more information about filing a lawsuit, see PG. 650.</p>
<ol class="text">If it has been more than 180 days (6 months) since you filed your complaint, the EEOC is required to give you a Right-to-Sue notice. If it has been less than 180 days, the EEOC will give you a Right-to-Sue notice only if its own investigation will take longer than 6 months.<sup><a href="#footnote-1883" id="footnote-ref-1883">[1883]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">To request a Right-to-Sue notice, send a written letter to the local EEOC office that is handling your complaint. Once you get the Right-to-Sue notice, you only have 90 days to file your lawsuit in court. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Once you get the Right-to-Sue notice, the EEOC will dismiss your complaint and will not do anything more to investigate or resolve your case. So if you want the EEOC to continue to help with your case, DON’T request a Right-to-Sue notice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1884" id="footnote-ref-1884">[1884]</a></sup>The process for requesting a DFEH Right-to-Sue notice is very similar. For more information on how to request a Right-to-Sue from the DFEH, see <a href="http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/Complaints/Right%20to%20Sue%20form%20(3%20pages).pdf">http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/res/docs/Complaints/Right%20to%20Sue%20form%20(3%20pages).pdf</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153462"></a>Who can represent me if I believe I have been illegally discriminated against for a job because of my record?</h3>
<p class="text">If you believe you have been illegally discriminated against in an employment or hiring decision due to your criminal record (or because of your membership in a protected class like your race, gender, religion, disability, etc.), there may be legal help for you.On PG. 651, read the “Helpful Hint” box to learn about legal aid and employment attorneys; government-run civil rights agencies; and non-profit organizations that may be able to provide you with legal information or representation on your employment discrimination claim.</p>
<h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_FindAttorney"></a>HELPFUL HINT: Find an attorney or government civil rights agency to help you! </h4>
<p class="textbox">If you think an employer has illegally discriminated against you the law, you may want to contact an attorney who can help you decide what to do next. There are 3 types of people who may be able help you:</p>
<h4 class="textbox">1. Legal aid or employment attorney</h4>
<p class="textbox">Legal aid attorneys provide FREE legal assistance to people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer (like a public defender, but for lawsuits and other civil legal cases). Many private employment attorneys only charge fees if you win or settle a case, so you may not have to pay anything out-of-pocket UNLESS you win money from the employer. To find a local legal aid attorney or employment attorney in your area:</p>
<ul class="textbox">Call 211;Contact the local county bar association, or look on the State Bar website at <a href="http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help">http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help</a>; orTo find a list of employment attorneys in your area, visit the California Employment Lawyers Association website at <a href="http://www.cela.org/?page=4">http://www.cela.org/?page=4</a>;For a list of legal aid offices throughout California, see PG. 1180 at the back of this guide.</ul>
<h4 class="textbox">2. Government civil rights agencies </h4>
<p class="textbox">There are 2 government agencies responsible for enforcing your rights against illegal discrimination by employers. Because federal and state law are very similar, you can generally ask either agency to enforce your rights if you think an employer has illegally discriminated against you. For more information about how to report discrimination and file a complaint with the EEOC and DFEH, read the next section, starting on <a id="EM_Discrimination"></a>PG. 651. </p>
<ul class="textbox">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is the federal agency that enforces federal civil rights laws; andThe Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing (DFEH) is the California state agency that enforces your rights under state law.</ul>
<h4 class="textbox">3. Non-profit organizations</h4>
<p class="textbox">You can also contact a non-profit organization that helps people who have been discriminated against by employers based on their criminal record:</p>
<ul class="textbox">National Employment Law Project (NELP)—(510) 409-2427<a href="http://www.nelp.org/index.php/content/content_issues/category/criminal_records_and_employment/">http://www.nelp.org/index.php/content/content_issues/category/criminal_records_and_employment/</a>Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights (LCCR—San Francisco)—(415) 814-7610 <a href="http://www.lccr.com/programs/racial-justice/direct-services/second-chance-legal-clinic/">http://www.lccr.com/programs/racial-justice/direct-services/second-chance-legal-clinic/</a>Or other local organizations or clinics in your area—see PG. 1180 for more information on reentry legal aid services available in your area.</ul>

<h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
<ul class="learn-bullets">What types of jobs you may be disqualified from getting, based on your criminal recordWhen and how you may become eligible for these jobs in the future</ul>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="EM_LegalRestrictionsCertainJobs"></a><a id="_Toc448153464"></a>Legal restrictions on certain jobs</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153465"></a>Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record? </h3>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, yes… But this is very rare. Although we don't want to give you bad news, we also want to give you the information you need to decide which jobs will be best for you! There are a few situations when having a criminal record—or having certain types of convictions on your record—will disqualify you from getting certain types of jobs. It is important that you know about these situations beforehand, so that you can realistically set your sights on jobs that you can have. Although this list is incomplete, below are some examples of jobs that have legal restrictions for people with certain criminal convictions. In general, these are jobs where you would have access to private or sensitive information (like financial records); vulnerable people (like children or the elderly), or high-security places, where there might be a greater risk of harm to the public.</p>
<ol class="text">Airport security screeners (or anyone with unsupervised access to secure airport areas);<sup><a href="#footnote-1885" id="footnote-ref-1885">[1885]</a></sup> Federal law enforcement officers;<sup><a href="#footnote-1886" id="footnote-ref-1886">[1886]</a></sup>Defense contractors;<sup><a href="#footnote-1887" id="footnote-ref-1887">[1887]</a></sup>Prisoner transportation personnel;<sup><a href="#footnote-1888" id="footnote-ref-1888">[1888]</a></sup>Port workers;<sup><a href="#footnote-1889" id="footnote-ref-1889">[1889]</a></sup>Bank employees;<sup><a href="#footnote-1890" id="footnote-ref-1890">[1890]</a></sup>Insurance personnel;<sup><a href="#footnote-1891" id="footnote-ref-1891">[1891]</a></sup>Jobs that administer employee benefits plan;<sup><a href="#footnote-1892" id="footnote-ref-1892">[1892]</a></sup>Childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies;<sup><a href="#footnote-1893" id="footnote-ref-1893">[1893]</a></sup>Working for a school district in a position that requires certification or a supervisory capacity (if you have been convicted of a felony defined as serious or violent under law);<sup><a href="#footnote-1894" id="footnote-ref-1894">[1894]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Most of the time, if an employer cannot hire a person with a record for certain types of job positions, the employer may still be able to hire that person for other positions. If an employer says that they cannot hire you for a job based on your criminal record, you should ask whether there are any other positions available that you could take instead.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153466"></a>Can I ever be eligible again to get these jobs?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends. Each of these jobs has very specific rules about what convictions will disqualify you, and whether and how you can become eligible for them again. It will depend on the specific laws, regulations, and other rules that apply to that type of work.<sup><a href="#footnote-1895" id="footnote-ref-1895">[1895]</a></sup> It is recommended that you ask a lawyer to review your RAP sheet and explain how your convictions will affect your ability to get the job you want. See PG. 651 for how to contact an attorney. </p>
<ol class="text">For some jobs, you are only disqualified for a certain period of time, and then you will become eligible after that time has passed.For many jobs, you can become eligible if your conviction is expunged, or if you get a Certificate of Rehabilitation or a pardon for the conviction.For some jobs, you can request a waiver or exemption for your conviction, which means asking the government to make an exception to the law based on your individual circumstances. You may need to present evidence of rehabilitation and other factors showing that your conviction does not pose a risk of harm and therefore you should not be disqualified because of it.If you think you were disqualified based on incorrect information in your record, you may be able to appeal the disqualification and show that you should NOT be disqualified according to the law. For example, if you were not actually convicted of the offense that caused you to be disqualified for the job (e.g., the charges were dismissed, or you pleaded guilty to a lesser offense that does NOT disqualify you), you can appeal and present court records showing that you were not convicted of that offense.</ol>

<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT for occupational licenses:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you are thinking of applying for a professional/occupational license, you should talk to an attorney or reentry program counselor for advice and assistance.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153468"></a>What are professional and occupational licenses and what do they require?</h3>
<p class="text">In California, people who work in certain jobs are required to get a <strong><em>license</em></strong> from the state to do so. There are over 200 professions in California that require a professional or occupational license—ranging from barbers and cosmetologists, to security guards, contractors, teachers, nurses, doctors and lawyers. Professional and occupational licenses are granted and regulated by different <strong><em>licensing boards, agencies, and bureaus</em></strong> (over 40 in total, each for a different industry), all under the control of the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).<sup><a href="#footnote-1896" id="footnote-ref-1896">[1896]</a></sup>Applying for a professional or occupational license generally requires submitting fingerprints, paying application fees, and proving that you meet certain educational and/or work experience requirements, which are set by the particular licensing board to which you’re applying.<sup><a href="#footnote-1897" id="footnote-ref-1897">[1897]</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153469"></a>What kinds of jobs require a professional or occupational license?</h3>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153470"></a>Can I get a professional or occupational license with a record?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on what type of license you are trying to get, what conviction(s) you have on your record, and what rehabilitation efforts you have participated in. Some professional/occupational licenses have extremely strict rules about criminal records, while other types of licenses are more lenient. It is best to check with the licensing board for the profession you want to enter to find out its current criteria. </p>
<h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint</h4>
<p class="textbox">Professional and occupational licenses are often denied due to past convictions, but don’t be discouraged! You can appeal a denial and advocate for yourself on appeal. There are also legal aid and reentry attorneys who may be able to help you appeal!</p>
<a id="_Toc448153471"></a>
<h3>What criminal history information can a licensing board consider about me? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
<p class="sidebox"><em>Submit a Pre-Approval Application When Possible</em>The Board of Barbering &amp; Cosmetology has a special early application process for people with criminal convictions who want to apply for a license. You can submit an initial application and find out ahead of time whether you will be able to get a license, before you go through any training or pay any fees.<span class="emphasisitalic">Note</span>: You will still have to complete all of the training and examination requirements, in order to get your actual license.</p>
<p class="text">When you apply for a professional license, the licensing board can see your entire record—including convictions that have been “expunged.” (Note: Regular employers generally CANNOT see expunged convictions—but licensing boards are different.) However, the board cannot deny your licenses based ONLY on the fact that you have a conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1898" id="footnote-ref-1898">[1898]</a></sup>Beyond criminal history information, licensing boards MUST also consider <em>mitigating and rehabilitative evidence</em>. <em>Mitigating evidence</em> is information that would make the board judge a conviction less harshly, and could be information like youth, drug addiction, duress, or other factors that were going on at the time of the offense. <em>Rehabiliative evidence</em> is proof of your efforts to change and improve yourself, demonstrating that you are no longer at risk of the conduct or circumstances that led to your past system involvement. You can submit this evidence at the time of your application, and on appeal.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153472"></a>Can a licensing board deny me a license based on my record?</h3>
<p class="text">The licensing board can deny your application for a license based on a criminal conviction, but ONLY if your conviction is <strong>“substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the business or profession.”</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1899" id="footnote-ref-1899">[1899]</a></sup> This legal standard means that the type of conduct you were convicted for—for example, theft, selling drugs, violence, or fraud—creates a high risk of harm, or otherwise prevents you from safely completing the specific tasks and responsibilities of the job that you want a license for. For example, a conviction for drug distribution might be considered “substantially related” to a pharmacist license, since pharmacists have access to lots of drugs and are responsibility for safely providing drugs to other people.<sup><a href="#footnote-1900" id="footnote-ref-1900">[1900]</a></sup><strong><em>PLEASE NOTE:</em></strong><em> </em>Some crimes, such as those involving physical violence or fraud, dishonesty and deceit, are <em>presumed</em> to be “substantially related” to any profession regulated by the California Business &amp; Profession Code (including medical, law, construction, and real estate licenses).<sup><a href="#footnote-1901" id="footnote-ref-1901">[1901]</a></sup>In addition to actual convictions, a licensing board is also allowed to consider <strong>“any act involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit” that you have done “with the intent to substantially benefit” yourself or someone else, or “substantially injure another.” </strong>However, as with convictions, the act must also be “substantially related” to the qualifications, functions, or duties of the job.<sup><a href="#footnote-1902" id="footnote-ref-1902">[1902]</a></sup> </p>
<h3 class="subheading3">Mitigating &amp; Rehabilitative Evidence for Licensing Boards:</h3>
<p class="text">Even if the licensing board determines that your conviction is “substantially related” to the qualifications of your chosen profession, California law <em>requires</em> that the board also consider any <strong>evidence of rehabilitation or other positive factors</strong> that you present. Each licensing board <strong>must</strong> create its own criteria to evaluate your rehabilitation efforts.<sup><a href="#footnote-1903" id="footnote-ref-1903">[1903]</a></sup> <strong>Although each board is different, most focus on the following rehabilitative factors:<sup><a href="#footnote-1904" id="footnote-ref-1904">[1904]</a></sup> </strong>The amount of time that has passed since your conviction; whether you successfully completed parole or probation; whether you have shown remorse; your change in attitude; alcohol or drug counseling;your pursuit of education or vocational training;the stability of your family life; and your community involvement.<strong>In addition:</strong></p>
<ol class="text">If the state of California has given you a <strong>Certificate of Rehabilitation</strong> (see more on PG. 1078), then a licensing board CANNOT deny you a professional license based solely on your conviction.For professions governed by the California Business &amp; Professions Code, a licensing board also CANNOT deny you for (1) having a misdemeanor if you have met all of the board’s rehabilitative critera, or (2) for a felony that has been dismissed (“expunged”).<sup><a href="#footnote-1905" id="footnote-ref-1905">[1905]</a></sup> (Many of the individual board’s rehabilitative criteria can be found in the California Code of Regulations.)</ol>
<h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSIf you prepared for your license while incarcerated…</h4>
<p class="textbox">Many people are able to learn new job skills or complete professional license requirements while incarcerated. In the past, licensing boards were allowed to delay or deny your license application just because you had completed the licensing requirements while incarcerated. But now, a new California law makes it <strong>illegal</strong> for a licensing board to delay or deny your license based solely on the fact that you completed some or all of the licensure requirements while incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-1906" id="footnote-ref-1906">[1906]</a></sup> If you otherwise qualify for the license, it no longer matters that you were incarcerated when you prepared for it.<span class="emphasisheavy">IMPORTANT:</span> The new law does NOT change any other rules about whether you can get a license. A licensing board CAN still deny you a license based on your conviction, if they determine that the conviction is “substantially related” to the qualifications and duties of the job. Also, the law does NOT change any rules about <em>when</em> you can apply and whether you can apply while you’re still incarcerated. </p>
<a id="_Toc448153473"></a>
<h3>Can I apply for a license while I’m still incarcerated?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">Special program for getting your cosmetology license while incarcerated</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you are incarcerated at Valley State Prison, California Women’s Institute, or Central California Women’s Facility (Chowchilla), there is a special program that can help you to get your cosmetology license while you’re incarcerated. You can complete your training school AND take the licensing examination in these facilities—meaning it is possible to already have your license in hand by the time you’re released.IMPORTANT: This program does NOT stop the licensing board from considering your criminal conviction, and does NOT change any of the other qualifications to get your license. In other words, the licensing board can still deny you a license if the board decides that your conviction is substantially related to the duties and responsibilities of a cosmetologist. </p>
<p class="text">It depends.<strong> </strong>Each licensing board has different rules and requirements. Some may require you to wait a certain amount of time after your conviction or release before you can be eligible.<sup><a href="#footnote-1907" id="footnote-ref-1907">[1907]</a></sup> In addition, most boards will consider the amount of time that has passed since your conviction, and may give more weight to time after you were released or once you were off supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-1908" id="footnote-ref-1908">[1908]</a></sup>For this reason, even if you’re not specifically required to wait, you still may be more successful if you wait to apply until after you’re released.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153474"></a>Can I apply for a probationary license before I get a full license?</h3>
<p class="text">Possibly—it depends on which licensing board you apply to. Some boards are allowed to issue “probationary licenses”—which are licenses with certain restrictions or conditions—to people with criminal records who might not be approved for a full license.<sup><a href="#footnote-1909" id="footnote-ref-1909">[1909]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153475"></a>What can I do if the board denies my application for a license? </h3>
<p class="text"><strong>You can appeal your denial! </strong>Don't be discouraged if your application is denied; many applications are denied because of past convictions , but are successful on appeal. There are also some legal aid attorneys and clinics that may be able to help you appeal (see the Legal Aid Providers on PG. 1180).Generally, you have the right to appeal the board’s denial and have an administrative hearing before a <em>neutral administrative law judge</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1910" id="footnote-ref-1910">[1910]</a></sup> At the hearing, you have the right to present evidence of your rehabilitation and argue your case for why you deserve a license.<sup><a href="#footnote-1911" id="footnote-ref-1911">[1911]</a></sup> For a general overview of what the appeals process is like, see Appendix Q, PG. 705.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153476"></a>What can I do if I used to have a license, but lost it due to a criminal conviction? </h3>
<p class="text">If you previously had a professional license, your license may have been revoked (permanently taken away) or suspended (temporarily taken away) because of your criminal conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1912" id="footnote-ref-1912">[1912]</a></sup> In this case, you generally have the right to ask the licensing board to reinstate (re-issue) your license to you, or to reduce your penalty and return your license sooner.<sup><a href="#footnote-1913" id="footnote-ref-1913">[1913]</a></sup> To do this, you must first wait at least 1 year from the date your license was taken away, and then submit special forms (a petition) and other documents to the licensing board.<sup><a href="#footnote-1914" id="footnote-ref-1914">[1914]</a></sup> Each licensing board may also have different or additional requirements, such as completing your term of probation or parole first, before you can ask for your license to be returned.<sup><a href="#footnote-1915" id="footnote-ref-1915">[1915]</a></sup> (Note: Although you can apply to have your license reinstated while you are still incarcerated, you are unlikely to be successful if you apply while you’re still inside.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1916" id="footnote-ref-1916">[1916]</a></sup>The licensing board will give you a chance to present your reasons for why your license should be returned or reissued. This may be during a hearing, or by sending in a written statement. The Attorney General will also have a chance to argue for why your license should not be returned.<sup><a href="#footnote-1917" id="footnote-ref-1917">[1917]</a></sup> In order to get your license back, you will generally need to prove that you have been rehabilitated since your offense<sup><a href="#footnote-1918" id="footnote-ref-1918">[1918]</a></sup>—particularly since you were released from prison or jail.<sup><a href="#footnote-1919" id="footnote-ref-1919">[1919]</a></sup> This means showing that you have changed your life for the better, taken steps to improve yourself and correct previous bad habits, and successfully completed the requirements of your sentence. The board may also consider the nature and severity of the offense, how much time has passed since the conviction, whether the conviction has been dismissed, any other convictions on your record, and letters of recommendation or good character from people who know you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1920" id="footnote-ref-1920">[1920]</a></sup> </p>

<h2>ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT</h2>
<h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
<ul class="learn-bullets">Other ways of working and earning an income that are different from traditional employment, including:Self-employment or starting your own businessWhat an independent contractor is and how to become oneJoining a worker-run cooperative businessApplying through a temp agencyTaking short-term or temporary positions to get your foot in the doorWhere to look for more information about each of these options</ul>
<p class="text">Throughout your job search, keep in mind that traditional employment is NOT your only option. There are many other ways of working and earning legitimate income—like starting your own business, joining a worker-run cooperative business, or going through a temp agency—and you may decide that one of these is better for you. This section will explain some of the alternatives to traditional employment that you may want to consider:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">Talk to a trusted person, or someone from a local reentry or workforce development program, for other ideas about alternative work opportunities that may be available.</p>
<ol class="text">Self-employment Starting your own businessBecoming an independent contractorJoining a worker-run cooperative Applying through a temp agencyTaking short-term jobs or temporary positions to get your foot in the door</ol>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153480"></a>Consider self-employment or start your own business </h1>
<p class="text">Some people find it more fulfilling and empowering to be their own boss. Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, freedom and flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibility within the workplace. It also gives you more legal and business responsibilities, such as managing money and product, paying taxes, marketing your business and supervising employees.There are many resources available for people who want to start a business—good places to start are your local library, the Internet, or classes at a local community college or adult school. Also, many non-profit organizations and government agencies now offer assistance to people who want to start their own business. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, you’ll find a list of organizations and other resources for starting your own business in Appendix R, PG. 707.</p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153481"></a>Become an independent contractor</h1>
<p class="text">Being an independent contractor is a form of self-employment somewhere between being an employee and running your own business. Employers usually hire independent contractors to do specific tasks or short-term jobs—like painting a house, installing plumbing, or doing landscaping work. The job usually ends automatically once the task is finished, although the employer can always hire the independent contractor again for another task. The BIG difference between independent contractors and employees is that, under the law, independent contractors are considered to be self-employed. This means that independent contractors have more control over the work they choose to do. They also have legal responsibilities—like filing self-employment taxes and reporting certain business information to the government—and fewer legal rights in the workplace. On the other hand, employees have more legal rights and protections in the workplace, but the employer gets to control the work they do.</p>
<p class="importantbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: <em>Am I an independent contractor or employees? </em>In some cases, an employer may call you an independent contractor, even though you are ACTUALLY an employee. The difference between an employee and an independent contractor is important, because you have more rights (and the employer has more responsibilities) if you are an employee; and you have fewer rights (and the employer has fewer responsibilities) if you are an independent contractor.Sometimes an employer will get this wrong by accident, but other times an employer may misclassify you on purpose in order to avoid fulfilling their duties under law. According to the law, whether you are an employee or an independent contractor depends on the specific details of your work situation—NOT on what the employer calls you. For this reason, it’s important that you know the difference so that you don’t get taken advantage of! For more information on the difference between independent contractors and employees, and your rights and responsibilities in each situation, see the Appendix S, PG. 709.</p>
<h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSWhat can I do if I think an employer has wrongly classified me as an independent contractor OR violated my rights as an employee?</h4>
<p class="textbox">The California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) is the state agency responsible for enforcing your rights in the workplace. If you think an employer has violated your rights as an employee, wrongly classified you as an independent contractor, and/or for more information, you can contact your local DLSE office and speak with Deputy Labor Commissioner. To find a local DLSE office near you, go to <a href="http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DistrictOffices.htm">http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DistrictOffices.htm</a> or call 1-844-LABOR-DIR (1-844-522-6734) for assistance.For more information about your rights in the workplace, contact The Legal Aid Society—Employment Law Center’s Workers Rights Clinic at 415-864-8208 (San Francisco Bay Area) or 866-864-8208 (toll free in CA).

<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153482"></a>Join a worker-run cooperative business</h1>
<p class="text">A worker cooperative is a business that is owned and controlled by its workers. In other words, the workers are both the employees AND the employer. Usually, workers run the day-to-day operations of the business—such as making business decisions, assigning tasks to each person, etc., as well as the business’s finances. Although each person has a different level of responsibility, all workers are considered to be equal members and have equal power within the business.Any business can be a worker-owned and controlled cooperative. Worker co-ops have been successful in many different industries. Some examples are:</p>
<ol class="text">Service—housecleaning, day labor, restaurants, taxis, childcareFarming and food production—urban or community farms, community-supported agriculture programs, bakeries, restaurantsRetail—grocery stores, bookstores, bike shopsHealth care—nursing, home health care, clinics, bodyworkSkilled trades—printing, plumbing, woodworking, contractingManufacturing and engineering—machine parts, fabricatingTechnology—web hosting, networking, voice and data systemsEducation—charter schools, teacher/student/parent-run schoolsMedia and the arts—designers, galleries, performers, publishers</ol>

<h1 class="subheading">Apply to work through a temp agency</h1>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">Talk to someone from a local reentry or workforce development program for advice about finding a good temp agency and what to expect. </p>
<p class="text">Temp agencies (also called staffing agencies) help match people who are looking for work with employers who want to hire them. Temp agencies can often help you to find a short-term job or part-time job quickly, which, in some cases, can get your foot in the door for a permanent position in the future. In addition, some temp agencies specifically focus on helping people with criminal records get jobs, and they work with employers who are open to hiring applicants with criminal records. Another benefit of going through to a temp agency is that once you apply to the agency, they can place you in jobs with many different employers who want to hire. Applying to a temp agency is similar to applying for a job directly with the employer—it will likely include an interview, checking your references, and possibly even doing a background check. The temp agency may also have you take an assessment test to evaluate your work strengths and skills. It still can be easier to apply through a temp agency rather than an employer, because most agencies always want to increase their pool of employees to choose from, and employers often prefer to hire temp workers because it’s cheaper.If you’re interested in applying to a temp agency, here are some things to keep in mind: </p>
<ol class="text">Not all temp agencies are the same! Just like employers, some temp agencies are better to work for than others. Ask around to find a temp agency that treats employees well and has a good record of placing people in jobs. Some things to ask about are: how long people usually have to wait before getting placed with an employer; how long most jobs last; what employers the temp agency works with; whether the agency places many people with criminal records; and how the agency treats people.Different temp agencies may focus on different types of jobs or different industries. Each temp agency is different, so the application requirements and process may be different from one agency to another. If there are several different temp agencies available in your area, do your homework to find out which one is right for you. When you apply through a temp agency, you will have to sign a contract with the agency that makes you an employee. Any offers of work that you get, either temporary or permanent, must go through the agency. The contract may even prohibit you from looking for work on the side, outside of the agency. If you want to look for other work on your own, you may need to ask the agency to release you from your contract. Before you sign up with a temp agency, it is recommended that you read all the fine print and ask questions about anything you don’t fully understand!The temp agency is responsible for paying the employees who they send to work for an employer. The employer will pay the temp agency—NOT the employee—for the work, and then the agency takes a cut of the money and gives the rest to the employee. For example, if the employer pays the temp agency $20/hour for each employee, the agency may keep $5/hour of pay and then pay the employee $15/hour.Beware of any temp agency that charges you a fee for job placement! Most agencies collect their fees from the employer—NOT from the job applicant or employee.</ol>

<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153484"></a>Take short-term jobs or temporary positions to get your foot in the door</h1>
<p class="text">If an employer seems uncertain about hiring you, ask if they would give you the opportunity to prove yourself by starting work in a short-term, part-time, or temporary position, or for a test period. This gives you a chance to show the employer that you are a hard worker, and that you can work safely and responsibly. It can also help get your foot in the door for a long-term job afterward. If you do well during the testing period, you can ask the employer to consider hiring you for a permanent or full-time job, or at least to keep you in mind if a permanent job opens up in the future.If you’re participating in a workforce development program or have enrolled at an America’s Job Center, you can also ask whether they have any special programs that let you get paid for doing on-the-job training or getting work experience with an employer. These programs are great because they help you to develop your job skills, get training, and practice working for an employer—and get paid at the same time! In addition, these programs can sometimes turn into longer-term employment afterward, because an employer may be more willing to hire you once you prove yourself in training.<sup><a href="#footnote-1921" id="footnote-ref-1921">[1921]</a></sup> </p>

<h3>What is a disability under law? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">What is a MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITY</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Under<s> </s>California law, “major life activity” means those activities that are of central importance to daily life. Under California law, major life activities include any physical, mental, and social activities, and working. Examples of these activities include taking care of yourself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, walking, learning, and working.</p>
<p class="text">California law defines a disability as any physical or mental impairment that limits one or more of your major life activities (such as walking, talking, working, or taking care of yourself).<sup><a href="#footnote-1922" id="footnote-ref-1922">[1922]</a></sup> </p>
<h5 class="question">What counts as a physical disability in California?</h5>
<p class="answer">A physical impairment is any disease, physical disorder, physical condition, or disfigurement that:</p>
<ol class="text">Affects one or more of your body systems (i.e. your heart, your eyes) or functions (i.e. breathing, speaking); AND Limits a major life activity.<sup><a href="#footnote-1923" id="footnote-ref-1923">[1923]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="normal1"><strong>What counts as a mental impairment?</strong> </p>
<p class="answer">A mental impairment is any mental or psychological condition that limits a major life activity. Examples of mental impairments are:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">Examples of physical disabilities:</h4>
<ul class="sidebox">Deafness, blindness, missing limbs (leg, arm, finger, foot, etc.), using a wheelchair, and any bodily condition that limits your ability to see, hear, walk, talk, move around, work, or take care of yourself.Diseases like HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or other medical conditions that limit your ability to see, hear, walk, talk, move around, work, or take care of yourself.</ul>
<ol class="text">Intellectual disabilities Brain disease Emotional or mental illnesses (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or clinical depression)Learning disabilitiesAny other mental or psychological condition that requires special attention or services (such as autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, or PTSD).<sup><a href="#footnote-1924" id="footnote-ref-1924">[1924]</a></sup> </ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Disabilities based on substance abuse Under state and federal law, the following conditions are considered disabilities that are protected against discrimination: </p>
<ul class="importantbox">PAST drug addiction (NOT current drug use)<sup><a href="#footnote-1925" id="footnote-ref-1925">[1925]</a></sup>Alcoholism (past or present)<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1926" id="footnote-ref-1926">[1926]</a></sup></strong>If you were or currently are affected by either of these conditions, you are protected against discrimination based on your condition, and employers are required to make “reasonable accommodations” for your condition.BUT it will NOT count as a protected disability IF:You are currently using illegal drugs; ORYou use drugs or alcohol at work in violation of the employer’s rules or policies.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1927" id="footnote-ref-1927">[1927]</a></sup></strong></ul>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153488"></a>If I have a disability, how might this affect my job search?</h3>
<p class="text">State and federal laws provide special protections for job applicants and employees with disabilities. These laws require employers to make “reasonable accommodations” that allow someone with a disability to apply for and work in a job just like anyone else.Remember, physical disabilities are not the only disabilities that are recognized. The following conditions are also considered disabilities—meaning employers are required to make “reasonable accommodations” for you if you have any of these:</p>
<ol class="text">PAST drug addiction (NOT current drug use)<sup><a href="#footnote-1928" id="footnote-ref-1928">[1928]</a></sup>Alcoholism (past or present)<sup><a href="#footnote-1929" id="footnote-ref-1929">[1929]</a></sup>Mental illness</ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT:<span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>To be protected by state and federal disability laws, you must also be qualified for the job you seek.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153489"></a>What do I need to know about the relationship between my disabilities and my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">If you can show that your disability caused your conviction, you may be able to ask an employer to make “reasonable accommodations” for your situation—for example, by making an exception to a policy against hiring people with your type of conviction, or by considering your criminal record under an easier standard. At least 2 federal courts have agreed that employers can be required to provide reasonably accommodations for employees whose workplace violations were caused by prior substance abuse, after the employees had later completed rehab programs. See more examples of reasonable accommodations during the job search, and when you apply, on PG. 667.If you have suffered from one of the conditions listed above, it is possible that your criminal conviction(s) may have been the result of your disability—in other words, you committed the offense because of your mental illness or past drug or alcohol addiction. </p>
<a id="EM_ReasonableAccommodations_Example"></a>
<a id="_Toc448153490"></a>
<h3>What kinds of accommodations can I request?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">You can also have someone else talk to the employer for you, to ask for the accommodation you need. In this case, you may want to ask your case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or another trusted person who is helping you with your job search, to speak with the employer on your behalf.</p>
<p class="text">You can request any accommodation that is reasonable and necessary so that you can be considered for the job like any other applicant or perform the job like any other employee. Each situation is different, so the type of accommodation you request will depend on your particular circumstances and the type of work or employer involved. These are just a few examples of accommodations you may request:</p>
<ol class="text">Making an exception to a hiring or employment policy that restricts applicants/employees with certain types of convictions;Disregarding a conviction caused by your disability;Considering your conviction under an easier standard;Giving you an opportunity to explain your conviction and provide additional (medical) evidence of your disability and rehabilitation;Giving you time off to attend treatment programs;Disregarding workplace violations caused by your disability.</ol>
<p class="text">The employer is not necessarily required to provide the exact accommodation that you ask for—but MUST provide an accommodation that has the same effect.<sup><a href="#footnote-1930" id="footnote-ref-1930">[1930]</a></sup> For example, the employer might be allowed to rearrange your work schedule—rather than give you time off—so that you can attend treatment programs.</p>
<p class="importantbox">EXCEPTIONS: There are 3 situations where an employer is NOT required to provide a reasonable accommodation for your disability: 1) where the accommodation will cause the employer “Undue Hardship,” 2) where the reasonable accommodation would present a “Direct Threat” to the safety of others or property, or 3) where the employer shows that you CANNOT safely perform essential job functions. For more information about these exceptions, see Appendix U, PG. 713</p>
<p class="text">After you request a reasonable accommodation, the employer has to genuinely consider your request, and talk to you about what types of accommodations could help your situation. The employer can also ask you for more information about your disability to help with the decision. An employer CANNOT simply ignore your request OR wait an unreasonable amount of time to respond, hoping that you give up.<sup><a href="#footnote-1931" id="footnote-ref-1931">[1931]</a></sup>If an employer decides NOT to hire you based on you disability, the employer MUST give you a chance to get a medical opinion about your condition from an independent doctor. If the employer refuses to let you get an independent opinion, it may be violating the law.<sup><a href="#footnote-1932" id="footnote-ref-1932">[1932]</a></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153491"></a>What will I need to show to get a reasonable accommodation?</h3>
<p class="text">To get a reasonable accommodation for your conviction, you must show two things:</p>
<ol class="text">Your conviction was caused by your disability. This meansExplaining to the employer that you have a disability and what the disability is; ANDProviding any documents you have regarding your disability and treatment, including:Letters from doctors or service providers (a) saying that you experienced drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, and/or some other disability at the time of the offense, and (b) describing how your disability affected you;Letters from doctors or service providers showing that you successful completed a rehabilitation program or are participating in effective ongoing treatment of your mental illness or other disability;Letters from doctors or service providers that show you are no longer using substances and/or you are receiving appropriate treatment to control the symptoms of your mental illness or other disability.</ol>
<p class="textbox">REMEMBER: It may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was caused by your drug or alcohol addiction, mental illness, or other disability. It is important that you submit as much evidence as possible! It’s best if you can have a doctor submit a letter confirming that you have a disability and how it affects you.</p>
<ol class="text">The accommodation that you’re asking for is “reasonable” and “necessary.” This means showing that—The change is necessary for you to apply for or work at the job on an equal basis with other applicants or employees—for example, if the employer does not make an accommodation, your application would be rejected due to your conviction history;It’s not too expensive or burdensome for the employer to make the change;It doesn’t fundamentally change the employer’s business operations;There is a relationship between your disability and the change you are requesting—in other words, you are only asking for an exception for the specific convictions that were caused by your disability, NOT other, unrelated convictions that you might have.<sup> </sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1933" id="footnote-ref-1933">[1933]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">For more information about requesting a reasonable accommodation, see Appendix U, PG. 713. To see a sample letter requesting a reasonable accommodation, see Appendix V, PG. 714.</p>
<a id="EM_ChallengeReasonableAccomDenial"></a>
<a id="_Toc448153492"></a>
<h3>What can I do if the employer refuses to make a reasonable accommodation for me? How can I challenge the decision? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Should I also talk to a lawyer?You may also want to talk to a legal aid or employment attorney, or non-profit organization to get advice about your situation. However, you will still have to file a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH first, before you are allowed to file a lawsuit in court against the employer. For this reason, it’s important that you contact the EEOC or DFEH immediately, and then you can also talk to an attorney.</p>
<p class="textbox">BUT REMEMBER: Just because you committed a criminal offense when you were suffering from a mental illness or a past drug addiction does not mean you automatically have the right to a reasonable accommodation on your job application today. It can be very difficult to prove that your disability caused your criminal offense, AND that the disability is the type that qualifies you for a reasonable accommodation. Although these reasonable accommodation requests can be difficult, it can be worth asking for them!Remember, just like with other discrimination complaints, you only have 300 days to file a complaint with the EEOC, or 1 year to file a complaint with the DFEH! For more information about finding a legal aid or employment attorney or non-profit organization, see PG. 651 above. For more information about filing a lawsuit, see PG. 669 below.</p>
<p class="text">If you believe that an employer denied your request for a reasonable accommodation due to your disability and/or your past drug use, you can file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (federal employment protection agency) or with California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (the state employment protection agency).<sup><a href="#footnote-1934" id="footnote-ref-1934">[1934]</a></sup> The complaint process is the SAME for disability discrimination (an employer’s refusal to provide reasonable accommodations) as for other types of illegal discrimination based on your criminal record (e.g., discrimination based on your race, religion, sex, national origin, etc.). See PG. 646 for more information on filing a discrimination complaint with the EEOC or the DFEH and what to expect. Even if you want to want to file a lawsuit against the employer, you will still have to file a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH first. (This is just like suing an employer for discrimination based on your criminal record—see PG. 650 above for more information.) </p>
<h3><a id="EM_Sue_ReasonableAccomodations"></a><a id="_Toc448153493"></a>If I try to sue the employer in court, what must I prove?</h3>
<p class="text">To sue an employer under the federal ADA (FHA), California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act),<sup><a href="#footnote-1935" id="footnote-ref-1935">[1935]</a></sup> you must show that your status as an individual with a disability was a motivating factor in the employer’s decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.<sup><a href="#footnote-1936" id="footnote-ref-1936">[1936]</a></sup> You must also provide evidence that your disability substantially limited your ability to live a normal life,<sup><a href="#footnote-1937" id="footnote-ref-1937">[1937]</a></sup> that the requested accommodation is reasonable and necessary, and (for a disability related to substance abuse) that you are not currently using illegal drugs.<sup> </sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1938" id="footnote-ref-1938">[1938]</a></sup>Remember, you CANNOT sue an employer in court until AFTER you’ve filed a complaint with the EEOC or DFEH and received a Right-to-Sue notice.NOTE: You should be prepared for the employer to argue that you do NOT have a protected disability because you are a “current user” of illegal drugs, or that you are not being treated for your mental illness.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1939" id="footnote-ref-1939">[1939]</a></sup></sup> You can support your request by providing treatment records showing that you have not used drugs for a significant period of time, or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1940" id="footnote-ref-1940">[1940]</a></sup></sup> You should also provide evidence of your participation in or completion of a drug abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness.</p>

<h4>EXPUNGEMENTS, PARDONS, AND CERTIFICATES OF REHABILITATION*</h4>
<p class="text">If you have had your conviction expunged or pardoned, or you received a Certificate of Rehabilitation, give the employer a copy! Give them to the employer along with your completed job application or during your interview. (Important: Make sure you only give the employer a photocopy and keep the original documents for yourself.)</p>
<h4>OTHER REHABILITATION DOCUMENTS</h4>
<p class="text">These include any certificates, diplomas, letters of recommendation, or other documents that show your accomplishments since your conviction, and that you have turned your life around for the better. Here are just some examples of things you can bring:</p>
<ol class="text">Certificates or diplomas for any programs that you completed while inside or after your release—e.g., vocational training and job skills, anger management, substance abuse, GED classes, etc.;Letters of support from people who know you and can speak to your good character or work ethic—e.g., a former employer, pastor at your church, case manager or social worker, volunteer coordinator, or personal friend. Certificates from any professional training or school courses you’ve completed;Proof of other jobs or volunteer work that you’ve done since your conviction; and/orDischarge papers from a rehabilitation facility.For more suggestions about how to get evidence of rehabilitation, this guide can help you: <em>How to Gather Evidence of Rehabilitation</em> (Legal Action Center), available online at: <a href="http://lac.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How_to_Gather_Evidence_of_Rehabilitation_2013.pdf">http://lac.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How_to_Gather_Evidence_of_<br/>Rehabilitation_2013.pdf</a></ol>

<p class="text">These tips can help you succeed in job interviews, especially if you have to answer any difficult questions about your criminal record. Here are some suggested steps and tips:</p>
<h4 class="step">Thoughtfully answer each interview question.</h4>
<p class="text">Here are some tips for addressing your criminal record and answering other tough questions during a job interview:</p>
<ol class="text">Own it! Take responsibility for your actions. State the facts, but express regret for what happened. Don’t get defensive. Don’t go into details. Keep your answers short. Be honest, but only talk about necessary information based on the questions you are asked.Tell the employer how you have changed. Emphasize that the incident happened long ago and that you are a different person now. Explain what you learned while you were in prison/jail, and what you are doing differently now. Highlight any services that you’re getting to help you move on. Paint a picture of the person you are now. Emphasize your qualifications. Describe the things that will make you a good employee—such as previous work experience, job training programs, or classes that you’ve taken. Show the employer why you are qualified for the position and will be a benefit to the company.Describe your hopes and dreams. Show the employer than you are in control of your life and have short-term and long-term goals. Highlight any programs or services that you’re participating in to help you move on and achieve your goals. Emphasize that you would be very appreciative of the opportunity to work for them, and you will be the hardest worker they will ever have.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1941" id="footnote-ref-1941">[1941]</a></sup></sup> DON’T LIE! If the employer finds out the truth (though a background check, or later on after you’ve been hired), they can reject or fire you for lying—regardless of your record and qualifications for the job!</ol>
<p class="text">The most important question of all is “Why Should I Hire You?” Remember, the most important thing to show is that you are qualified for the position and that you will benefit the employer’s company if they hire you. You should also be ready to explain why you are interested in the job. Be sure you have all of these answers prepared and practice them beforehand. IMPORTANT: What if the employer asks an illegal question or asks about something that should not have been included in your background check? See PG. 615 for more information about what you can do in this situation.</p>
<h4 class="step">Ask your own questions.</h4>
<p class="text">Often, employers will give you a chance to ask them questions at the end of an interview, so it’s best to have several questions prepared beforehand. Here are some sample questions you can ask that demonstrate your interest in the position and the company—the answers will make you look better!</p>
<ol class="text">What is most important for you (my boss) to be happy with me if I get this job?What would you like me to accomplish in the first couple of weeks on the job?Why did the person who had this job before leave?<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1942" id="footnote-ref-1942">[1942]</a></sup></sup> Any other questions showing that you’ve done your homework to research and learn about the company.DON’T just ask about wages, hours, or benefits!</ol>
<h4 class="step">Practice beforehand!</h4>
<p class="text">If possible, you should try to do a practice (“mock”) interview before the real thing with your case manager, social worker, counselor, or family or friends. Have the other person pretend they’re the employer and ask you interview questions, so that you can practice giving your answers. Remember, even if you have your answers prepared on paper or in your head, things will sound different when you try to say them out loud!</p>
<h4 class="step">Be polite and confident during the interview.</h4>
<p class="text">Here are some things to keep in mind when it’s time for the interview:</p>
<ol class="text">Dress up! Show the employer that you take yourself—and the job—seriously by presenting your most professional self. Dress like you were going to court, to church, or to some other important event.Be polite! Make sure to thank the employer for giving you the chance to interview for the job, and shake the interviewer’s hand. Do this BEFORE and AFTER the interview.Be positive and confident! Smile, make eye contact with the interviewer, and show that you are confident in your abilities to be a good employee. Go in with the mindset that you are the best applicant for the job and you will get hired.Take notes! Bring a pencil and paper so that you can write down any important information or questions during the interview. Always start by writing down the interviewer’s name so that you can follow up afterward!</ol>
<h4 class="step">Follow-up after the interview.</h4>
<p class="text">After the interview, it’s important to follow up—this will help to make sure the employer doesn’t forget about you and shows you’re still interested in the job.</p>
<ol class="text">Send a thank you note. A thank-you note will help you stand out from other job applicants. It shows how professional and polite you are, and it gives you another opportunity to sell yourself or re-answer a question that you didn’t handle very well during the interview. Address the note to the person who interviewed you (this is why it’s important to write down their name during the interview).If you don’t get the job, you might consider calling the hiring manager to ask for feedback. You could say something along the lines of: “I know you decided to hire someone else, but I just wanted to find out why I didn’t get the job. I’d appreciate knowing the reason, because your feedback will help me in my job search.” You may get feedback that could actually influence the employer to reconsider your application. If not, you’ll at least receive some useful information that will help with future interviews.<sup><a href="#footnote-1943" id="footnote-ref-1943">[1943]</a></sup> </ol>

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppE"></a>Benefits for Employers: <br/>Federal Bonding Program</div>
<p class="text">This section explains all the eligibility requirements of the Federal Bonding Program and how to apply for the program.<span class="emphasisitalic">WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL BONDING PROGRAM? </span>In order to be eligible for the federal bonding program, you must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p class="listparagraph"><strong>Have a firm job offer (or be already employed) at a job that is likely to be long-term or permanent. The EDD staff will need to verify that the employer is ready to hire you (or keep you on the job) once you have bonding insurance.Be qualified for the job position being offered. In other words, the only thing preventing you from getting the job is the lack of insurance.The position that you are being hired for requires you to be bonded, or you are required to be bonded to remain on the job.You are not commercially bondable, or could be denied commercial bonding coverage because of an arrest record or imprisonment, history of drug or alcohol abuse, poor credit history, lack of employment history, dishonorable discharge from the military, or other “risk” factors.You are 18 or older and legally eligible to work in the U.S. You will have to provide proof of your legal status or documentation for authorization to work in the United States.Are not self-employed or an owner/operator.<sup><a href="#footnote-1944" id="footnote-ref-1944">[1944]</a></sup></strong></p>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">HOW DO I APPLY FOR THE FEDERAL BONDING PROGRAM? </span><strong>STEP 1:</strong>	Visit your local EDD Workforce Services location or America’s Job Center of California (formerly One-Stop Career Center). The only document you need to bring is proof of legal status or eligibility to work in the U.S. (see list of employment verification documents, Appendix A, PG. 673)<sup><a href="#footnote-1945" id="footnote-ref-1945">[1945]</a></sup>—you do NOT need to bring any other paperwork. The EDD staff will contact the employer and/or do other research to make sure that you meet all the other eligibility requirements;<strong>STEP 2:	</strong>The EDD staff person certifies (approves) the bond; and<strong>STEP 3:</strong>	Your insurance coverage will begin as soon as you begin work.<sup><a href="#footnote-1946" id="footnote-ref-1946">[1946]</a></sup>Two important things about bonding:</p>
<ol class="text">Your employer can only get free insurance coverage for the first 6 months that you work there; after that they will have to purchase insurance directly. If you lose your job after 6 months and you suspect that your employer dumped you so that it would not have to pay insurance, you may want to contact the EDD. If you switch to another job that also requires bonding, there is no guarantee that you will be able to get insurance with the new employer.

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppF"></a>Local “Ban the Box” Laws in California</div>
<h4>WHAT IS “BAN THE BOX”?</h4>
<p class="text">WHAT IS THE CALIFORNIA “BAN THE BOX” LAW ALL ABOUT? As of July 1, 2014, state and local agencies can’t ask about your criminal history by any method—verbally (e.g., during an interview), in writing, or on a job application—until after it has decided that you meet the minimum qualifications for the job.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1951" id="footnote-ref-1951">[1951]</a></sup></sup> WHO DOES THE STATEWIDE “BAN THE BOX” LAW APPLY TO? The STATEWIDE law applies to public employers (meaning California state and local governments and agencies), but not private employers and not federal government agencies. However, LOCAL laws might provide more protection for applicants. See more below. WHAT EXTRA PROTECTIONS EXIST IN CERTAIN COUNTIES AND CITIES? Certain cities and counties throughout California have passed their own local “Ban the Box” laws. Some of these local laws give more protection to job applicants with criminal records than the state law does. These local laws only protect you if you are applying for a job within that city or county.The following cities and counties have local “Ban the Box” laws that provide EXTRA protection for applicants with records:</p>
<ol class="text">San Francisco City and County—(see PG. 686)Richmond—(see PG. 690)</ol>
<p class="text">The following cities and counties have local “Ban the Box” laws but they don't provide extra protection for applicants with records:</p>

<p class="text">We will cover two current local laws in this Appendix: (1) the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance (SFFCO) and (2) the Richmond Ordinance. These laws are changing quickly, though, so you should regularly check the status of “Ban the Box” laws in your city and county to be sure you are up-to-date on current law.</p>

<p class="text">If you are applying for a job with a company located in or doing business in the City or County of San Francisco, read this Appendix!</p>
<h4><em>What is San Francisco’s local “Ban the Box” law called?</em></h4>
<p class="text">It is called San Francisco’s Fair Chance Ordinance (SFFCO). It went into effect on August 13, 2014.<sup><a href="#footnote-1954" id="footnote-ref-1954">[1954]</a></sup></p>
<h4><em>Who does SFFCO apply to? </em></h4>
<p class="text">SFFCO applies to private employers with 20 or more employees<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1955" id="footnote-ref-1955">[1955]</a></sup></sup> and city contractors and subcontractors<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1956" id="footnote-ref-1956">[1956]</a></sup></sup> located or doing business in the City and County of San Francisco. It does not matter where the <em>employees</em> are physically located, as long as the <em>employer</em> is located in or doing business in San Francisco. </p>
<h4><em>Can private employers in San Francisco have “blanket bans” against criminal records in a job ad or solicitation?</em></h4>
<p class="text">No. Employers cannot put “blanket bans” (like “no felons” or “no convictions”) in any job ad or solicitation. Ads cannot directly or indirectly express that individuals with a conviction history will not be considered for employment or cannot apply for a position with that employer. The employer MUST:</p>
<ol class="text">State in any job ads or solicitations that it will consider applicants with criminal histories;Post in any workplace a notice of your rights as a job applicant or employee under the SFFCO. (This notice must be in the language(s) that the majority of the employees speak.)</ol>
<h4><em>WHAT can’t a private employer in san francisco ask me about my criminal record under SFFco? </em></h4>
<p class="text">A private employer in San Francisco may never ask about or consider: </p>
<ol class="text">An arrest not leading to a conviction (except arrests that are still pending or unresolved).Participation in a diversion or deferral of judgment program. A diversion program (such as a drug rehabilitation program) helps a person charged with certain crimes avoid criminal charges—and therefore a criminal record.A conviction that has been sealed, dismissed, expunged, or made inoperative.Juvenile records.*A conviction more than 7 years old (based on the date of sentencing).*A criminal offense other than a felony/misdemeanor (for example, an infraction, which is a petty offense that usually comes with a ticket and small fine).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1957" id="footnote-ref-1957">[1957]</a></sup></sup> *</ol>
<p class="text">NOTE: All records marked with a * indicate additions to the California state law protections described on PG. 602.</p>
<h4><em>WHAT can a private employer in San Francisco ask me about my criminal record? </em></h4>
<p class="text">AFTER you are found to be qualified for the job, a live interview has been conducted, or a “conditional offer” of employment has been made, only then can a private employer in San Francisco ask about and consider information from your criminal record—it can only consider the following:</p>
<ol class="text">Your conviction history from the last 0-7 years (based on date of sentencing)—so long as it is not one of the 6 things a private employer in San Francisco can NEVER ask about (listed above) and is directly related to your ability to do the job. Your pending or unresolved arrests—if directly related to your ability to do the job.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1958" id="footnote-ref-1958">[1958]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<p class="text">ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT: If a private employer in San Francisco decides to ask about and consider your conviction history from 0-7 years ago or any pending/unresolved arrests, then the employer must also consider:</p>
<ol class="text">Only “directly-related convictions”—those that directly and negatively relate to your ability to perform duties essential to the job. For example: Will the job give you an opportunity to commit the same crime? Are the factors that led to your crime likely to recur at this particular job? If not, then the employer cannot consider those convictions;The time that has passed since your conviction; ANDAny evidence of errors in your record, your rehabilitation efforts, or other helpful information you offer. This would include things like:Completion of parole or probation;Recommendations from employers;Education or vocational training;Completion or active participation in rehabilitation programs;Letters of recommendation from organizations or individuals who have interacted with you since your conviction. </ol>
<h4><em>WHEN can a private employer in San Francisco ask about my criminal record? What does the process look like?</em></h4>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">PHASE 1:</span> At the beginning of the hiring process, a private employer located or doing business in San Francisco cannot ask about:</p>
<ol class="text">Your conviction history — meaning the employer cannot ask about your criminal convictions on a job application form, during a job screening, in an informal conversation, or otherwise.Your pending or unresolved arrests, whether in a job application form, during a job screening, in an informal conversation, or otherwise.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1959" id="footnote-ref-1959">[1959]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">PHASE 2:</span> The employer must decide that you meet the minimum qualifications for the job, conduct a live interview, or make a conditional offer of employment before asking about or considering certain information in your criminal record.<span class="emphasisheavy">PHASE 3:</span> Before a private employer in San Francisco can about your convictions from 0-7 years ago or any unresolved arrests that directly relate to your ability to do the job, it must:</p>
<ol class="text">Give you notice of the Fair Chance Ordinance; andGive you notice that follows the requirements of California state and U.S. federal laws governing employment background checks.</ol>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">PHASE 4:</span> Only AFTER a private employer in San Francisco has conducted a live interview or made a conditional offer of employment AND has given you all the required notice under federal law, state law, and the SFFCO law, can the employer use information in a background check report, ask about, and consider:</p>
<ol class="text">Your conviction history from the last 0-7 years, if it is outside of the 6 things you can never ask about (discussed above) AND if it directly relates to your ability to do the job. Your pending or unresolved arrests, if they directly relate to your ability to do the job.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1960" id="footnote-ref-1960">[1960]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">PHASE 5:</span> Before a private employer in San Francisco fires, refuses to hire, chooses not to promote, or takes other action that harms you based on a conviction history from 0-7 years ago or an unresolved arrest, the employer must give the you an opportunity to present evidence that: </p>
<ol class="text">The information is inaccurate;You have been rehabilitated, including letters of support and other evidence that you have:Satisfied and completed the terms of parole/probation;Received education and/or training;Participated in alcohol or drug treatment programs;Letters of recommendation;Been free of criminal behavior for a sufficient time period to have changed, based on your age at the time of the conviction; andAll other mitigating factors that led to the conviction and explain or reduce the severity of your criminal behavior, including evidence of:Coercion (you were forced or threatened into doing the illegal act);Physical or emotional abuse (you were experiencing physical or emotional violence that led him/her to do the illegal act); and/orUntreated substance abuse/mental illness that contributed to the conviction (you were addicted to drugs or alcohol, or had a serious mental health issue, and had not received specialized health care treatment for one of those issues).<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1961" id="footnote-ref-1961">[1961]</a></sup></ol>
<h4><em>What if the employer still decides to not hire or promote me, fires me, or takes some other negative employment action against me? </em></h4>
<p class="text">Before the employer makes a final decision about any negative action against you, it must: </p>
<ol class="text">Give you with a copy of the background check report that it based its decision on; Notify you that it intends to take negative action against you; Tell you why you were denied (what the exact issue was in your conviction history); andGive you 7 days to provide information about any errors in you report or your rehabilitation efforts.</ol>
<h4><em>What happens after the 7 days? </em></h4>
<p class="text">The employer may take a reasonable amount of time to reconsider your application in light of any additional information you have offered. It is recommended that you use that one-week period to be very proactive in clearing up information in your record, providing evidence of errors or rehabilitation, etc. If the employer still decides not to hire you based on your conviction history and all the information you have provided, it must give you <em>final notice</em> of its decision.</p>
<div class="titleheading">WHAT You Can DO IF AN EMPLOYER VIOLATED THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE (SFFCO):</div>
<h4><em>What can I do if I think a San Francisco employer has violated the SFFCO? </em></h4>
<h4 class="sidebox">NOTE: Good Faith Mistakes are OKAY.</h4>
<p class="sidebox">There is no punishment for mistakenly accusing an employer of violating the SFFCO, so long as the mistake was in good faith (meaning you weren’t being malicious or trying to abuse or harass the employer).</p>
<p class="text">You can report the violation to San Francisco’s Office of Labor Standards Enforcement (OSLE), and you have 60 days to do so. Call the OSLE office at (415) 554-5192. You can also email the office at <a href="mailto:fce@sfgov.org">fce@sfgov.org</a> (see the OLSE website at: <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/olse/fco">www.sfgov.org/olse/fco</a> for more information). </p>
<h4><em>Can the employer retaliate against me for reporting a violation to the OSLE?</em></h4>
<p class="text">No. An employer may not retaliate against you for exercising your legal rights or for cooperating with the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement (OSLE).</p>
<h4><em>What happens when I report a violation? </em></h4>
<p class="normal1">First, San Francisco’s OLSE will investigate the employer. Second, if the OLSE finds a violation, it may “order any appropriate relief.” This usually means that the OLSE will give a warning or fine the employer:</p>
<ol class="text">If it is the employer’s first violation, or if it occurs before August 13, 2015 (any time in the first year that the SFFCO law is in effect), the OLSE will issue a warning and give the employer a chance to change its policies.If there are additional violations after the first warning, the OLSE will begin fining the employer for each violation.If the employer refuses to comply in a timely manner, OLSE may refer the case to the City Attorney to file a civil action against the employer for relief.</ol>
<h4><em>Can OLSE force the employer to give me the job? </em></h4>
<p class="text">Probably not. In general, OLSE will NOT force an employer to hire someone, even if the employer violated the law by rejecting you for the job. However, OLSE has been very successful at resolving violations informally, simply by talking with the employer and applicant. For example, OLSE might ask the employer to reconsider your application, give you the opportunity to apply for another job, or let you submit a new application without prejudice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1962" id="footnote-ref-1962">[1962]</a></sup></p>
<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_H_BanTheBox_Richmond"></a>Appendix H</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppH"></a>City of Richmond, CA:<br/>“Ban the Box” Ordinance</div>
<p class="text">If you are applying to a job with a company located or doing business in the City of Richmond, read this section!</p>
<h4><em>What is the City of Richmond’s local “ban the box” ordinance?</em></h4>
<p class="text">It is a law (a city ordinance) that prevents certain types of employers—all contractors and subcontractors getting money from the City of Richmond, with at 10 or more full-time employees—from asking about criminal convictions in the initial job application.<sup><a href="#footnote-1963" id="footnote-ref-1963">[1963]</a></sup></p>
<h4><em>What does the ordinance require/prohibit? </em></h4>
<p class="text">The Richmond “Ban the Box” law prohibits these types of employers (city-paid contractors and subcontractors) from asking any questions regarding prior criminal convictions on any printed or online employment application forms. The ordinance prohibits employers from making “any inquiry into an applicant’s conviction history.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1964" id="footnote-ref-1964">[1964]</a></sup></p>
<h4><em>So an employer in Richmond can never ask about my conviction history?</em></h4>
<p class="text">Not exactly. There are exceptions: <span class="emphasisitalic">Exception 1:</span> The Richmond ordinance does not prohibit employers who are required by state or federal law to conduct background checks from looking into your conviction history.<sup><a href="#footnote-1965" id="footnote-ref-1965">[1965]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">Exception 2:</span> The ordinance does not prohibit employers looking to fill “Sensitive Positions” from considering your conviction history. A “Sensitive” position is a position that has one or more of the following job characteristics:</p>
<ol class="text">Regular unsupervised handling of large amounts of cash;Regular unsupervised handling of other people’s private, personal, and confidential information Regular unsupervised contact with children under 16;Regular unsupervised contact with the elderly or disabled;Regular unsupervised responsibility for operating a bus, taxi, or limousine used to transport the general public;Any position in a business that requires regular unsupervised entry into private premises;Any position in a business that involves unsupervised handling of hazardous substances. </ol>
<h4><em>When can an employer ask about my conviction history? </em></h4>
<p class="text">If the employer falls under one of the exceptions, the employer can only conduct a background check after determining you are otherwise qualified for the position AND after extending a conditional offer of employment to you.</p>
<h4><em>How can an employer consider my conviction history? </em></h4>
<p class="text">An employer can only consider convictions that are “substantially job-related,” and must conduct an individualized assessment, considering: the amount of time that has elapsed since the conviction; and any evidence of rehabilitation or other mitigating circumstances.</p>
<h4><em>What if the employer denies me a job because of my conviction history? </em></h4>
<p class="text">If an employer denies you a job because of a substantially job-related conviction, it must: give you a written notice of rejection, including how the conviction is related to the job; and give you the opportunity to correct any mistakes in your record and offer evidence of rehabilitation or other mitigating circumstances. </p>
<h4><em>What can I do if an employer has violated the Richmond ordinance? </em></h4>
<p class="text">The most obvious violation of the ordinance is failure to remove all questions regarding criminal history on the initial job application. Although all employers must file a copy of their standard application with the city as part of the formal bidding process, mistakes can happen. If you think a covered employer in Richmond has violated the ordinance, contact the City Manager (Bill Lindsay at the time of publication):</p>
<p class="address">450 Civic Center Plaza, Suite 300; Richmond, CA 94804; Phone: (510) 620-6512; Fax: (510) 620-6542</p>
<h4><em>What happens to an employer who violates the Richmond Ordinance?</em></h4>
<p class="text">Employers have 30 days from receiving the notice of a violation to comply with the ordinance. The Richmond City Manager also has the legal authority to fine employers, to suspend or terminate their lease or contract with the city, to deny future leases or contracts, or to order any other legal remedy available.</p>

<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_J_TitleVII"></a>Appendix J</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppJ"></a>Civil Rights Law that Governs Employers’ Hiring Decisions: Title VII</div>
<p class="text">This section will explain Title VII, which is the federal civil rights law that governs employers’ hiring and employment decisions related to your criminal record.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS TITLE VII? </h4>
<p class="text">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal law that prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of a person’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.<sup><a href="#footnote-1966" id="footnote-ref-1966">[1966]</a></sup> Title VII protects the rights of employees AND job applicants against discrimination by employers.</p>
<h4>WHAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO FOLLOW TITLE VII RULES? </h4>
<p class="text">Title VII applies to all private and public employers with 15 or more employees. This includes federal, state, and local governments; private and public colleges and universities; employment agencies; and labor organizations (unions).<sup><a href="#footnote-1967" id="footnote-ref-1967">[1967]</a></sup></p>
<h4>WHAT IS CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF TITLE VII?</h4>
<p class="text">Title VII violations can occur in two situations: where there is disparate treatment (unequal treatment) OR where there is disparate impact (unequal impact).<span class="emphasisitalic">Disparate Treatment Discrimination (Unequal Treatment):</span> An employer might be engaging in <em>disparate treatment discrimination</em> if they treat you and your criminal history differently than they treat other applicants with similar criminal records, because of your race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. For example, if an employer rejects a Black applicant based on his/her criminal record, but then hires a White applicant with similar qualifications and a similar criminal record, the employer is likely violating Title VII by illegally treating one person’s criminal history more negatively because of his/her race. Similarly, an employer may be violating Title VII if they only do background checks for Black or Latino applicants, but do not run background checks on White applicants for the same position.<span class="emphasisitalic">Disparate Impact Discrimination (Unequal Impact):</span>An employer might be engaging in <em>disparate impact discrimination</em> if they have a policy of not hiring people with certain kinds of criminal histories, and that policy is more harmful to people of a certain race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. For example, employers who have a “blanket ban” policy that excludes all applicants with criminal records would cause greater harm to Black and Latino applicants, who are incarcerated at dramatically higher rates than people of other races in the United States. <sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1968" id="footnote-ref-1968">[1968]</a></sup></sup> However, an employer may legally exclude certain job applicants based on their criminal history if the employer shows that doing so is necessary for the specific position and business.</p>
<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_K_EEOC"></a>Appendix K</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppK"></a>Civil Rights Law that Governs Employers’ Hiring Decisions:<br/>EEOC Enforcement Guidance </div>
<p class="text">This section will explain the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the EEOC Enforcement Guidance. The EEOC is the federal government agency responsible for enforcing the civil rights of job applicants and employees. The EEOC Enforcement Guidance is a report that explains how and when employers can consider your criminal record when deciding whether to hire or fire you. </p>
<h4>WHAT IS THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION (EEOC)? </h4>
<p class="text">The EEOC is a government agency that enforces Title VII and other civil rights laws that prohibit illegal discrimination against job applicants and employees. These laws protect you against unfair treatment based on your race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1969" id="footnote-ref-1969">[1969]</a></sup> California law requires employers to fully follow all federal laws regarding how employers can consider your criminal history when hiring. This means that all employers must follow the EEOC guidelines, or else they have broken both federal and state law.<sup><a href="#footnote-1970" id="footnote-ref-1970">[1970]</a></sup></p>
<h4>WHAT IS EEOC ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE? </h4>
<p class="text">The EEOC investigates claims of discrimination by employers, and also issues special guidelines and “enforcement guidance” reports for employers to help them follow Title VII and other civil rights laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-1971" id="footnote-ref-1971">[1971]</a></sup> The EEOC’s Enforcement Guidance is a report that describes how and when employers can use your criminal record to make employment decisions. The Enforcement Guidance says that—before making any negative decision based on your record, such as rejecting your job application—an employer must consider the nature of your conviction, the type of job you’ve applied for, and how much time has passed since the conviction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1972" id="footnote-ref-1972">[1972]</a></sup> The employer should also consider your individual situation and give you a chance to explain yourself, including the circumstances of your conviction and why you would still be a good employee.<sup><a href="#footnote-1973" id="footnote-ref-1973">[1973]</a></sup> However, the Enforcement Guidance does NOT have the same power as an actual law—it is basically a set of recommended rules for how employers <em>should</em> act and how courts <em>should</em> enforce the law. Courts should consider the Enforcement Guidance and may be persuaded to follow the EEOC’s recommendations, but they are not required to follow these rules. To read the complete EEOC Enforcement Guidance, see <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/upload/arrest_conviction.pdf">http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/upload/arrest_conviction.pdf</a>.For more information about the EEOC Enforcement Guidance, see the following resources:</p>

<p class="text">Note: The EEOC is a federal government agency and enforces federal civil rights laws. California also has a state agency, called the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) that enforces state civil rights laws against discrimination.

<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_O_EEOC_ComplaintProcess"></a>Appendix O</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_App_O"></a>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Complaint Process</div>
<p class="text">This section will explain the process for filing a discrimination complaint with the federal EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission).</p>
<h4 class="step">Filing a Complaint. </h4>
<p class="text">The process begins when you contact the EEOC and file a formal complaint, called a "Charge of Discrimination," following the steps described in the previous question. When you file your complaint, the EEOC will give you a copy of the complaint, along with your charge number (which is the number used to identify your case).</p>
<h4 class="step">Notice to the Employer &amp; Mediation. </h4>
<p class="text">Within 10 days, the EEOC will also send a notice and a copy of the charge to the employer. The EEOC may ask both you and the employer to agree to participate in mediation, which is an informal way of trying to resolve the problem instead of filing a lawsuit.<strong> What happens in mediation?</strong> Mediation is an informal way for people to resolve problems with the help of a neutral person (a mediator) who is trained to help people discuss their differences. If you and the employer agree to<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/employees/mediation.cfm"> </a>mediation, the mediator will try to help you both reach a voluntary resolution (settlement agreement). The mediator does not decide who is right or wrong or make a decision about your complaint. Instead, the mediator helps you and the employer work out your own solution to the problem. Everything that happens in mediation is confidential and free. Mediation can also be a faster way of resolving the dispute, since it usually takes less than 3 months to settle a complaint through mediation. If you and the employer cannot reach an agreement, the EEOC will continue to investigate your case just like any other.<sup><a href="#footnote-1974" id="footnote-ref-1974">[1974]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">Employer’s Response. </h4>
<p class="text">If your case is not sent to mediation, or if mediation doesn’t resolve the problem, the EEOC will ask the employer to respond (submit a written answer) to your complaint, and answer any questions that the EEOC has about your complaint. Then your complaint will be given to an EEOC investigator for investigation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1975" id="footnote-ref-1975">[1975]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">Investigation. </h4>
<p class="text">How the EEOC investigates a complaint depends on the specific facts of your case and the kinds of information that will be helpful. In some cases, an EEOC representative may visit the employer, interview other employees or witnesses, gather documents, and/or take other steps to find out whether the employer committed illegal discrimination. The EEOC may also interview you again, or ask you for other documents or information—so it’s very important to cooperate and keep in touch! <strong>How long will the investigation take?</strong> How long the investigation takes depends on a lot of different things, including the amount of information that the EEOC needs to get and evaluate. It may take up to 6 months or longer to investigate a charge.<sup><a href="#footnote-1976" id="footnote-ref-1976">[1976]</a></sup> <strong>What if the employer refuses to cooperate with the investigation?</strong> If an employer refuses to cooperate with an EEOC investigation, the EEOC can issue a subpoena (legal order) that requires the employer to turn over documents and information and/or answer legal questions, and allows the EEOC to enter the employer’s facilities.</p>
<h4 class="step">Decision. </h4>
<p class="text">After the investigation is completed, the EEOC will issue a decision, and let you and the employer know the results. The decision will say either:</p>
<ol class="text">NO CAUSE—meaning the EEOC did NOT find any evidence that the employer illegally discriminated against you; orREASONABLE CAUSE—meaning the EEOC thinks the employer DID illegally discriminate against you.</ol>
<h4 class="step">Your Options After the EEOC Decision. </h4>
<p class="text">Depending on what the EEOC decision says, these are your options:</p>
<ol class="text">NO CAUSE decision—If the EEOC does NOT find that the employer illegally discriminated against you, it will send you a Right-to-Sue notice. This notice allows you to file a lawsuit in court against the employer on your own. (However, it may be difficult to win in court without the EEOC’s support.) You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) of receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late. REASONABLE CAUSE decision—If the EEOC finds that the employer DID illegally discriminate against you, it will first try to reach a voluntary settlement (called “conciliation”) with the employer. Conciliation usually means that the employer agrees to pay you to cover the harm from the discrimination.If the EEOC can’t reach a settlement with the employer, the EEOC’s lawyers may decide to file a lawsuit against the employer on your behalf. If the EEOC decides not to file a lawsuit, it will give you a Right-to-Sue notice, which allows you to file a lawsuit against the employer on your own. You must file a lawsuit within 90 days (approximately 3 months) of receiving the Right-to-Sue Notice; otherwise it will be too late.<sup><a href="#footnote-1977" id="footnote-ref-1977">[1977]</a></sup></ol>

<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_P_DFEH_ComplaintProcess"></a>Appendix P</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_App_P"></a>California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) Complaint Process</div>
<p class="text">This section will explain the process for filing a discrimination complaint with the California DFEH (Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing).<sup><a href="#footnote-1978" id="footnote-ref-1978">[1978]</a></sup>The DFEH complaint process is very similar to the EEOC process, and can even happen at the same time. </p>
<h4 class="step">Report Discrimination. </h4>
<p class="text">The DFEH process begins when you contact the DFEH to report the discrimination and file a “Pre-Complaint Inquiry.” You can do this by mail, by phone, or online:</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Mail:</span> Fill out a Pre-Complaint Inquiry form and mail it to any local DFEH office. A listing of local DFEH offices can be found in Appendix M, PG. 699.<sup><a href="#footnote-1979" id="footnote-ref-1979">[1979]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Phone:</span> Call the DFEH Communication Center at (800) 884-1684. If you have a hearing impairment, call 800-884-1684 or TTY at (800) 700-2320 for service.<span class="emphasisitalic">Online: </span>Use the DFEH’s online system (available at <a href="http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/">http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/</a>), or email the Pre-Complaint Inquiry form to <a href="mailto:contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov">contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov</a>.</ol>
<h4 class="step">Filing an Official Complaint. </h4>
<p class="text">Within 10 days, a DFEH investigator will contact you to conduct an intake interview, in order to learn more about your situation and the possible discrimination. The investigator will decide whether state and federal civil rights laws cover your situation. If the DFEH accepts your complaint, the investigator will type up an official complaint for you to sign. If the DFEH does NOT accept your complaint, it does not mean that you weren’t treated unfairly—only that your situation is not covered by the civil rights laws that the DFEH enforces. </p>
<h5 class="question">Can I go straight to court and file a lawsuit on my own?</h5>
<p class="address">Under California law (just like Title VII), you must first file a complaint with DFEH before you can go to court (this is called “exhausting your administrative remedies”).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1980" id="footnote-ref-1980">[1980]</a></sup></strong> However, once you file your complaint, you can ask the DFEH for a Right-to-Sue notice right away, which allows you to file a lawsuit in court on your own. Once you receive a Right-to-Sue notice, you have only 1 year to file your lawsuit in court.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1981" id="footnote-ref-1981">[1981]</a></sup></strong></p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you request a Right-to-Sue notice, the DFEH will close your case and will NOT investigate further (even if you later decide not to file a lawsuit). Therefore, it is recommended that you only request a Right-to-Sue notice if you have a lawyer to represent you in court.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1982" id="footnote-ref-1982">[1982]</a></sup></strong></p>
<h4 class="step">Employer’s Response. </h4>
<p class="text">The DFEH will give a copy of your complaint to the employer. The employer must respond to the complaint, and has the opportunity to voluntarily resolve the problem now or at any time during the rest of the case. The DFEH will also file a copy of your complaint with the EEOC if it looks like Title VII covers your complaint.<sup><a href="#footnote-1983" id="footnote-ref-1983">[1983]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">Investigation. </h4>
<p class="text">The DFEH will investigate your complaint. The investigation may include conducting interviews with people and gathering documents or other information. The DFEH must complete its investigation within 1 year from the date when you filed your official complaint. Before the DFEH notifies you of the results of the investigation, it will give you and the employer the chance to voluntarily resolve the problem by reaching an agreement through informal negotiations (“mediation” or “conciliation”).</p>
<h4 class="step">After the Investigation. </h4>
<p class="text">Depending on what the DFEH finds during its investigation, this is what will happen next: </p>
<ol class="text">If the investigation shows that the employer DID violate the law, the DFEH will try to resolve the complaint through “conciliation” (voluntary agreement) with the employer (see Step 6).If the investigation shows that the employer did NOT violate the law, the DFEH will close your case and give you a Right-to-Sue notice. The Right-to-Sue notice allows you to file a lawsuit in court against the employer on your own.</ol>
<h4 class="step">Conciliation. </h4>
<p class="text">During conciliation, the DFEH will attempt to resolve your complaint by reaching a voluntary settlement agreement with the employer. (This is just like what happens in the EEOC complaint process, after the EEOC makes a Reasonable Cause decision.) </p>
<h4 class="step">Possible Litigation. </h4>
<p class="text">If the DFEH cannot reach an agreement with the employer, it may decide to file a lawsuit against the employer on your behalf. If the DFEH does not file a lawsuit against the employer, it will give you a Right-to-Sue notice that allows you to file a lawsuit in court on your own.<sup><a href="#footnote-1984" id="footnote-ref-1984">[1984]</a></sup></p>
<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_Q_ProfessionalLicensing"></a>Appendix Q</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppQ"></a>Professional/Occupational Licensing—Appeals Process</div>
<p class="text">This section will give you an overview of the appeals process if the licensing board denies your application for a professional or occupational license.</p>
<p class="answer">Note: Each licensing agency is different! This is just a general overview to prepare you for what the process is like, but it will be slightly different in every situation.</p>
<h4 class="step">Notice. </h4>
<p class="text">If a licensing board decides to deny your license, it must notify you in one of the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-1985" id="footnote-ref-1985">[1985]</a></sup></p>
<ol class="text"><strong>Statement of Issues:</strong> The board files and serves you with a formal written statement of the board’s decision to deny you a license. It must specify any rules or statutes that you are not in compliance with, and the facts that authorize the denial. The statement of issues initiates a formal hearing on the matter;<sup><a href="#footnote-1986" id="footnote-ref-1986">[1986]</a></sup> or<strong>Informal notice of denial:</strong> The board serves you with a written notice of denial, but does not file the notice with the court. The notice must state: the reason for the denial and your right to request a hearing on the denial.<sup><a href="#footnote-1987" id="footnote-ref-1987">[1987]</a></sup></ol>
<h4 class="step">Notice of Defense or Request for a Hearing </h4>
<ol class="text"><strong>Notice of Defense:</strong> If the board files and serves you with a formal statement of issues, you have 15 days to file what is called a “Notice of Defense” with the board, which means you want a formal hearing on the matter. If you do not file a Notice of Defense (or file it late, past the 15 days allowed), you will give up your right to a hearing (called a “default”). The licensing board can take whatever action it pleases, which is usually the harshest, i.e. denial of your license, and you can’t challenge it. (Note: a licensing board has discretion to allow/honor late notices and to grant a hearing after a default, but chances are slim.) Typically a generic notice of default “postcard” is included with the statement. This is the easiest way to preserve your right. The notice of defense need only contain your address and signature to be sufficient.<sup><a href="#footnote-1988" id="footnote-ref-1988">[1988]</a></sup><strong>Written Request for a Hearing:</strong> If the board does not file a formal statement of issues, but instead sends you an informal notice of denial, you have 60 days to file a written request for a hearing with the board. </ol>
<h4 class="step">Stipulated Settlement.</h4>
<p class="text">In many cases, you can resolve your case before by agreeing to a voluntary settlement (called a “stipulated settlement”) with the licensing board. A stipulated settlement is sort of like a plea bargain—you admit to doing something wrong, and you agree to accept a certain amount of punishment from the board. Often this means that you will get your license on a conditional basis for a certain amount of time (a “probation” period). You will have to meet certain requirements—such as participating in counseling or other behavioral programs, taking specific classes or exams, having your work monitored by a supervisor, getting drug tested, completing community service, and/or temporary suspension—during the probation period.<sup><a href="#footnote-1989" id="footnote-ref-1989">[1989]</a></sup> If you complete all the requirements, you can get your full license back. If you do NOT complete the requirements, the board can revoke your license.<sup><a href="#footnote-1990" id="footnote-ref-1990">[1990]</a></sup>A stipulated settlement can be complicated, so it is recommended to have a lawyer represent you. You may be able to negotiate certain parts of the settlement agreement—such as what wrongdoing you will admit to; what conditions you will have to complete during the probation period; and how much you will have to pay in recovery costs to get your license. If you reach this point, you should think about what issues are most important to you—for example, whether you want the shortest possible probation, or to pay the smallest amount, or to avoid admitting certain wrongdoing.<sup><a href="#footnote-1991" id="footnote-ref-1991">[1991]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">The Formal Hearing.</h4>
<p class="text">If you don’t reach a stipulated settlement with the licensing board, you will have a formal administrative hearing. An administrative hearing is somewhat like a trial. There will be a judge and a court reporter. The board will be represented either by in-house counsel (its own attorney) or the California Attorney General (like a prosecutor for the entire state). You are allowed to have an attorney also, but you are not entitled to one, so you will have to pay for your attorney yourself. Both sides will present evidence, put on witnesses (if necessary), and make arguments. <sup><a href="#footnote-1992" id="footnote-ref-1992">[1992]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">The Decision. </h4>
<p class="text">After the case is presented, the administrative law judge (ALJ) will issue an advisory decision within about 30 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-1993" id="footnote-ref-1993">[1993]</a></sup> </p>

<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTGetting Funding for a Small Business</h4>
<p class="textbox">Some organizations and government agencies provide money to small businesses and people trying to start their own business. Sometimes the funding is through grants—money that you do NOT have to repay, but generally must use in a certain way related to the business. More often, the funding is through loans—money that you DO have to repay (usually with interest) in the future.Unfortunately, it can be difficult to get loans depending on your conviction record. One place to start is the U.S. Small Business Administration, which is planning to change its policy to allow people on probation or parole to be eligible for microloans of up to $50,000.<sup><a href="#footnote-1994" id="footnote-ref-1994">[1994]</a></sup> However, you may still be denied if you’ve been convicted of a felony “crime of moral turpitude” (i.e., involving violence or dishonesty).<sup><a href="#footnote-1995" id="footnote-ref-1995">[1995]</a></sup> For this reason, it may be helpful to contact one of the entrepreneurship programs listed to see if they have suggestions or resources to find funding.</p>

Employers like to do this this because it means they have fewer responsibilities, and you have fewer rights, if you are an independent contractor—and often they will misclassify you in order to avoid following the law! For this reason, it’s important that you know the difference so that you don’t get exploited!In general, you are an employee (NOT an independent contractor) if the following are true:</p>
<ol class="text">The employer decides what tasks and assignments you do and directs your work; The employer controls how, where, and when you do your work; The employer supervises your work, and you’re required to follow their instructions; The employer trains you in how to do your work;The employer provides you with any necessary equipment, tools, and other materials;The work you do is a regular and necessary part of the employer’s business—not just a side activity;The employer sets your hours and pays you a set wage or salary;The employer has the right to fire you—and you have the right to quit—at any time.<sup><a href="#footnote-1996" id="footnote-ref-1996">[1996]</a></sup></ol>
<p class="text">In addition, the law generally presumes that you are an employee—and NOT an independent contractor—unless specific factors show otherwise.<sup><a href="#footnote-1997" id="footnote-ref-1997">[1997]</a></sup> </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Whether you are an employee or an independent contractor depends on the specific details of your work situation and your relationship with the employer—NOT on what the employer calls you!</p>
<h4>WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AS AN EMPLOYEE (VS. AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR)?</h4>
<p class="text">As an employee, you have the right to be paid minimum wage and overtime, receive meal periods and rest breaks, and get reimbursed by the employer for any work-related expenses (such as purchasing a required uniform). You also have the right to receive workers compensation insurance, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and social security, and the employer is required withhold payroll taxes (which are taken out of your paycheck) and send these payments to the government.</p>
<h4>WHAT ARE MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR (VS. an EMPLOYEE)?</h4>
<p class="text">On the other hand, if you are an independent contractor, you are NOT protected by minimum wage, overtime, and other labor laws. In addition, you have certain responsibilities—like filing self-employment taxes and reporting certain business information to the government—that you must follow. For more information about the legal responsibilities of an independent contractor, visit the EDD website on independent contractor reporting at <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/payroll_taxes/faq_-_california_independent_contractor_reporting.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/payroll_taxes/faq_-_california_independent_contractor_reporting.htm#Whohastoreport</a>.</p>
<h4>WHAT CAN I DO IF I THINK AN EMPLOYER HAS VIOLATED MY RIGHTS AS AN EMPLOYEE OR WRONGLY CLASSIFIED ME AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?</h4>
<p class="text">The California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) is the state agency responsible for enforcing your rights in the workplace. If you think an employer has violated your rights as an employee, wrongly classified you as an independent contractor, and/or for more information, you can contact your local DLSE office and speak with Deputy Labor Commissioner.

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppT"></a>Employment Rights for People with Disabilities: Exceptions Where an Employer Does Not Have to Provide a Reasonable Accommodation to an Employee</div>
<p class="text">There are 3 situations where an employer is NOT required to provide a reasonable accommodation for your disability: These are called the “<em>Undue Hardship</em>” exception, the “<em>Direct Threat</em>” exception, and the exception for when the employer shows that you <em>CANNOT safely perform essential job functions</em>. This section will explain each of these exceptions. </p>
<div class="headingboldunderl11">(1) UNDUE HARDSHIP</div>
<p class="text">An employer does NOT have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer. There is no single definition of “undue hardship”—it is a case-by-case question that depends on the type of accommodation you’re requesting and the employer’s particular situation—e.g., what type of business it is, how many employees, the employer’s financial situation, etc. In general, however, an undue hardship means that the accommodation you want would be too expensive or difficult for the employer make, or would have a significant impact on the employer’s business, or would be too disruptive to the business or to the work of other employees.However, an employer CANNOT claim undue hardship based on employees' (or customers') fears or prejudices about your disability (e.g., fears or prejudices about people with past addictions or mental health issues). Also, an employer CANNOT claim that other employees would be upset about giving you an accommodation. Finally, an employer CANNOT claim that making an accommodation—for example, hiring someone with a criminal conviction—would cause their insurance premiums to go up.<sup><a href="#footnote-1998" id="footnote-ref-1998">[1998]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">Important:</span> Even if an employer can show that the particular accommodation you asked for would cause undue hardship, the employer may still have to provide a different accommodation if there is some other type of accommodation that would also be effective and would NOT cause a hardship.<sup><a href="#footnote-1999" id="footnote-ref-1999">[1999]</a></sup> </p>
<div class="headingboldunderl11">(2) DIRECT THREAT</div>
<p class="text">The law does not require that an employer give you reasonable accommodations for your disability if you would pose a significant danger to the health or safety of yourself or others AND there is NO possible reasonable accommodation that would remove or reduce the risk of harm.<sup><a href="#footnote-2000" id="footnote-ref-2000">[2000]</a></sup> There are some protections for you if an employer is arguing that you would be a direct threat to other employees, customers or property:</p>
<ol class="text">First, an employer must first make an individualized assessment of you and whether you can safely perform the essential functions of the job.<sup><a href="#footnote-2001" id="footnote-ref-2001">[2001]</a></sup>Second, an employer can only reject you if you pose a significant risk of harm to others and there is a high likelihood that you will harm someone due to your condition.<sup><a href="#footnote-2002" id="footnote-ref-2002">[2002]</a></sup>Third, in deciding whether your conditions creates a significant risk of harm, the employer must consider your individual situation and history of substance/alcohol abuse—for example, whether you have a history of harmful behavior due to your addiction—and CANNOT simply go on assumptions or statistics about people who suffer from substance/alcohol addiction and their likelihood of relapse.<sup><a href="#footnote-2003" id="footnote-ref-2003">[2003]</a></sup>Fourth, the employer’s evaluation must rely on the most current medical knowledge and the best available objective evidence—NOT simply stereotypes, fears, or assumptions about people with mental illness, addiction, or other disabilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-2004" id="footnote-ref-2004">[2004]</a></sup></ol>
<div class="headingboldunderl11">(3) CANNOT SAFELY PERFORM ESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS. </div>
<p class="text">Finally, an employer is NOT required to provide reasonable accommodations if they can show that you are unable to safely perform essential job functions—in other words, you are not qualified for the job—even with a reasonable accommodation.<sup><a href="#footnote-2005" id="footnote-ref-2005">[2005]</a></sup> However, an employer can only make this argument based on the specific requirements of the job position you are seeking (not general requirements for other types of jobs), and if there are NO reasonable accommodations that could enable you to do the work.<sup><a href="#footnote-2006" id="footnote-ref-2006">[2006]</a></sup></p>
<div class="appendix"><a id="EM_App_U_Disabilities_ReasonableAccommod"></a>Appendix U</div>
<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="EM_TOC_AppU"></a>Employment Rights for People with Disabilities: Requesting a Reasonable Accommodation for Your Disability</div>
<p class="text">If an employer’s hiring/employment policy causes your job application to be rejected (or causes other adverse action against you) based on a conviction that was caused by your disability, you have the right to request a “reasonable accommodation” so that you can be considered for the job just like other applicants.To request an accommodation, the law only requires you to tell the employer that you need an accommodation for a reason related to a medical condition. You do NOT have to put your request in writing, and you do NOT have to use any special legal language—you can explain your request in normal words. You can request an accommodation at any time during the job application process or after you begin working.<sup><a href="#footnote-2007" id="footnote-ref-2007">[2007]</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="sidebox"><span class="emphasisitalic">HELPFUL HINT:</span> </h4>
<p class="sidebox">You can also have someone else talk to the employer for you, to ask for the accommodation you need. In this case, you may want to ask your case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or another trusted person who is helping you with your job search, to speak with the employer on your behalf.</p>
<p class="text">HOWEVER, because it is generally believed that employers are less likely to be sympathetic and less willing to change policies regarding criminal convictions (even where the conviction was caused by your disability), it is recommended that you give the employer a WRITTEN LETTER requesting the reasonable accommodation. (Be sure to make a photocopy for yourself before sending the letter). This will make it more difficult for the employer to ignore your request, and you will have documentation in case the employer denies it.It’s recommended that your letter clearly include ALL of the following:</p>
<ol class="text">Explain that you have a disability, and what that disability is.Include any documentation of your disability and treatment.Clearly state the accommodation you are requesting (for example, that you are asking the employer to make an exception to the hiring policy that would exclude you due to a criminal conviction that was caused by your disability, or you are asking for time off to attend treatment).Explain the reason that you are requesting the accommodation:Here, you could say that an exception from criminal history policy is NECESSARY to give you an equal opportunity to participate in the job.Explain the connection (meaning the relationship or “nexus”) between the requested accommodation and your disability. Explain how your criminal conduct was the result of the mental illness and/or past substance abuse (for example, state that you were convicted of drug possession because you were addicted to drugs, but you have successfully completed rehab).It is helpful and more persuasive if you have a doctor or service provider submit a letter explaining why your disability requires a reasonable accommodation. </ol>
