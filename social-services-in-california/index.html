<p>
  SOCIAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA 
</p>

<p>
  DEAR READERS:
</p>

<p>
  Root & Rebound is a reentry legal advocacy nonprofit. Our approach is based on the idea that attorneys and advocates can transfer powerful legal knowledge and skills to those who are in reentry and otherwise impacted by the criminal justice system, as well as the families, agencies, and communities that support them. With such a severe "justice gap" in our country and only one legal aid attorney for every 8,000 indigent people in California, we aim to create and share reentry legal information and resources that empower people to know their rights and options in reentry, with an educational approach instead of the traditional 1-to-1 client-attorney relationship.
</p>

<p>
  As part of our approach, we produce reentry resources like the Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide, and other accompanying toolkits; we train community members, currently and formerly incarcerated people, and professionals working with the reentry population on this information; we run our weekly Reentry Legal Hotline (every Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., at 510-279-4662—we accept Collect Calls); and we respond to prison mail from currently incarcerated people looking for information about their rights, options, and supportive services in reentry.
</p>

<p>
  We realize that information about legal issues related to reentry are often accompanied by the need to meet other basic needs post-release as well, things like food, housing, employment, health care and treatment, and other forms of social services support. While Root & Rebound is NOT a social service agency—meaning we do not directly provide housing or jobs—we recognize the importance of making those connections with social services providers in the community and do our absolute best to know which agencies across the state of California are providing supportive social services to people in reentry.
</p>

<p>
  We are constantly discovering new community resources in California, and they are always expanding, diversifying, closing or otherwise changing. Because of this, it was not practical to list every social service agency in our Roadmap to Reentry guide. Instead, we have created a series of county-based template information letters at our office. The information letters are collections of referral lists and flyers, guides produced by other organizations, and directories from county governments, as well as contact information for the organizations we have worked with or trained in the past. We add to these templates when we find new resources and try to check to make sure the contact information is current on a yearly basis—but we do not have the capacity as a legal office to make sure they are 100% up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
  If you would like a social service referral in the community to which you are returning (for example, you are looking for food, housing, employment or workforce development services, public benefits enrollment, health care, reentry support, legal aid services, etc.), OR believe you know of agencies and services that we don’t, please feel free to write Root & Rebound a letter at the following mailing address: 1730 Franklin St., Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94612, or call our Reentry Legal Hotline any Friday, from 9 a.m. – 5 p.m., at phone number (510) 279-4662 (we accept Collect Calls). You may ask for resources for all counties you are interested in, and we will send you the information that we have in our office. In addition to contacting our office, you can also try some of the following statewide resources listed below for referrals.
</p>

  Finally, we have listed here some resources that are specific to certain populations, which may be helpful, and which you may write or call us to request.

Federal law also makes it a crime for an ex-felon to possess a firearm or ammunition that has been shipped or transported through interstate or foreign commerce. A certificate of rehabilitation (see PG. 153) does not restore the right to possess a firearm. In some cases, but not all, the right can be restored by a full pardon. ↑ You may not own, use, posses, or have access to a weapon as defined in state or federal laws, or any device, which a reasonable person would believe to be capable of being used as a weapon. ↑ CDCR, Notice and Conditions of Parole, http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Regulations/Adult_Operations/docs/NCDR/2014NCR/14-03/CDCR 1515.pdf. ↑ Cal.

Because of the major changes in parole laws, the court overseeing Valdivia decided that the case is “moot” (meaning no longer applicable) and that any problems with the new parole revocation procedures will have to be raised in new cases. Thus, advocates for people on parole have expressed concerns that there could be long delays between the placement of parole holds in jail and CDCR’s filing of revocation petitions. Advocates are also concerned that parolees may be pressured into giving up their rights and taking “screening offers” (like a parole revocation plea bargain) without having an opportunity to consult with an attorney.

Thus, upon the your request, the people who gave the information that proves the parole violation charge should be made available for you to question them at the hearing, unless the judge determines that requiring the witness to appear would create a risk of harm. If the state has “good cause” (a good explanation or reason) for failing to present a witness and that good cause outweighs your right to confront the witness, the witness’s prior statements may be presented at the hearing, even if those statements were made outside of court. The more important the witness’s testimony is to the case, the stronger your right to confront and cross-examine that witness is. Courts may overturn a parole revocation if the hearing officer relies on unsworn hearsay (out of court statements) without determining the unavailability of the declarant or the reliability of the hearsay, or without considering the parolee’s interests prior to admitting the evidence.

With regard to the revocation of probation, the Court subsequently held that “a probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in Morrissey.” Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973). Thus, the State “must provide the same process [found in Morrissey ] when terminating a probationer from probation.” State v.

If the hearing officer determines that there is “good cause” that a witness does not have to testify, then the hearing officer may take into consideration that witness’s past out-of-court statements, even though the witness will not be in court you to confront. For example, if a judge determines that there is “good cause” that a witness’s safety will be in danger if he or she testifies at your probation revocation hearing, then the witness’s past statements are admissible at your hearing. But remember—the more important the witness’s testimony is to the case, the stronger your right to confront and question that witness is (see U.S. v.

Ever since 1984 (the time when the “Sentencing Reform Act” went into effect), federal criminal courts; see also United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2012/manual-pdf/Chapter_7.pdf.  ↑ See United States Probation Office, Central District of California, Frequently Asked Questions, http://www.cacp.U.S.C.ourts.gov/faq. ↑ 18 U.S.C. § 3564(d).  ↑ Telephone call with Duty Officer at the San Francisco United States Probation Office on March 19, 2015.  ↑ JPMorgan Chase Bureau of Prisons Debit Card Fees Settlement, Top Class Actions (Dec. 27, 2016), https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/consumer-products/360589-jpmorgan-chase-bureau-prisons-debit-card-fees-settlement/.  ↑ There are three types of crimes in the federal criminal justice system: Felonies, Misdemeanors, and Infractions. Felonies are offenses for which a term of imprisonment of more than one year is possible. Misdemeanors are offenses for which a term of imprisonment no greater than one year may be imposed. Finally, Infractions are offenses for which the term of imprisonment may be no longer than five days. See 18 U.S.C. § 3559. ↑ 18 U.S.C. § 3561(c)(1)(3). The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide a recommendation to sentencing judges based on a number of factors, including the seriousness of the instant offense and the defendant’s prior criminal record. Ultimately, this recommendation is reflected in a Guideline Sentencing Range sitting at the intersection of the applicable Offense Level and Criminal History Category. See United States Sentencing Guidelines 2014 Sentencing Table, http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2014/2014sentencing_table.pdf; U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 General Application Principles, http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2014/GLMFull.pdf. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that probation be imposed for at least one year, but no longer than five years, if the Guideline Offense Level is 6 or greater. When the Guideline Offense Level is less than 6, the Guidelines recommend probation be imposed for no greater than three years. See U.S.S.G. § 5B1.2(a), Term of Probation, http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2013/manual-pdf/2013_Guidelines_Manual_Full.pdf. ↑ 18 U.S.C. § 3564(c). ↑ See Federal Defenders of New York, Supervised Release, http://federaldefendersny.org/information-for-client-and-families/supervised-release.html. ↑ 18 U.S.C. § 3564(c). ↑ In 2011, the Sentencing Commission issued a policy statement informing judges that they may let former narcotics abusers from supervised release early, if that person has successfully completed a treatment program.

P. § 32.1(a)(1).  ↑ For example, if you are in custody doing time on a state charge, and that state charge serves as the violation of your SR, the PO can wait until your state sentence is over before brining you to have your PC hearing even though the PO may have filed the violation petition and the warrant issued at the start of the client’s sentence in state prison. A state defendant could be serving a 15-year state sentence such that his 5-year term of SR would have expired by the time he is done with his state time. However, so long as the petition was filed within the supervised release period, then there is an argument to be made that he can still be sent to prison on a federal violation. Perhaps most judges would not do this, but it is a possibility.  ↑ See Fed. R. Crim.

Parole of federal prisoners began after enactment of legislation on June 25, 1910.[1] Under parole, prisoners were eligible for release before their sentences were complete. Parole boards under the United States Parole Commission determined whether a prisoner should be released and whether or not a parolee who violated parole should be sent back to prison. The U.S. Parole Comm’n (USPC, or “Parole Commission”) was just reauthorized for 5 more years, effective beginning November 1, 2013. Despite the abolishment of federal parole in 1987, the USPC currently has jurisdiction over more than 17,800 individuals convicted of felonies under the D.C.

But your complaint should also include other information, both to make your situation clear and to get the judge to sympathize with the problems you face in prison. You should (1) discuss your disability in detail, (2) explain the accommodations you need, and (3) describe the discrimination you have experienced.

If an owner, who is not required by statute to impose a lifetime ban, seeks to impose one, an applicant may object to the policy as contrary to congressional intent as it goes beyond the statutory limits.

Mitigating circumstances might include the fact that the applicant was on the premises but did not manufacture the drugs, or was involved in the manufacturing but was a victim of domestic violence. It may also include the fact that there has been a significant lapse of time between the offense and the application for admission with no other intervening criminal activity. ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 13663(a); 24 C.F.R. §§ 5.100 (definition of federally assisted housing), 5.856 (federally assisted housing in general), 882.518(a)(2) (Section 8 moderate rehabilitation), 960.204(a)(4) (public housing), 982.553(a)(2)(I) (voucher) (2007); Screening and Eviction for Drug Abuse and Other Criminal Activity–Final Rule, H 2002-22 (Oct. 29, 2002), ¶ VI. ↑ See 7 C.F.R. § 3560.154(j) (2007) (RD housing). There are no regulations for LIHTC properties requiring the denial of admission of a registered sex offender. ↑ One could argue that the federal statute barring lifetime registered sex offenders preempts an expansion of that bar to other sex offenders. There are three general types of situations in which preemption may be established. One of the situations is that preemption may be in inferred where the scheme of the federal legislation is so comprehensive that it creates the inference that Congress “left no room” for local regulation in that area. Cal. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 281 (1987). Applying that standard, the area in question is eligibility for federally assisted housing and Congress has fully defined eligibility for federally assisted housing. Imposing an absolute lifetime bar when none is required is determining eligibility in an area that Congress has not left any room for local regulation. Success on such a claim may be complicated as the party seeking preemption has the burden of proof and the presumption is against preemption. Cipollone v. Ligget Group, 505 U.S. 504, 518 (1992). ↑ Corinne A. Carey, No Second Chance: People with Criminal Records Denied Access to Public Housing, 36 U. Tol.

In sum: For certain federally-assisted housing programs, including (1) public housing, (2) the voucher program, and (3) project-based Section 8 housing, there is a mandatory 3-year ban on admission for families, if any member of the applicant’s household has ever been evicted from “federally assisted housing” for drug-related criminal activity. 42 U.S.C. § 13661(a). However, this ban does not apply to LIHTC and RD housing. See PG. 374. This rule also does not apply to applicants who were evicted for drug-related activity from non-federally assisted housing. See PG. 374. ↑ See HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs ¶ 4-8(B)(1) (rev. November 2013) (Prohibited Screening Criteria). Typically this provision is used to prohibit owners from inquiring into an applicant’s medical/physical condition, such as pregnancy, AIDS or TB.

When a conviction is expunged, the judge reopens your case and changes your “guilty” plea or verdict to “not guilty,” and then dismisses the case. The case does not disappear from your record, but it shows up as a dismissal instead of a conviction. Only certain convictions qualify for expungement. Cal.

However, if a PHA, for the voucher program, or an owner, for other programs, adopts a policy that seeks to obtain records from drug treatment facilities, it should also be argued that the public housing statutory protections or their equivalent must be incorporated, as the statute is designed to avoid a violation of fair housing laws and claims of discrimination based upon disability.  ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(t); 24 C.F.R. § 960.205.  ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(t); 24 C.F.R. § 960.205; cf.

The plaintiff filed suit under a section of the penal code that prohibits the use of information from the website for purposes of employment, and the CRA filed a motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute, claiming a constitutional right to provide information from the website to its clients. The court granted the motion, calling the CRA’s conduct protected speech under the First Amendment. The court noted that to fall outside of the anti-SLAPP statute, the defendant’s conduct must be criminal in nature.

There are conflicting interests involved in providing the criminal record to both the applicant and the member of the family subject to the criminal record. The FBI “commented that dissemination of criminal records is limited to those with authorization (such as the PHA) and the person who is the ‘subject’ of the record, not to other persons in the household.” 66 Fed. Reg. 28,776, 28,789 (May 24, 2001). HUD disagreed, contending that under its statutory authority, it is required to provide the information to the applicant or tenant so that the applicant or tenant may dispute the determination. ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(2); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(f); see also 42 U.S.C. §§ 960.204(c), 966.4(l)(5)(iv) (public housing) and 982.553(d) (voucher). The notice and opportunity to contest must also be provided in the case of an eviction or lease enforcement action. ↑ Special Note for Advocates: The statutory language shows a policy concern that PHAs maintain the confidentiality of criminal records obtained through the federally authorized process. However, the regulation states that it is not applicable to public information or to criminal records information obtained from law enforcement agencies if the information was not sought pursuant to the regulations. 24 C.F.R. §§ 5.901(c), 5.905(c)(2). This exemption may be too broad. The meaning and full effect of the exclusion and its consistency with the statute has not been tested. The concern is that this may mean that if a PHA obtains information from a private consumer reports agency, it may not have to abide by the confidentiality provisions of the statute. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681u. Additionally, the confidentiality provisions of the statute most likely do not cover information the PHA or owner obtains from other sources, such as police blotters and newspaper reports. Nevertheless, advocates should argue that any information obtained from law enforcement agencies that is not otherwise publicly available should be subject to the statutory protections. 24 C.F.R. § 5.901(c). With respect to the management of the records, the statute references “any criminal records received,” whereas other provisions of the statute are limited to information received under the subsection. 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q), § 13,663(f); see also 24 C.F.R. § 982.307(b)(2) (PHA may provide voucher landlords information in PHA files). ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(4), (6); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(h). ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(7). ↑ The broad scope of the PHA’s or owner’s liability may provide leverage for an applicant harmed by the negligence. The threat of litigation costs and attorney’s fees may encourage settlement and the admission of the applicant. ↑ 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(7); see also Rivers v. Housing Auth. of Contra Costa Cnty., No. CO5-04291 PJH (N.D. Cal., complaint filed Oct. 21, 2005) (illegal release of juvenile record); There is no equivalent language regarding fees and costs regarding negligent actions with respect to registered sex offenders. ↑ Rent Increases: Basic Information for Tenants, Cal. Dep’t of Consumer Affairs (May 2012), http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/lt-2.shtml. ↑ Studies have shown that a substantial number of public housing residents have family members or significant others with recent criminal history. See Catrina Gouvis Roman, Taking Stock: Housing, Homelessness, And Prison Reentry 24 (2004). It’s likely that members of other federally assisted housing programs are similar. ↑ See PG. 391 for a discussion of the screening criteria relating to individuals with criminal histories. ↑ This includes HUD-assisted housing, Rural Development (RD) project-based programs, and Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties. ↑ 24 C.F.R. §§ 966.4(a)(1)(v), 982.516(c), 982.551(h)(2). Because tenants generally are not aware of the rules set forth in HUD Handbooks, and the lease does not require interim reporting, tenants without notice of the obligation to report should not be penalized for failing to report interim changes in family composition. Compare HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs ¶ 7-10(A)(2) (rev. November 2013) (requiring that all tenants notify the owner when a family member proposes to move a new member into the unit), with HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, App. 4-A the model lease, ¶ 16a (does not require interim reporting of changes in family composition). ↑ In the RD programs, the owner must include a number of policies in the lease with the tenant, which must be approved by the agency. RD regulations require that the lease include information regarding the tenant’s duty to notify the owner of an extended absence. 7 C.F.R. § 3560.156(c)(18)(xiii). ↑ HUD, Public Housing Occupancy Guidebook, ¶ 12.2 (June 2003) (PHA may conduct criminal background check of current residents at the annual review “although this is not a HUD requirement”); cf. HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, ¶¶ 7-4 (A)(7) (rev. November 2013) (owners may conduct criminal background checks at annual recertification). If the owner does require a background check on current tenants at recertification, the HUD rules for project-based HUD-assisted housing state that the owner must conduct the background check on all tenants. See HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs ¶ 7-4(A)(7); cf.

This is a field of law that is very complicated. It is unclear whether you can use § 1983 to make a challenge that a decision lacks substantial evidence, or that the officer did not exercise discretion properly. The state certiorari statute is necessary, especially if your challenge focuses on the failure of the housing program to comply with agency procedures and policies.  ↑ See, e.g., Cal. Civ.

You then had the right to choose between an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge, or a civil lawsuit in court. Starting in 2013, the accusation and administrative hearing option were eliminated, so DFEH must automatically file a civil lawsuit if it finds that you were discriminated against. Cal. Gov’t.

The ADA permits employers to require, as a job qualification, that an individual not “pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.” Moreover, an employer may impose such a requirement even if an employer’s reliance on such a qualification might “screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability.” 42 U.S.C. § 12113(a)-(b). ↑ 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r). The employer must consider factors including: the duration of the risk; the nature and severity of the potential harm; the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and the imminence of the potential harm. ↑ 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r). See also EEOC, EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on the ADA, § 8.7. An employer may not deny employment to someone with a disability “merely because of a slightly increased risk. The risk can only be considered when it poses a significant risk, i.e., high probability of substantial harm; a speculative or remote risk is insufficient.” ↑ See EEOC, EEOC Technical Assistance Manual on the ADA, § 8.7. “An employer cannot prove a ‘high probability’ of substantial harm simply by referring to statistics indicating the likelihood that addicts or alcoholics in general have a specific probability of suffering a relapse. A showing of ‘significant risk of substantial harm’ must be based upon an assessment of the particular individual and his/her history of substance abuse and the specific nature of the job to be performed.” ↑ 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(r). ↑ Cal.

However, if your child is still in high school and lives with a parent, then child support continues until s/he graduates OR turns 19—whichever happens first. Alternatively, child support can end earlier if/when your child (1) gets married, (2) joins the military, (3) is emancipated, or (4) dies. Or child support may continue for longer if (1) the parents agree to a longer arrangement, or (2) the judge orders both parents to keep supporting a disabled adult child. ↑ Cal. Fam.

Proc. § 706.030 (delinquent child support). ↑ The judge is required to make an earning assignment order (also called income withholding or wage garnishment) any time there is an order to pay child support. Cal. Fam. Code § 5230. If you want to make payments directly to the other parent (or caregiver) and NOT through wage assignment, you may be able to work out a different payment arrangement with him/her. If the LCSA is NOT involved in your case, you and the other parent (or caregiver) can agree to make child support payments in some other way, and can ask the judge to “stay” (put on hold) the wage assignment. In this situation, both parents (or caregiver) work out how child support will be paid and handle it between them. If the LCSA is involved in your case, the LCSA will have to agree to have the wage assignment put on hold. This may be difficult, however, because LCSAs usually prefer you to make child support payments through a wage assignment with your employer, and want all child support payments to go through the state payment system (called the State Disbursement Unit), NOT to the other parent directly.

App. 2008); (There are a small number of felonies where the legislature has prescribed a fine as an alternative to state prison. For these crimes, Cal. Penal Code section 18 permits the court to sentence a person to county jail, thus making the conviction a misdemeanor although the legislature in the original writing of the statute, did not permit this alternative. According to the court in People v. Mauch, “By providing for incarceration in the county jail instead of prison, section 18 authorizes a reduction to a misdemeanor for certain felonies even though the Legislature did not provide for misdemeanor treatment in the statutory provisions defining those particular crimes. Because the Legislature has not elsewhere expressly declared any of these particular felonies may qualify as misdemeanors, section 18 creates, to coin a phrase, "stealth wobblers." Section 18's misdemeanor option, however, is limited to felonies the Legislature has specified are punishable by imposition of a fine as an alternative to state prison. People v. Isaia (1989) 206 Cal. App. 3d 1558, 1564. ↑ People v. Moomey, 194 Cal. App. 4th 850, 857 (Ct.

Penal Code § 29800 imposes a lifetime ban on owning or acquiring a firearm for individuals with felony convictions. It also imposes a 10-year firearm ban for certain misdemeanor convictions. If your conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor that does not carry the 10-year ban, your firearm ban will be automatically lifted. If your conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor that carries a 10-year ban, your prohibition will be lifted after the 10-year period. See People v. Gilbreth, 156 Cal.

However, Conley does not eliminate the question for Prop 64.  The Supreme Court in People v. DeHoyos, S228230, is set to decide if Prop 47 can be distinguished from Conley based on a different legislative intent.  The legislative intent of Prop 64 is distinct from both Prop 36 and 47; it is more similar to Prop 47. ↑ Health and Safety Code sections 11361.8(e), (f) ↑ For example, an argument exists that violations of Health and Safety Code sections 11366 and 11366.5 (providing a place for manufacturing, distributing, or giving away of controlled substances) that were based on conduct that now would be legal should be sealed in accordance the intent of Prop 64.  However, Health and Safety Code section 11361.8(e) expressly provides for redesignation and sealing only for Health and Safety Code sections 11357-11360.

Each of these circuit courts decides how the law should be interpreted within that circuit, which the district courts below must follow. This means that there are often discrepancies in the law at the federal circuit level—in other words, the same law can mean different things depending on where you live. These differences persist until the Supreme Court rules on which interpretation is correct. This is the current state of federal expungement law. Several federal circuit courts have ruled that the courts should be allowed to order expungements based on their inherent equitable powers—their duty to make things fair. Others have decided that expungements are beyond the scope of the court’s duties and that they infringe on the powers allocated to the other branches of government. The Supreme Court has not resolved the dispute. See U.S. v. Mitchell, 683 F. Supp. 2d 427 (2010).  ↑ Courts of Appeal in the First, Third, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits, as well as some district courts in the Eleventh Circuit, do not allow expungements based on equitable grounds (i.e. to reward rehabilitation) and will not even hear these motions. See U.S. v. Meyer, 439 F.3d 855 (8th Cir. 2006), U.S. v. Coloian, 480 F.3d 47 (1st Cir. 2007); U.S. v. Sumner, 226 F.3d 1005 (9th Cir. 2000).  ↑ U.S. v.
