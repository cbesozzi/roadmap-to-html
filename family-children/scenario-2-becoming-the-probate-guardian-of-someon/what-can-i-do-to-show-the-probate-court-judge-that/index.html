          <p class="text">It can help to clearly explain the things that make you a positive person in the child’s life. You can emphasize your ability to care for the child, the strength of your relationship with the child, the stability you can bring to the child’s life, and why it is best for the child to live or visit with you. If possible, you should also talk to a lawyer. To find a free legal aid organization in your area, see Appendix A, PG. 981, for places that may be able to help.</p>
          <p class="importantbox"><a id="_Toc308433781"></a><a id="_Toc308701461"></a>IMPORTANT! If you are looking for information on guardianship in juvenile dependency court cases, where Child Protective Services (CPS) is involved, go to PG. 942 These two courts (probate vs. dependency) have different rules for deciding who can become a guardian and how their judges will look at criminal records.</p>
