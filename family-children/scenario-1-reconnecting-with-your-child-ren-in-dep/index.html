<h1>Scenario 1: RECONNECTING WITH YOUR CHILD(REN) in Dependency Court</h1>

<h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc317247526"></a><a id="_Toc448153625"></a><em>Scenario 1: </em>RECONNECTING WITH YOUR CHILD(REN) in Dependency Court</h2>

<h3><a id="_Toc317247527"></a><a id="_Toc448153626"></a>Why would i go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with my child? </h3>

<p class="text">You would go to juvenile dependency court to reconnect with your child or grandchild if CPS is involved in investigating an allegation of child abuse or neglect. As a parent, that could mean your child was taken away from you or the child’s caregiver. You would attend juvenile court proceedings to try and resolve the allegations of abuse and neglect.<sup><a href="#footnote-2375" id="footnote-ref-2375">[2343]</a></sup> </p>

<p class="text">A grandparent could be involved either because the grandparent is accused of abuse or neglect or the grandparent wants to become the child’s guardian while the investigation by CPS continues.<sup><a href="#footnote-2376" id="footnote-ref-2376">[2344]</a></sup></p>
