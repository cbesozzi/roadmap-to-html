  <p>
    How do I find out if I have a learning challenge?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you think you may have a learning challenge, the first step is to get a professional assessment. A qualified professional can determine the source of your difficulty, and work with you to figure out what special learning tools may help you overcome it. Additionally, if you are diagnosed with a learning disability, schools and programs are required by law to give you special treatment to allow for your special learning needs. This is called giving you an “accommodation.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Accommodations can include: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Giving you extra time to take tests;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Letting you use a calculator; OR 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Providing you with reading or writing assistance.[2656] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: Federal law requires that if you do not have a high school diploma or GED, you must try to get one while you are incarcerated. Federal facilities will test you for any learning disabilities that might affect your ability to successfully complete a high school degree program.[2657] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: CDCR does not specifically test for learning disabilities. However, CDCR assumes that you have a learning disability if you get below a certain score on your TABE test (4.0 or below), or if you tell them that you have a learning disability.[2658] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: Generally, if you get an educational assessment, your facility’s staff will review your results and should be able to determine if you might need a learning disability assessment also.[2659] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are formerly incarcerated:

    LEARNING THE EDUCATIONAL LANDSCAPE
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The results of your educational assessment will tell you what educational level you are currently at. Based on that information, you must choose what the right next step is for you. Depending on what your education level is, the next step may be clear, or you may have to decide between several different possible paths. Here are the different types of educational programs you may encounter.
