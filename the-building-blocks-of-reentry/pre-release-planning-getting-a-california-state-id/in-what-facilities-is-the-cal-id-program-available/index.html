          <h1>In what facilities is the CAL-ID program available?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc328831273"></a>In what facilities is the CAL-ID program available?</h3>
          <p class="text">As of July 2015, the CAL-ID program has been expanded to all 36 state prisons in California. HOWEVER, the CAL-ID Program is NOT available at CDCR’s contracted facilities (also called “community correctional facilities”) or CDCR’s conservation camps (also called “fire camps”). This is because CDCR and the DMV do <em>not</em> consider contracted facilities or fire camps to be “state prisons” under the law.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-66" id="footnote-ref-66">[66]</a></sup></sup> This interpretation has not been challenged.</p>
          <p class="text">Thus, the CAL-ID program is not available at fire camps OR contracted facilities, which include:</p>
          <ol class="text">Golden State Modified Community Correctional Facility (GSMCCF), </ol>
          <ol class="text">Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility (DVMCCF), </ol>
          <ol class="text">Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility (CVMCCF), </ol>
          <ol class="text">Shafter Modified Community Correctional Facility (SMCCF), </ol>
          <ol class="text">Taft Modified Community Correctional Facility (TMCCF), </ol>
          <ol class="text">Delano Modified Community Correctional Facility (DMCCF), </ol>
          <ol class="text">Female Community Reentry Facility (FCRF). </ol>
          <p class="text">If your facility is a community correctional facility or a fire camp, then unfortunately you cannot apply for a state ID card through the CAL-ID program while you are incarcerated. You will have to wait to apply for a state ID card after release.</p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">ARE LIFERS ELIGIBLE?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Currently, lifers are NOT eligible to get the Cal-ID, even at facilities that sponsor them. </p>
