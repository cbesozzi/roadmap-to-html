<p><strong>Housing is one of the most important parts of a strong reentry. In the HOUSING CHAPTER, you will learn more about your housing options and legal rights; what kind of housing you can and cannot get into because your criminal record; and things you can do if your legal rights are violated.</strong></p>
<p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

<h3>What are the first steps I should take in my housing search?</h3>
<h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
<ul class="learn-bullets">Some short-term options for housingSome long-term options for housingThe difference between <em>privately run</em> &amp; <em>government-assisted</em> housingRecommendations for finding government-assisted housingRecommendations for finding housing for people with special needs, such as women and children, domestic violence survivors, seniors, veterans, people recovering from addiction, and 290 sex offender registrantsYour rights—and how they are different—if you are applying to privately run vs. government-assisted housing Your rights if you want to move in with friends and familyHow conditions of parole, probation, or other forms of supervision can affect where you can live and who you can live with after releaseHow to challenge denials from housing—whether it’s private or government-assisted—based on your criminal record</ul>
<p class="text"><a id="Housing_options_main"></a><em>Here are the main types of housing you may consider after getting out of prison or jail: </em></p>
<ol class="text">Short-term housing (staying short-term with a family member or friend, staying in transitional housing, staying in a shelter or other emergency housing)Long-term permanent housing (finding an apartment, moving in with family or friends permanently)Special needs housing (which could be short- or long-term)Government-assisted housingBelow we walk through some steps to help you figure out your housing plans.</ol>
<h4 class="step">SHORT-TERM HOUSING PLANS: </h4>
<p class="text">First, you should figure out what type of housing is right for you in the short term, and where you will be allowed to live by probation or parole (or which ever type of supervision you are on) when you first get out. See the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130 to learn about how your rules (called “conditions”) of supervision affect where you can live after release. There is more information about different types of short-term housing beginning on PG. 364.</p>
<h4 class="step">GET YOUR ID. </h4>
<p class="text">Most housing programs will require proof of who you are, your age, and any income you receive. (Go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21, to learn how to get various forms of identification documents.)</p>
<h4 class="step">LONG-TERM HOUSING PLANS </h4>
<p class="text">Later on, you can figure out what type of housing is right for you permanently—we call this “long-term housing.” You need to find housing that you can <em>afford</em>, that you <em>are eligible for</em> (meaning you meet the requirements to be accepted), and that <em>meets your personal needs</em>.Long-term, permanent housing might mean living with family or friends; living in an affordable apartment or housing unit run by a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or a private landlord; or living in an assisted-living facility for people with special needs (like seniors, veterans, women and children, people with disabilities, or people escaping domestic violence, 290 sex offender registrants). There is more information about different types of short-term housing beginning on PG. 364. For more information For more information on housing for special needs, see PG. 366. </p>

<h3>Can I find housing while I am still incarcerated?</h3>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL TIPS<br/>as you look for housing</h4>
<ul class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS as a person with a criminal record <em>before</em> you apply for housing! Depending on who owns and runs the housing (private vs. government-assisted—see PG. 375), you will have different rights in the process.IT’S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO FIND HELP, if you can. Find an attorney, advocate, case manager, friend or family member, or probation/parole officer who can help you find housing. It is very important to have support in this process and throughout reentry. There is a list of helpful community resources in the back of this guide on PG. 1190 if you want ideas about where to look for help.FINDING HOUSING IS TOUGH BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE—be patient and keep looking!SOME OF YOUR OPTIONS. Depending on whether you are currently incarcerated or already out, affordability, eligibility, and whether you are looking for short-term or long-term housing, you will have different types of housing options available to you. As you move further into your reentry, these options are likely to change over time.</ul>
<h4 class="sidebox">STAY POSITIVE!</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Finding housing can be an exhausting process, but don’t give up. Reach out for help. There are resources listed throughout this chapter, and also a list of legal services providers on PG. 1180.Call us at Root &amp; Rebound (510-279-4662) if you have an emergency, and we may be able to refer you someone to help.</p>
<p class="text">Yes, it is possible. First, you may want to think about (1) what you need in the short-term vs. long-term; (2) how your parole or probation (or other type of supervision) affects where you can live; and (3) whether you want to look for private housing, government-assisted housing, or both. To help with this process, read about<em> your housing options</em>, starting on PG. 360.There are additional considerations if you plan to move in with family or friends. You will want to ask them to find out everything possible about the guest policies where they live, and/or about adding someone to their apartment lease. If the housing your family or friend lives in receives <em>any form of government assistance</em>, they may also need to contact their local Public Housing Authority (PHA) to let them know they would like to add you to the household. A list of PHAs in California and their contact information can be found here: APPENDIX A, PG. 442 or online here: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/states/ca.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/states/ca.cfm</a>. Learn more about moving in with family and friends beginning on PG. 417.If you want to find transitional or emergency housing, generally you or a family member, friend or advocate will have to directly write or call the housing facility to ask about what the requirements are. For a list of transitional housing programs that may accept you while you are still incarcerated, see APPENDIX B, PG. 448.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153102"></a>What are some steps I can take if I am worried about becoming homeless?</h3>
<p class="text">An important step to avoid becoming homeless is to begin planning and identifying housing options <em>while you’re still incarcerated</em> (see question above addressing this topic, PG. 361). There are also agencies and nonprofits in the community working to help people find permanent housing and avoid/get out of homelessness. Here are some organizations that may be able to help:</p>
<ol class="text"><em>The Public Housing Authority (PHA) in your area: </em>PHAs sometimes give preference to admitting homeless individuals into the Public Housing program or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers. Visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website to find public housing authorities in your area: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm</a><a id="Emergency_shelters"></a><em>Emergency shelters and assistance: </em>HUD maintains a list of organizations throughout the country that provide emergency shelter and assistance to homeless individuals (visit the following website: <a href="http://nhl.gov/homeless/hmlsagen.cfm">http://nhl.gov/homeless/hmlsagen.cfm</a>) .<em>The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans </em>has an online list of organizations throughout the country that will assist homeless veterans on a variety of issues including housing (visit the following website: <a href="http://www.nchv.org/network.cfm">http://www.nchv.org/network.cfm</a>).<em>The National Coalition for the Homeless </em>has links to databases related to for local service organizations, educating homeless children, transitional housing, drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers, and day shelters (visit the following website: <a href="http://www.nationalhomeless.org/resources/index.html">http://www.nationalhomeless.org/resources/index.html</a>).</ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153103"></a>Will my parole or probation officer help me find somewhere to live?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends, but usually not. But it’s always worth asking your supervising officer if they know of any housing resources!</p>
<h4>If you are on California state parole: </h4>
<p class="text">There is very little help for housing. In some counties, some parole officers may work with local boarding houses, hotels, or motels to find you a temporary place to stay.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1074" id="footnote-ref-1074">[1074]</a></sup></sup></span> Additionally, there could be funding from the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR) for you to stay a short amount of time in transitional housing (most of those programs are run by the CDCR’s Division of Rehabilitative Programs, which you can read more online at: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/what-we-do.html">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/what-we-do.html</a>). You can also ask your correctional counselor (if you’re incarcerated) or your parole officer (if you are living in the community) about what types of funding exists for transitional housing while you are on state parole. If your parole officer is unable to help you find short-term, transitional or emergency housing, you may try going to an emergency shelter (see PG. 362.) As a last resort, you may have to use your Gate Money (read more about Gate Money in the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER on PG. 150) to pay for a hotel or motel, until you find a more permanent living situation. </p>
<h4>If you are on California county-level supervision like probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision: </h4>
<p class="text">Ask your probation/supervising officer about what local programs are available. Ask if they can make referrals to affordable housing agencies or nonprofits that advocate for low-income people to find housing.</p>
<h4>If you are on federal probation, supervised release, or federal parole: </h4>
<p class="text">Ask your federal Probation Officer for a list of affordable housing options in the area. Federal probation officers will not normally release you from a transitional (“halfway”) house unless you have a plan for permanent housing. Also, read about some of your options for long-term housing on PG. 366 of this chapter.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153104"></a>What are my housing options after release? </h3>
<p class="text">Again, there are many different housing options out there—transitional housing programs, emergency shelters, special needs housing, assisted-living housing, living with family or friends, private apartments and houses, and apartments and houses that get government money to make them more affordable for their residents. To make it easier to plan and prepare, we suggest thinking about your housing options in two categories: (1) short-term housing and (2) long-term/ permanent housing. Also, consider whether government-assisted housing makes sense in your situation.</p>

<h4 class="sidebox">What is GOVERNMENT-assisted hOUSING? Why would I be interested in it?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">See PG. 375 to learn more about government assisted housing and the different rules that apply for them.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="text">When you are preparing for release or first get out of prison or jail, most of your housing options will be focused on short-term and transitional housing. Examples of short-term housing include: staying with a family member; staying with a friend; staying in a shelter (shelters usually offer a bed and shower for one or more nights, and sometimes offer other free services); and living in a transitional housing program.</p>

<table><tr><td><p>PROS</p></td><td><p>CONS</p></td></tr><tr><td><ul class="textbox">If you have friends or family in the area, staying short-term with them can be an option for immediate housing.Friends and family can be supportive and useful in helping you successfully reenter the community.A few days or weeks on someone’s couch or in their spare bedroom can give you enough time to go to get social services, start looking for jobs, and arrange for longer term housing.You will likely have greater independence in your life.It will be free or at a lower cost because you are splitting the rent.</ul></td><td><ul class="textbox">If you are under supervision after your release, your housing will need to be approved by your probation/parole officer or supervising agency.Home visits by parole/probation officers, search conditions, and other restrictions don’t just affect you; they also affect your host and other household members. (SEE CHAPTER ON PAROLE &amp; PROBATION, PG. 163)If you are a guest in someone’s home or apartment, your stay could cause the family living there to violate the property’s guest policy if you stay beyond the time limit allowed for guests and/or you violate some other rule in the property’s guest policy (see more on PG. 421).</ul></td></tr></table>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153107"></a>Shelters:</h2>
<p class="text">Most shelters are free, and usually offer a bed and shower for one night or multiple nights, and sometimes services such as counseling and job-search assistance. While transitional and permanent housing options can take time to arrange, you can usually access a shelter immediately. Here are some of the main types of shelters that exist:</p>
<ol class="text"><strong>24-hour Shelters</strong>—24-hour shelters let you to stay at night and during the day and participate in the services the shelter offers (for example: meals, counseling, and job training, just to name a few). Don’t let the name mislead you—a 24-hour shelter doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave after 24 hours: in the Bay Area, for example, many 24-hour shelters have beds available for up to 30-90 days; and other shelters reserve beds for people who are participating in special programs, like a required work-program. The key is that 24-hour shelters are open day and night. Ask the specific shelter you’re interested in about any other requirements or restrictions it has.<strong>12-hour Shelters</strong>—12-hour shelters let you stay for a 12-hour period overnight (usually 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), but require you to leave in the morning.<strong>Day Shelters</strong> let you come and take advantage of their services during the day, but you can’t stay overnight. Services at day shelters may include showers, meals, computer access, and optional programs like case management/support services and counseling sessions.<strong>Family Shelters</strong> have places to stay for you and the rest of your family. They tend to be 24-hour shelters (see the first type of shelter listed above).<strong>Domestic Violence Shelters</strong> take women (usually not men) who are trying to find safety from someone who is abusive. They usually have confidential addresses for the safety of the residents. Many domestic violence shelters also allow women to bring their children with them.</ol>
<h2 class="subheading2"> <a id="Transitional_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153108"></a>Transitional housing programs:</h2>
<p class="text">Transitional housing programs are temporary programs that offer housing and services. Keep in mind they usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. Examples of transitional housing programs include:<em> </em>shared or private apartments, residential programs that allow for temporary stays (from 3 months to 2 years) at no cost or at a low cost, and sober living environments (SLE) (read more about SLEs on PG. 373). Some transitional housing programs also have services like job training, counseling, general education development (“GED”) programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are for people with specific needs such as mental health support, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 373), or safety from domestic violence (see PG. 368). </p>
<a id="_Toc448153109"></a>
<h3>Can I get into a transitional housing program if I am still incarcerated?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">How CAN I show Proof of homelessness</h4>
<p class="sidebox">For proof of homelessness, most housing providers will just need a signed statement. If the housing provider asks for further documentation, you may need to show eviction papers, a letter from a social worker, etc. Some organizations will also issue certificates of homelessness, for example:Coalition on Homelessness<br/>488 Turk Street<br/>San Francisco, CA 94102<br/>Phone: (415) 346-3740<br/><em>Certificates of Homelessness are issued Mondays and Wednesdays 10 a.m.–12 p.m.</em></p>
<p class="answer"><em>It depends on the program. </em>Unfortunately, most transitional housing programs will not let you fill out an application or get on the waitlist before your release. A few let you apply from inside prison or jail, but may have other requirements or restrictions. Go to APPENDIX B on PG. 448 for a partial list of transitional housing options in California that <em>may</em> accept residents who write to them from inside prison or jail.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153110"></a>What may I need to get to be accepted into transitional housing?</h3>
<p class="answer"><em>It depends</em>—each program has different requirements. You might need: identification (learn how to get different types of identification in the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING, beginning on PG. 21); proof of homelessness; proof of any income; proof of your sobriety; police clearance; to get through the waitlist; to have an interview; etc. It’s best to CALL (or if you’re currently incarcerated, ask a family member or friend to call, or WRITE the program a letter with your request) to find out well in advance of when you want to move exactly what you need to do and what the requirements are!</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153111"></a>Special needs housing—short- or long-term</h2>
<p class="text">There are also housing programs for people with specific needs such as sober living environments that offer addiction treatment and recovery, safety from domestic violence, assisted living for people with disabilities or mental health needs, housing programs for women with children, veterans, and 290 sex offender registrants. These are often transitional housing programs that are for a short term only; others are intended to be long-term/permanent housing for people with special needs. For more information on special needs housing, see PG. 366. </p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="Longterm_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153112"></a>Long-term housing overview</h1>
<p class="text">Later in your reentry, often after your stay at a short-term or transitional housing program is coming to a close, you will need to figure out what type of housing is right for you permanently. As you consider long-term and permanent housing options, you need to find housing that you can <em>afford</em>, that you <em>are eligible for</em>, and that <em>meets your needs</em>.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153113"></a>Permanent housing:</h2>
<p class="text">Permanent housing is a place that you can live in for multiple years. Examples of permanent housing include: apartments and homes that get money/assistance the federal government—though these often have long waitlists and require you to have somewhere else to live first; single-room occupancy (SRO) units where you usually have a private bedroom and bathroom, but a shared kitchen and living space; affordable apartments; and living permanently with family, friends, or other people who support you. For general tips for renters, see PG. 432 of this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153114"></a>Special needs housing—short- or long-term</h2>
<p class="text">Again, as mentioned under short-term housing options, there are special housing programs and units for people with specific needs such as addiction treatment and recovery, safety from domestic violence, assisted living for people with disabilities or mental health needs, housing programs for women with children, veterans, and 290 sex offender registrants These are often transitional housing programs that are for a short term only; but others are intended to be a long-term, permanent housing solution for people with special needs. See below for more details. </p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="Special_needs"></a><a id="_Toc448153115"></a>Housing for Special Needs &amp; Populations</h1>
<p class="text">This section provides a brief overview of housing resources for people in reentry with special needs and who might qualify for special programs, including: </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">DID YOU KNOW? </h4>
<p class="sidebox">70-80% of women incarcerated in California prisons are mothers, and the majority were the primary caretakers of their children before going to prison. <em>See</em> Barbara Bloom, <em>The Impact of California’s Parole Policies on Women, Testimony Before the Little Hoover Commission</em> (April 22, 2004).</p>

<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Women"></a><a id="_Toc448153116"></a>Women &amp; Children</h2>
<p class="text">There are some special housing programs available only for women and their children. These programs may have other requirements (for example, that you are currently on supervision, participating in a substance abuse recovery program, etc.), and they may require a referral from CDCR or another agency.Since there aren’t many of these programs and they have limited in space, you should contact the program and/or talk to your correctional counselor as soon as possible about contacting the housing program, finding out if you meet the eligibility requirements to participate, and how to get added to the waitlist if there is one.Below are a few programs in different areas of California for reentering women and children. Please Note: This is not a complete list.</p>
<ol class="text">Centerforce MOMS Program at Santa Rita Jail (in Alameda County, CA):</ol>

<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: starting in a shelter before moving into other housing</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Starting off in an emergency shelter may help you to find transitional or permanent housing and/or access other services afterward. Although many transitional housing programs and social service providers will run background checks and have record-related restrictions, if you are living at a domestic violence shelter, the staff may be able to write a letter or provide a referral to a transitional housing program, which can help explain your situation and get around their restrictions.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Domestic_Violence"></a><a id="_Toc448153117"></a>Domestic Violence Survivors</h2>
<p class="text">If your conviction was related to the domestic violence that you experienced, this is <em>mitigating evidence</em> that helps to explain your criminal record. IF YOU FEEL SAFE DOING SO, you may want to explain the violent situation you were in at the time of your criminal conduct to a housing provider who is considering your criminal record, so that you are not penalized in your application.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1075" id="footnote-ref-1075">[1075]</a></sup></sup></span><strong>Below are a few resources that may help you to find housing:</strong></p>
<h3 class="subheading3">DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS &amp; TRANSITIONAL HOUSING:</h3>
<p class="text">There are more than 100 shelter-based domestic violence programs throughout California. Many of these programs operate both:</p>
<ol class="text">Emergency shelters (typical stay = 30–60 days), ANDTransitional housing programs (typical stay = 6–18 months)</ol>
<p class="text">In addition to providing shelter to survivors, both these programs often provide services such as 24-hour hotlines, legal assistance with restraining orders and child-custody disputes, advocates who can go to court appearances to support you, counseling for you and your children, and referrals to other social services.Most emergency and homeless shelters for survivors do not conduct criminal background checks (although they are permitted to do so, as long as they follow all of the background check rules on PG. 407). In addition, most shelters are aware that survivors often face criminal charges and/or arrest warrants in connection with the violence that they’ve experienced. Many shelters have relationships with local law enforcement, and are able to accommodate survivors who are under supervision (like probation, parole, etc.).</p>
<h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTS &amp; RESOURCES</h4>
<p class="textbox">You should keep in mind that each shelter is different, so the rules and opportunities may not be the same everywhere. There may also be some variation from county to county.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1076" id="footnote-ref-1076">[1076]</a></sup></sup></span> To find a domestic violence shelter or transitional housing program in your area, contact the <strong>National Domestic Violence Hotline</strong> at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or call 211. You will have to contact each shelter or program separately to find out if you met their specific criteria. A list of resources by county in CA for people experiencing DV is also available online at:California Dept. of Public Health: <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/injviosaf/Documents/_California.pdf">http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/injviosaf/Documents/_California.pdf</a> California Partnership to End Domestic Violence: <a href="http://www.cpedv.org/Resources%20A%20K">http://www.cpedv.org/Resources%20A%20K</a> </p>
<h3 class="subheading3">GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">Who does the government consider to be “homeless”?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">The federal government’s definition of “homeless” includes people who are escaping situations of domestic violence and do not have other housing or resources available. This means that if you are escaping domestic violence, you may be eligible for a government-assisted housing program that is for people who are “homeless,” including the programs listed here.</p>
<p class="text">Read an overview of government-assisted housing and why it could be right for you on PG. 375; read details about bans on people with certain convictions and criminal histories on PG. 382.First, the following federal government-assisted housing programs <em>do not</em> have any <em>mandatory</em> criminal record restrictions, and may be available to survivors of domestic violence.</p>
<ol class="text">Supportive Housing Program for the Homeless Shelter Plus Care (for homeless people with disabilities)Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1077" id="footnote-ref-1077">[1077]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<p class="text">Second, for other government-assisted housing programs that <em>do</em> have restrictions based on criminal records, domestic violence survivors are entitled to certain additional protections. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) states that Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) <em>cannot deny or end your housing</em> because of the domestic violence that you experienced or because of a criminal conviction that is directly related to the domestic violence you experienced.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1078" id="footnote-ref-1078">[1078]</a></sup></sup></span> This means if a PHA denies your housing application based on conduct or a past conviction related to the domestic violence you’ve experienced, you should immediately challenge the denial and ask the PHA for an informal review hearing. At that hearing, you can explain how the conduct or conviction is related to your experience of domestic violence.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1079" id="footnote-ref-1079">[1079]</a></sup></sup></span> Go to PG. 389 to learn about the procedure for challenging denials to government-assisted housing.</p>
<h3 class="subheading3">CalWORKS:</h3>
<p class="text">If you are eligible for CalWORKS and you are homeless, you can apply to the Homeless Assistance Program (HAP) through your local county social service agency.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1080" id="footnote-ref-1080">[1080]</a></sup></sup></span> Your family can receive temporary shelter in a hotel or motel for up to 16 consecutive days, financial help to move into permanent housing (such as last month’s rent, security and utility deposits, etc.), and 2 months of back-owed rent to prevent an eviction. Additional services such as counseling referrals are available for domestic violence survivors. For more information on CalWORKS eligibility, go to the PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER, PG. 489.</p>
<h3 class="subheading3">CA’s VICTIM COMPENSATION PROGRAM RELOCATION ASSISTANCE:</h3>
<p class="text">The California Victim Compensation Program (VCP) can provide victims of violent crime—including domestic violence survivors—up to $2,000 per household for relocation expenses, such as first and last month’s rent, security and utility deposits, temporary housing, moving vans, and emergency food and clothing.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1081" id="footnote-ref-1081">[1081]</a></sup></sup></span> Please note that the expenses must be considered <em>necessary for your personal safety or emotional wellbeing</em>, as determined by a law enforcement officer or licensed mental health provider. You will also need to provide verification (a signed letter or other documentation) from a law enforcement agent or mental health provider. You may also have to agree to other restrictions, such as not telling the person who committed the violence about your new location, not allowing him/her on the property, and seeking a restraining order against him/her. </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">A NOTE ABOUT Requesting REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS if you have a disability:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you have a <em>mental, physical, or developmental disability</em>, and you must follow <em>parole, probation, or community supervision conditions </em>that restrict where you can live, you have the right to receive reasonable accommodations for your disability at your residence. To learn how to request an accommodation for your disability from your supervision, go to the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER of this guide, PG. 130. For help, you may also want to contact a legal aid provider for people with disabilities, listed on PG. 1180, or call Root &amp; Rebound (510-279-4662) for a referral or further assistance.</p>
<p class="text">VERY IMPORTANT: The VCP also has certain restrictions on people with criminal records. You may not be eligible if any of the following apply to you:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1082" id="footnote-ref-1082">[1082]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ol class="text">You committed the crime;You <em>knowingly and willingly</em> participated in or were involved in the events leading to the crime, though some exceptions may be considered.You did not cooperate reasonably with law enforcement in apprehending and convicting the person who committed the crime, though some exceptions may be considered.ALSO: If you have been convicted of a <em>felony</em>, you cannot get compensation until you have been released from custody, discharged from probation or parole, and 3 years have passed since the crime occurred. However, <em>you may be able to get your</em> <em>felony reduced to a misdemeanor</em>, which could lessen these restrictions. For more information, see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</ol>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Seniors"></a><a id="_Toc448153118"></a>Seniors/Elders</h2>
<p class="text">Although there are very few housing programs created just for senior citizens in reentry, you may be eligible for housing based on you disability (see PG. 453), your low income (see PG. 375), or qualify for different types of transitional housing (see PG. 365).One program for seniors in reentry is the Senior Ex-Offender Program (SEOP) at the Bayview-Hunters Point Senior Center in San Francisco, CA. It currently provides temporary and transitional housing and is developing a permanent housing facility for the future.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1083" id="footnote-ref-1083">[1083]</a></sup></sup></span> Other transitional housing programs for seniors—particularly low-income housing, homelessness prevention, and sober or residential treatment programs for seniors—may be more likely to admit seniors with criminal records because the conviction was long ago or you have physical or health needs that give you priority for the housing (it may help to mention these factors if the housing provider raises your record as an issue).</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Veterans"></a><a id="_Toc448153119"></a>Veterans</h2>
<p class="text">The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) offers a variety of housing programs for veterans. <span class="emphasisitalic">If you are currently incarcerated</span>—whether in a state or federal facility—a “VA Reentry Specialist” is supposed to arrange a meeting with you about your goals to determine the resources available to best meet your needs after release.</p>
<h5 class="question">What is VA Reentry Specialist and how can I contact one to help me find housing?</h5>
<p class="text">Every region of the U.S. has a VA Reentry Specialist who can help determine your eligibility for VA benefits, help you enroll in the VA, and connect you with local housing and services.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1084" id="footnote-ref-1084">[1084]</a></sup></sup> VA Reentry Specialists have relationships with both state and federal correctional facilities to help incarcerated veterans plan and prepare for release.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1085" id="footnote-ref-1085">[1085]</a></sup></sup>If you already met with the VA Reentry Specialist and received instructions for housing, you should continue with those arrangements. If you are starting from scratch, the VA’s Health Care for Homeless Veteran program can help you find housing in your area. You should visit your local VA, if possible, or call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans hotline available 24/7 at 1-877-4-AID-VET (424-3838). There you will find a VA counselor available to help you.</p>

<p class="textbox">Participating SSVF programs may provide or may contract with local legal aid organizations to provide Veterans with legal services. <em>(Veterans ineligible for VA Enrollment may be eligible to receive SSVF assistance if available. Inquire at your VA if this option is an option for you).</em></p>
<p><strong><em>VA SUPPORTIVE HOUSING (HUD-VASH) PROGRAM –</em></strong></p>
<p class="text">HUD-VASH is a joint effort between HUD (US Department of Housing and Urban Development) and VA to move veterans and their families out of homelessness and into permanent housing. HUD provides Section 8 vouchers to eligible veterans, and the VA offers eligible homeless veterans clinical and supportive services through its health care system. Veterans applying for Section 8 Housing Vouchers through the HUD-VASH program are subject to most Section 8 Housing eligibility rules (for example, your income).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1088" id="footnote-ref-1088">[1088]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="importantbox">THERE IS AN IMPORTANT EXCEPTION TO CRIMINAL RECORD BANS IN GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING FOR VETERANS: HUD-VASH applicants <em>are not subject to most Section 8 regulations regarding criminal and/or drug-related history</em>. This means that Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) cannot deny Section 8 housing to HUD-VASH applicants based off the applicant’s prior drug activity or criminal record (unless you or someone in your household is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration—know as “290 registration” in California—in which case the PHA can still deny you and your household from Section 8 housing programs).<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1089" id="footnote-ref-1089">[1089]</a></sup></sup></strong></span> </p>
<p><strong><em>MENTAL HEALTH RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION AND TREATMENT (MH RRTP) PROGRAMS—</em></strong></p>

<p class="text">If you suffer from past addiction or alcoholism, you may be eligible for special housing and/or funding programs that provide residential treatment for substance abuse. These are also called “Sober Living Environments” (SLEs). More information about funding and these residential facilities can be found on CDCR’s website here: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/substance-abuse-services-coordination-agencies.html">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/rehabilitation/substance-abuse-services-coordination-agencies.html</a>.</p>
<ol class="text"><em>FUNDING:</em> If you are on state parole, you may be eligible for temporary funding through CDCR’s Substance Abuse Service Coordination Agencies (SASCA) funding or another source.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1092" id="footnote-ref-1092">[1092]</a></sup></sup> SASCA funding is generally limited to 6 months of assistance. Ask your state parole officer for more information.<em>SPECIAL HOUSING:</em> There are transitional housing programs that focus on substance abuse treatment and/or sober living conditions for people with former addictions. They may also take SASCA funding. Be aware that many of these programs are only available for short- or medium-term stays. </ol>
<h5 class="question">My conviction was for past drug or alcohol use. Is past addiction considered a legally protected disability?</h5>
<p class="answer">Yes. Past (BUT NOT CURRENT) drug addiction and alcoholism are considered disabilities under state and federal law. This means you may have the right to request <em>reasonable accommodations</em> for your disability.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1093" id="footnote-ref-1093">[1093]</a></sup></sup></span> Reasonable accommodations might include an extended curfew so that you can attend treatment or AA/NA programs, permission to take methadone if prescribed by your doctor, or access to special rehabilitative services. Moreover, a landlord may not deny you housing or discriminate against you based on your past addiction or alcoholism.For more information on housing protections for people with addiction-based disabilities, including what information a landlord CAN and CANNOT ask or consider, the following guide may be helpful: <em>Fair Housing for People with Disabilities</em>, by Mental Health Advocacy Services, Inc., pages 18-20, available online at: <a href="http://www.mhas-la.org/FH%20Manual%20rev.4-07.pdf">http://www.mhas-la.org/FH%20Manual%20rev.4-07.pdf</a>.For more information on asking for reasonable accommodations—where you could ask a landlord to make an exception to their policy banning former addicts from housing (since past addiction is a protected disability), go to Appendix D, PG. 453.</p>

<p class="text">Recently, there have been some important changes in the law governing residency restriction for 290 sex offender registrants. Up until March 2015, as a result of Proposition 83 (“Jessica’s Law”), there were strict residency restrictions on people who were required to register as sex offenders under California Penal Code Section 290. If this law applied to you, you could not reside <em>within 2,000 feet</em> of any school or park where children regularly gather.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1094" id="footnote-ref-1094">[1094]</a></sup></sup></span> In March 2015, the California Supreme Court declared that the blanket residency restriction for all sex offenders required to register under California Penal Code Section 290 is illegal. Now CDCR can place special restrictions on registered sex offenders in the form of discretionary (decided specifically for you) parole conditions. These conditions can require more or less than Jessica’s law, but they must be based on facts surrounding each individual parolee’s case.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1095" id="footnote-ref-1095">[1095]</a></sup></sup></span> The CDCR may also be able to impose other residency restrictions as special conditions of parole in individual cases based on specific case factors.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1096" id="footnote-ref-1096">[1096]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS TO KNOW For people convicted of sex offenses:</h4>

<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153122"></a>Private vs. Government-Assisted Housing: An overview</h1>
<p class="text">It is very important that you understand the difference between private and government-assisted housing, because depending on what type of housing you live in will affect your rights. There are very specific legal requirements for how a government-assisted housing provider can access, look at, and consider your criminal record, and different requirements for what a private landlord can access, look at, and consider. </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE TERMS USED IN THE HOUSING CHAPTER: We use the term “government-assisted” housing throughout this Chapter to refer to housing programs and owners of housing that receive money from the federal government. We do not use “public housing” to talk about any and all housing that gets government money because there is actually a specific program run by the government called the “Public Housing” program. So when we use the term “Public Housing,” we are referring to the specific Public Housing program, NOT all housing that receives government support.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153123"></a>How can I figure out if I am applying to/living in private or government-assisted housing?</h3>
<ol class="text">Did you apply for the housing through a PHA?<em>If yes, the rules and criminal record exclusions that apply to federal government-assisted housing apply to you.</em>Do you have a “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher? <em>If yes, the rules and criminal record exclusions that apply to federal government-assisted housing apply to you.</em>Look up the property online at: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm</a><em>If you still don’t know, ask the OWNER of the property.</em></ol>
<p class="text">Sometimes it’s clear that you live in government-assisted housing because you had to apply for the housing unit or program through a local Public Housing Authority (PHA) or your landlord <em>is the PHA itself</em>. Other times, it’s unclear that you live in government-assisted housing because the owner gets a special benefit directly from the government, and you didn’t know it. The hints above will help you figure out if you are living in government-assisted housing, but you can also ask the owner (the landlord) of the property.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153124"></a>Private Housing</h2>
<p class="text">This is a large category of housing that is owned and run by private landlords (NOT the government). Private housing could be an apartment, house, shelter, month-to-month lease, or year-to-year lease. It could be owned by a single owner or by a large property management company where you only interact with the housing managers and not the owner(s) themselves. …<em>VERSUS…</em></p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Government_Assisted_Housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153125"></a>Government-Assisted Housing</h2>
<p class="text">If you are a low-income person or household and you are looking for affordable rental housing in your area, you may want to apply for government-assisted housing. The federal government funds most government-assisted housing programs. They have many rules about who can and can’t live there, including a lot of rules about how a criminal record affects your ability to live there (read about those rules and exclusions on PG. 379). Government-assisted housing is designed for low-income people.For some government-assisted housing programs, the government runs the housing facilities and EVERYTHING about the housing application process. For other federally assisted housing programs, the government works with private companies or private owners/landlords who run their own facilities and have their own separate application process from the government.Government-assisted housing could be short-term, long-term, an apartment, a house, a shelter, or a transitional housing program with services.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153126"></a>Why would I be interested in living in government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Government-assisted housing is a great option for many low-income people and households. While they have many rules about who can and cannot live there, it provides you with an opportunity to have affordable rental housing in your area. See PG. 376 below for the resources that can help you find government-assisted housing in your area.</p>
<h3><a id="Finding_Gov_Asst_Housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153127"></a>How can I find government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Try the following resources to find government-assisted housing:</p>
<ol class="text">YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY (PHA), which runs some of the biggest government-assisted housing programs, including the Public Housing program and the Housing Choice Voucher program (commonly known as “Section 8” or the voucher program).SEARCH ONLINE: To find your local PHA on the web, visit the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) website at: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/pha/contacts/index.cfm</a>. Once at the website, select your state, then, look for your local PHA by the name of your city or county.SEARCH IN THE PHONE BOOK: If you don’t have a regular access to a computer, look in your phone book in the government or business sections for your local Public Housing Authority (PHA). Some areas have both city and county PHAs; others just have a city PHA. In the government section of the phone book, first look for the city, then look for “housing authority” or “housing department” (for example, the San Francisco Housing Authority, or the Oakland Housing Authority). Sometimes, the local PHA will be listed under the city’s housing department.OTHER GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, NOT THROUGH YOUR LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITY (PHA):PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT LANDLORDS operate other forms of government-assisted rental housing programs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains a searchable list of these programs online here: <a href="http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm">http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/index.cfm</a> LOW INCOME TAX CREDIT HOUSING is an affordable rental housing developed through the Internal Revenue Services’ (IRS) Low Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC). Typically, this housing does not serve extremely low-income households, but it is less expensive than similar private housing in the community. LIHTC housing is owned and operated by private owners and nonprofit agencies and is monitored in each state by a state agency. Frequently, but not always, that agency is the state housing finance agency. Some of these agencies may have lists of persons and organizations that operate LIHTC housing in your state. In CA, it’s the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee that oversees LIHTC. Read more about these types of property at: <a href="http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/tax.asp">http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/tax.asp</a> RURAL HOUSING: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also funds government-assisted rental housing in rural areas throughout the United States and maintains a website that allows you to search for rural government-assisted rental housing here: <a href="http://rdmfhrentals.sc.egov.usda.gov/RDMFHRentals/select_state.jsp">http://rdmfhrentals.sc.egov.usda.gov/RDMFHRentals/select_state.jsp</a> </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153128"></a>Who is my landlord if I live in some type of government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends. If you live in PUBLIC HOUSING, the local Public Housing Authority (PHA)—run by your city or county—owns your entire building and is your landlord. In rare cases, a private company may manage the building for the PHA or may be part of the ownership, but the building is still controlled by the PHA. PHAs operate in almost every city and county in California.If you live in OTHER TYPES OF FEDERAL<strong> </strong>GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, the PHA is <em>not</em><strong> </strong>your landlord. This includes all of the other types of government-assisted housing discussed on PG. 375 above. Even if you applied through the PHA, it will not be your landlord. Instead, your landlord will be a private owner who receives financial assistance from the federal government in exchange for renting to low-income people, or a private owner that accepts vouchers from low-income people who went through a PHA to get a reduction on their rent. Owners of government-assisted housing could be individual landlords, for-profit companies, or nonprofit organizations. You can get this type of government-assisted housing through VOUCHERS, where you get the assistance from a PHA and then have to find rental housing on the private market that will accept your voucher. OR you can get this type of government-assisted housing through “multifamily” properties where the owner gets the assistance and it stays with the property to keep it affordable for low-income tenants. <a id="_ednref1"></a></p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153131"></a>What does it mean to be “eligible” for housing?</h3>
<p class="text">To be eligible for housing means you meet specific criteria so that it is <em>possible</em> for you to be accepted into that housing if you apply. On the other hand, being <em>ineligible</em> for certain types of housing means there is something about you or your situation that automatically disqualifies you and prevents you from being accepted because of housing agency’s rules.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153132"></a>Why is it important to understand the eligibility rules of different types of housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Knowing the rules and policies that different types of housing have for who can and cannot live there is important for you to understand whether or not you will want to apply, and what your chances are of being accepted. If you are <em>eligible</em>, that means you <em>could</em> be accepted into the housing; but if you are <em>ineligible</em>, something about you or your situation automatically disqualifies you from being accepted because of the rules of that housing agency or because of some law that bans you from living there. Keep in mind: it’s possible for your situation to change in a way that could also change your eligibility. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153133"></a>What are some of the reasons I could be eligible or ineligible for a housing program? </h3>
<p class="text">You could be <em>eligible</em> or <em>ineligible</em> because of (1) your income, (2) your criminal record, and/or (3) some other specific factor.<strong>(1) INCOME:</strong> How much money you make will be an important factor for certain types of housing. If you are low-income, it will help you in certain contexts. For example, housing that is subsidized (paid for partially or fully) by the government, you must be low-income—earning less than a certain amount of money per month—to be eligible. The income cutoff is different for different programs (read more below). But for most private housing, you must be earning more than a certain amount of money per month to be eligible. Landlords want proof of your income being a certain amount so they know you are able to pay rent. <strong>(2) CRIMINAL RECORD:</strong> For almost all kinds of housing, specific kinds of criminal convictions may disqualify you from applying, or at least make it harder for you to get accepted as a tenant.<strong>(3) OTHER SPECIFIC FACTORS:</strong> Some housing programs—especially those fully or partially funded by the government—are designed for certain specific groups of people. Your age, income level, disability status, veteran status, homeless status, gender, and whether you have children are just some of the factors that could make you eligible for certain specific housing programs.</p>
<h3><a id="Criminal_record_effect_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153134"></a>How will my criminal record affect my eligibility and application to different types of housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Whether you are looking at short-term/transitional or long-term housing, the impact of your criminal record on your application depends on whether that housing is <em>PRIVATE</em> or <em>GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED. </em>In this Chapter, when we talking about government-assisted housing, we are talking about housing that gets money from the federal government to make it more affordable for low-income people. The federal government has created many laws that control government-assisted housing, including who is allowed to live there. In this Chapter, we will explain how your CRIMINAL RECORD affects your application to both private housing and government-assisted housing; whether or not a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner can refuse to rent to you, what you can do to strengthen your application, and how you can challenge a denial that you believe is illegal.</p>

<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153135"></a>Criminal Record Bans To Be Aware Of Before You Apply to Housing</h1>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153136"></a>1. Criminal Record Bans in Private Housing</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153137"></a>How can my criminal record affect my chances of getting private housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Most private landlords will run a background check on you, and have a broad discretion to deny you based on past criminal involvement. However, the landlord cannot have a blanket ban on ALL people with criminal records and must treat your criminal record the same as it treats other applicants’. Keep reading this section to learn what landlords can and can’t do when getting and considering your criminal history information.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153138"></a>Can a private landlord refuse to rent to me just because of my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Most of the time, yes. Unfortunately, the law does not protect you from housing discrimination based on your criminal record alone. Although federal and state laws make it illegal for private landlords to discriminate against you because of your <em>race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability, marital status, family status, genetic information, and source of income</em> in California, they do not provide any specific or direct protection based on having a criminal record.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1097" id="footnote-ref-1097">[1097]</a></sup></sup></span> Landlords have the power to choose their tenants, and judges often side with landlords who claim that banning people with criminal records is necessary to protect other residents and property.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1098" id="footnote-ref-1098">[1098]</a></sup></sup></span>However, there are some cases where you might be protected if a private landlord rejects you because of your criminal record. </p>
<ol class="text">Currently, the issue of whether private landlords who own buildings with 4 or more apartments can have a policy of refusing to rent to <em>ALL PEOPLE</em> with criminal convictions (these are called “blanket bans”) is being argued in courts. Read more about this on PG. 380.Additionally, if your CONVICTION is for substance/drug abuse, you’re <em>past</em> substance abuse is considered a disability under state and federal law. People with disabilities enjoy greater protection against discrimination (read more about asking for a reasonable accommodation for a disability in Appendix D, PG. 453).Finally, you are protected by state and federal law that limits what a private landlord can learn about you from a BACKGROUND CHECK (often called a “tenant report” when it’s for a landlord who is screening you for their housing). A landlord has to tell you about the background check, give you a chance to fix mistakes, and certain information <em>isn’t legally supposed to come up </em>in the background check (read more on PG. 407). </ol>
<p class="text"><em>Continue reading for more information!</em></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153139"></a>When might I be legally protected from a private landlord discriminating against me due to my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Below are some situations where you might be legally protected if a private landlord is discriminating on the basis of your criminal record:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">What is a “BLANKET BAN” in housing?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Here, a “blanket ban” means there is a policy that COMPLETELY bans or disqualifies someone—with no exceptions for any reason—from housing.</p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack"><a id="Blanket_ban_criminal_record"></a>Blanket Bans:</h5>
<p class="text">While there is no clear current law that the “blanket bans” when private landlords refuse to rent to all people with criminal convictions are unlawful, it is currently being challenged in courts because it creates a larger impact on particular races and ethnicities. Thus, it may be a good idea to consult an attorney.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1099" id="footnote-ref-1099">[1099]</a></sup></sup></span> There are multiple arguments for why a blanket ban could violate the law. These are covered in #2-4 below.If you come across a blanket ban, you should contact an attorney. See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180 of this guide.</p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Arbitrary Discrimination: </h5>
<p class="text">California state law also prohibits “arbitrary discrimination,” (meaning <em>unreasonable</em> discrimination), so if a landlord has a blanket ban against anyone with criminal records—without consideration of your individual situation and ability to be a good tenant—it may be considered unreasonable, arbitrary discrimination, which is illegal.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1100" id="footnote-ref-1100">[1100]</a></sup></sup></span>If you come across a blanket ban, or discrimination that seems completely arbitrary, you should contact a lawyer. See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180 of this guide.</p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Unfair Treatment (also called “discriminatory treatment”): </h5>
<p class="text">Even though a private landlord is legally allowed to consider your criminal record, the landlord must apply the <em>same standards</em> for screening applicants equally. For example, a landlord can’t reject an African-American applicant based on his/her criminal record, but then accept a white applicant with a similar criminal record. Another example is that if a private landlord conducts a background check on you, the landlord must also conduct the same background check on all other applicants. If you come across a private landlord who you believe is treating your criminal record differently from other similar applicants, this may violate your right to equal treatment under federal and state law. You should contact a lawyer. See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180 of this guide.</p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Unfair Impact (also called “disparate impact” or “discriminatory effect”) &amp; Blanket Bans: </h5>
<p class="text">There is a strong argument that banning tenants with criminal records from private housing has a discriminatory effect on African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color, who are overrepresented in our criminal justice system. However, this argument has not been fully tested in court, so it is too early to tell whether it will be successful. Lawyers in New York recently filed a lawsuit against a private landlord, arguing that the company’s blanket ban on all tenants with criminal records violates federal and state law due to its discriminatory effect on people of color, and that the company should instead give special consideration to each applicant’s situation.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1101" id="footnote-ref-1101">[1101]</a></sup></sup></span> There is also a case that is currently being heard by the United States Supreme Court that will decide if this discriminatory effect should be also prohibited.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1102" id="footnote-ref-1102">[1102]</a></sup></sup></span>In addition, California’s fair housing laws may give you slightly stronger protection in this situation, because a blanket ban against all tenants with any criminal records—regardless of the type of conviction, when it occurred, whether it affects your ability to be a good tenant (like pay rent; respect your neighbors and property; etc.), and evidence of your rehabilitation &amp; mitigating circumstances (see PG. 398 for details on evidence of rehabilitation and mitigating circumstances)—has a discriminatory effect and may not be “necessary” to protect other tenants and property.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1103" id="footnote-ref-1103">[1103]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<h5 class="numberboldblack">Past Drug or Alcohol Addiction (A Protected Disability)</h5>
<p class="text">It is illegal for a landlord to deny you housing based on a <em>past</em> drug or alcohol addiction, as this is a protected disability status. Past addiction, as well as current alcoholism,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1104" id="footnote-ref-1104">[1104]</a></sup></sup> are considered disabilities under both federal and state law, so landlords cannot deny you housing for this reason or even ask about past drug or alcohol abuse. Landlords must also provide you with reasonable accommodations if necessary.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1105" id="footnote-ref-1105">[1105]</a></sup></sup></span> However, a landlord may deny you housing if you are <em>currently using or selling</em> illegal drugs (this is the same rule that applies to current drug use in government-assisted housing properties.If a landlord denies you housing due to <em>past </em>drug or alcohol abuse, you should request reasonable accommodations and/or challenge the denial. <em>It is suggested that you try and contact an attorney to help, since every individual’s circumstances and case are different. See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180 of this guide for places that may be able to assist you.</em></p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Bans_Government_Assisted_Housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153140"></a>2. Criminal Record Bans in Government-Assisted Housing</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153141"></a>How can my criminal record affect my chances of getting accepted into government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">When you apply to government-assisted housing through a Public Housing Authority (PHA) (see definition on PG. 359), the PHA runs a criminal background check on:</p>
<ol class="text">You;Everyone currently living with you;Everyone 16 or older who might live with you;Any biological parent of any children who will be living in the household, even parents who do not plan to live with you and are not part of the application to the PHA.</ol>
<p class="text">The rules governing who may be denied are very broad. The PHA tries to exclude people it believes will “risk the health and safety of other tenants.” On the other hand, the PHA may choose to overlook your criminal convictions and accept your application, especially if they see evidence that you have changed since the time of your conviction.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1106" id="footnote-ref-1106">[1106]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! <em>There are a lot of rules about who can and cannot live in government-assisted housing.</em> Every program has its own set of rules that you should be aware of <em>BEFORE you apply</em>. You want to know what laws or program policies might prevent you from living there because of a criminal conviction or other criminal history information, even if your family already lives there. Some bans are required by law, while others are allowed, but not required. These types of bans are up to the discretion and policies of the PHA and/or the owner of the government-assisted housing. You should look at the policies BEFORE YOU APPLY.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153142"></a>Can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) refuse to rent to me just because of my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes, it’s possible. Rules for government-assisted housing can be VERY STRICT. Your local Public Housing Authority (PHA), which runs a lot of the government-assisted housing programs like Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers and the Public Housing program, and works with private owners that accept government assistance to keep their buildings more affordable, may reject you and your household because of certain criminal convictions. There are two reasons that a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing will reject you—the first is when it’s legally required (meaning the PHA and/or the owner of government-assisted housing don’t have a choice and <em>must</em> deny you), and the second is when it’s allowed but not required (meaning the PHA and/or the owner of government-assisted housing has a choice to deny you, but doesn’t <em>have</em> to). It is important for you to understand both situations, and your options to challenge the bans that are allowed, but not required, or spot situations where a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing tells you that the ban is legally required, but there is a legal loophole. Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<h4 class="textbox"><a id="HS_Applying_BansGovt_RequiredVSAllowed"></a>REQUIRED VS. ALLOWED BANS IN<br/>GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING</h4>
<p class="textbox"><strong>(1) BANS THAT ARE REQUIRED:</strong> Sometimes, a government-assisted housing provider MUST deny certain applicants because they have a specific type of conviction on their record. Because the law says that the rejection is required (“mandatory”), PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing do not have a choice in the matter. They must deny you if you have one of the convictions listed in the law. For all conviction-based bans that are legally required, see the chart PG. 384, and the questions on PG. 388.<strong>(2) BANS THAT ARE ALLOWED, BUT NOT REQUIRED (“CATCH-ALL” BANS):</strong> More commonly, you will likely fall into a “catch-all” ban on people with any criminal activity (which includes both arrests and convictions, even if they have been dismissed) that <em>threaten the health, safety, or right of peaceful enjoyment to the government-assisted property by the other residents, the property owner, or the PHA’s staff or agents/contractors</em>. This includes <em>drug-related criminal activity</em> and <em>violent criminal activity</em> (again, both arrests and convictions, even if dismissed, can be considered). Here, the law doesn’t require that you get denied from the housing program, but it allows PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing to deny you on this basis. </p>
<ul class="textbox">See the chart summarizing these bans on PG. 384, and the questions on PG. 388. See Appendix D, PG. 453, for an even more detailed chart explaining which specific criminal convictions make denial mandatory (required by law) and which make denial permissive (allowed, but not required by law), including citations to the specific laws.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1107" id="footnote-ref-1107">[1107]</a></sup></sup></ul>

<h2 class="subheading2">Detailed Questions &amp; Answers About Criminal Record Bans in Government-Assisted Housing</h2>
<h4 class="textbox">WARNING: Read carefully</h4>
<p class="textbox">In the chart above, we summarize 4 situations where a Public Housing Authority (PHA) and the owners of federal government-assisted housing MUST reject you under law based on particular types of convictions. PLEASE NOTE: </p>
<ul class="textbox">These required (“mandatory”) bans apply only to SOME types of federal government-assisted housing, but not ALL types. There are government-assisted housing programs where these bans <em>do not apply</em>.Also, some of these required bans will last for the rest of your life, but others are only temporary bans.Refer back to PG. 383 for an overview of required vs. allowed bans.</ul>
<p class="textbox">SO READ CAREFULLY!<strong> </strong>Don’t assume the ban applies to you. Try to match your exact situation and conviction/criminal record with this chart to see how your criminal record will impact your ability to get into federal government-assisted housing.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="text">Here we explain the information from the chart above in a question &amp; answer format in much more detail. You will learn about the specifics of each of these criminal record bans in government-assisted housing. Later we explain how to challenge denials due to your criminal record, beginning on PG. 425.</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">DO YOU NEED LEGAL HELP? </h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you have legal questions, we suggest calling a housing legal aid provider from the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180, or contact Root &amp; Rebound at 510-279-4662 for further guidance or a referral.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153146"></a>What bans are <em>required</em> in government-assisted housing—for specific types of convictions and specific housing programs?</h3>
<p class="text">Here we explain the four bans that are required (“mandatory”) for SOME types of federal government-assisted housing programs, but not ALL. There might be government-assisted programs where these bans DO NOT APPLY. <em>So please read carefully!</em> </p>
<h3 class="subheading3">BAN 1: Methamphetamine production on federal government-assisted property  Lifetime ban from 3 federal government-assisted housing programs</h3>
<p class="text">Under federal law, PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST PERMANENTLY DENY admission to an entire household to three of the federal government-assisted housing programs—<em>(1) Public Housing, (2) the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and (3) the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program</em>—if ANY MEMBER<em> </em>of the household has ever been convicted for the manufacture or production of methamphetamine ON THE PREMISES of any type of federal government-assisted housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1109" id="footnote-ref-1109">[1109]</a></sup></sup> Because this rule is so specific, the lifetime ban applies to only a <em>very small number of housing applicants.</em>Let’s break it down further. As you apply to a PHA for government-assisted housing, this lifetime ban only applies to you if someone in your household was:</p>
<ol class="text">Convicted (meaning found guilty in a court of law), Of the manufacture or production of Methamphetamine, ANDThe criminal activity took place on the premises (on the property) of any type of federal government-assisted housing.Lastly, if you are applying to a government-assisted housing program that isn’t one of the 3 programs that PHAs run (again, those are Public Housing, the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program), then this mandatory lifetime ban does NOT apply to you or your household.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1110" id="footnote-ref-1110">[1110]</a></sup></sup> Instead, you should look at the catch-all ban on PG. 382 that is allowed, but not required.</ol>
<p class="textbox"><strong>I was denied by the PHA or the owner of government-assisted housing, but based on the information in this legal guide, I think it was a mistake or the required ban doesn’t apply to me. </strong><a id="Challenge_denial_gov_assist_housing"></a><strong>How do I challenge the denial? </strong>If another assisted housing program—not one of the three listed above—tries to impose a lifetime ban on you due to your conviction for the manufacture of production of methamphetamine on the premises of federal government-assisted property, you can challenge the lifetime ban and present mitigating information (meaning facts that are specific to your case and circumstances showing you should not be denied the housing—see PG. 380). </p>
<ul class="textbox">Go to PG. 428 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for an informal review hearing.Go to PG. 398 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information you should include with your application, and as proof of mitigating circumstances &amp; rehabilitation with any challenges you bring.If there was a mistake in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention.</ul>
<p class="textbox"><em>Mistakes could include:</em></p>
<ul class="textbox">Errors in your criminal records (see UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029)Even though you were on the premises of the federal government-assisted housing, you did not actually manufacture the drugs, but you were automatically denied housing anyway; OREven though you were involved in the manufacturing of the methamphetamines, you were a victim of domestic violence that led to your involvement, and you shouldn’t be punished by the PHA. </ul>
<h3 class="subheading3">BAN 2: Sex offense convictions requiring lifetime registration  Lifetime ban for almost all federal government-assisted housing programs</h3>
<p class="text">Under federal law, PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST PERMANENTLY DENY admission to an entire household—to almost all federal government-assisted housing programs—if ANY MEMBER of the applicant household is required to be <em>lifetime registered</em> under any state’s sex offender registration program.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1111" id="footnote-ref-1111">[1111]</a></sup></sup> THIS REQUIRED BAN DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU if you are required to register as a sex offender for a temporary or limited amount of time. Again, the ban only applies if you are required to register as a sex offender in any state for the <em>rest of your life. </em>Unfortunately, PHAs and owners of government-assisted property will often mistakenly apply the ban to anyone registered as a sex offender.</p>
<p class="answer"><strong>EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING PROGRAMS (NO REQUIRED BAN)</strong>: The other exception is that owners of two government-assisted housing programs—Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties and Rural Development (RD) housing—are NOT REQUIRED to deny admission to a lifetime registered sex offender; they have discretion.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1112" id="footnote-ref-1112">[1112]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="textbox"><strong>I was denied by the PHA or the owner of government-assisted housing because I am a registered sex offender, but based on the information in this legal guide, I think it was a mistake or the required ban doesn’t apply to me. How do I challenge the denial?</strong>Some PHAs or owners misinterpret the rules that apply to sex offender registrants, and some apply their own criteria—which in the real world means that the PHA or owner will end up automatically banning a person who <em>shouldn’t be automatically banned</em> (an example of this would be if a PHA had a policy that permanently bans all people required to register on a state’s Sex Offender Registry list, even people who don’t have to register for their entire lifetime).<em> </em>If this is your situation, you can challenge the denial by asking the PHA for an informal review hearing (see PG. 428).Only if you meet the <em>legal definition</em> of a lifetime registered sex offender can you be permanently denied federal government-assisted housing without any other consideration of your individual circumstances. Thus, if you do not have a lifetime sex offender registration requirement, the PHA should analyze the <em>time, nature and circumstances</em> of the offense, as appropriate for any other criminal activity (see PG. 374).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1113" id="footnote-ref-1113">[1113]</a></sup></sup> As an applicant, you should also be allowed to show mitigating information and/or proof of your rehabilitation (see PG. 398 for explanations of what counts as mitigating information and proof of rehabilitation). For example, if you do not have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your lifetime, you should be able to establish that the criminal conduct was not violent, did not involve children, happened a long time ago, and that there have been no problems since the conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1114" id="footnote-ref-1114">[1114]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Go to PG. 428 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for a review hearing.Go to PG. 398 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information and proof of rehabilitation you should include with your application, and/or with any challenges you bring.If there was a MISTAKE in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention. Mistakes could include errors in your criminal records (see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029, which discusses how to fix errors in your record).</ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: There are other restrictions on where people who must register as sex offenders can live under California state law. It is VERY IMPORTANT to check your state and local laws regarding these requirements to know if they apply to you, and how it will affect where you can live. See PG. 374 of this HOUSING CHAPTER and PG. 170 of the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER to understand additional restrictions on where 290 registrants can live in California.</p>
<h3 class="subheading3"><a id="HSG_Fed_Ban_Past_Drug_Activity"></a>BAN 3: Past Eviction for Drug-Related Activity on Federal Government-Assisted Property  Minimum 3-year Ban for Three Federal Government-Assisted Housing Programs</h3>
<p class="text">Under federal law, PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST DENY admission to an entire household to three of the government-assisted housing programs—<em>(1) Public Housing, (2) the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and (3) the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program</em>—if ANY MEMBER<em> </em>of the household has ever been EVICTED from <em>any federal government-assisted housing program or property</em> because of drug-related criminal activity.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1115" id="footnote-ref-1115">[1115]</a></sup></sup> This ban must last for a minimum of 3 years, starting from the date of eviction, but PHAs and owners can choose to extend it.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1116" id="footnote-ref-1116">[1116]</a></sup></sup>PLEASE NOTE: This ban only applies to the three types of federal government-assisted housing mentioned above. It does NOT apply to the following types of government-assisted housing programs:</p>
<ol class="text"><a id="HSG_NoBan_Past_Drugs_LIHTC_RD"></a>Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties and Rural Development (RD) housing;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1117" id="footnote-ref-1117">[1117]</a></sup></sup><a id="HSG_NoBan_Past_Drugs_NoFedAssistanceHsg"></a>Housing applicants who were evicted for drug-related activity from any other type of housing or program that <em>does not receive federal government money</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1118" id="footnote-ref-1118">[1118]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT EXCEPTION TO THE RULE: PHA or owner <em>may</em> admit your household if the person whose drug-related criminal activity led to the eviction <em>later goes on to complete an approved, supervised drug rehabilitation program</em>, OR if your circumstances have changed.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1119" id="footnote-ref-1119">[1119]</a></sup></sup></strong> This is an important exception, because it gives you the power to change your situation!By taking and completing an approved drug rehabilitation program, you could become eligible for housing again, or <em>if your circumstances have changed. </em>“Changed circumstances” could mean:</p>
<ul class="importantbox">The household member with the drug-related conviction has died or is in prison, and won’t return to the household.The applicant household has had no contact for a period of time and does not know the whereabouts of the former household member who was evicted for the drug-related activity.There could be other reasons the family should be allowed back into the housing if the person with the conviction is no longer in the picture or has been rehabilitated.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1120" id="footnote-ref-1120">[1120]</a></sup></sup></strong></ul>
<p class="textbox"><strong>My application was denied by the PHA or the owner of government-assisted housing because of a past eviction from federal government-assisted property for drug-related criminal activity, but I think it was a mistake or that the ban is unreasonably long (more than 3 years). How do I challenge the denial?</strong></p>
<ul class="textbox">You can challenge a denial because the ban is unreasonably long or because there was a mistake in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property relied on. Go to PG. 428 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for an informal review hearing.Go to PG. 398 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information you should include with your application, and as proof of mitigating circumstances &amp; rehabilitation with any challenges you bring.If there was a mistake in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention. Mistakes could include errors in your criminal records (see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1029).</ul>
<p><strong><strong>A NOTE ABOUT CHALLENGING UNREASONABLY LONG BANS FOR PAST DRUG-RELATED ACTIVITY ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED PROPERTY:</strong></strong></p>
<ul class="textbox">If you were convicted of a less serious drug-related crime, such as mere possession, OR you have been rehabilitated (and can show you have changed, done classes, or improved yourself), these are all good reasons to challenge a ban that is significantly longer than 3 years. If you can, talk to a lawyer or advocate!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1121" id="footnote-ref-1121">[1121]</a></sup></sup> See General Guide Appendix A, on PG. 1180 of this guide for a list of legal aid providers in California. A lawyer can explain how to gather proof that shows the housing ban shouldn’t apply to you for more than 3 years. Again, go to PG. 389 to learn about the procedure for challenging a denial, and asking the PHA for an informal review hearing.</ul>
<h3 class="subheading3">BAN 4: Current Illegal Drug Use  Required Ban while Illegal Drug Use is “Current” </h3>
<p class="text">PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST DENY admission to an entire household if ANY MEMBER of the household is <em>currently</em> using illegal drugs.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1122" id="footnote-ref-1122">[1122]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h5 class="question"><strong>QUESTIONS RELATED TO CURRENT DRUG USE:When does drug use or alcohol abuse disqualify me from getting into federal government-assisted housing?</strong></h5>
<div class="textbox9"><em>Current drug use</em> on or near the property by any tenant, household member, person under the tenant’s control, or guest will disqualify you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1123" id="footnote-ref-1123">[1123]</a></sup></sup></span> “Current” means you used illegal drugs “recently enough to justify a reasonable belief” that you’re still using. In their written policies, PHAs and owners should spell out what they define as “recent,” and must abide by that policy. Read more about “recentness” requirements on PG. 455. To learn about how your past addiction could be a protected disability which allows you to ask for a “reasonable accommodation”—which means you can ask the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing to lift or relax this ban (see Appendix D, PG. 453).</div>
<h5 class="question"><strong>How would PHA or owner find out about my alcohol or drug use?</strong></h5>
<div class="textbox9">A PHA or owner could learn about your drug or alcohol use directly from you (in your application) or from access to records about your criminal history or drug treatment. To learn more about how a PHA or owner accesses records related to your alcohol or drug use, read Access to Your Drug/ Alcohol Records for Government-Assisted Housing on PG. 409.</div>
<h5 class="question"><strong>Should I try to hide my current illegal drug use from the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing?</strong></h5>
<div class="textbox9">No, you should be honest on the application. You can be denied the government-assisted housing—or later evicted (kicked out/terminated from the program)—for intentionally lying during the application process. </div>
<h5 class="question"><strong>Do PHAs or owners of government-assisted housing consider whether I have participated in or completed a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program to let me into a housing program?</strong></h5>
<p class="textbox">Generally, they don’t have to, but PHAs and owners may consider that you have participated in or have completed a drug rehabilitation program, and may ask you for documentation that you are not currently using illegal drugs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1124" id="footnote-ref-1124">[1124]</a></sup></sup> Specifically, you may have to provide documentation of your drug rehabilitation with your application if you want to avoid or reduce the 3+ year ban on admitting people who were previously evicted from federally-assisted housing due to a drug-related crime.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1125" id="footnote-ref-1125">[1125]</a></sup></sup> </p>
<h5 class="question"><strong>Can PHAs or owners of government-assisted housing screen me by using or requiring a medical exam or drug test?</strong></h5>
<p class="textbox">No. PHAs and owners may not require you to undergo any type of physical exam or medical testing in order to admit you to a housing program. This includes testing for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (Tb), pregnancy, and, presumably, drug/alcohol screening.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1126" id="footnote-ref-1126">[1126]</a></sup></sup> </p>
<h4 class="textbox"><em>*** IF APPLYING TO GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, <br/>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ANYONE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD TO READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION ***</em></h4>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153147"></a>What bans are allowed, but not legally required in government-assisted housing—the “catch-all” category of<em> </em>bans that apply to *all people with criminal records*?</h3>
<p class="text">For the many of you who do not fall into one of the required (“mandatory”) bans discussed above, it’s more likely you could get denied government-assisted housing because the Public Housing Authority (PHA) or the owner of the government-assisted housing has decided based on your criminal record that you <em>currently</em> “pose a risk to the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the property by other residents, the owner, or the PHA staff or agents/contractors.”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1127" id="footnote-ref-1127">[1127]</a></sup></sup></span>This is a “catch-all” category and allows the PHA or owner of government-assisted property to deny applicants with criminal histories more generally. They are allowed to consider a lot of information, including past convictions (even convictions you had expunged); arrests (even those that never led to a conviction); and in some cases your drug treatment records. See PG. 409 for detailed information about what criminal records a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted property can access about you.</p>
<a id="_Toc448153148"></a>
<h3>How can I find out the criminal record policies of my local Public Housing Authority (PHA) or of the owner of government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="textbox">REMEMBER THAT THESE “CATCH-ALL” BANS ARE NOT REQUIRED: <br/>This “catch-all” category is NOT a required ban. The PHA or owner is allowed to exclude you only if they can show that your criminal history poses a current threat to the health, safety, or peace of other residents, the owner, or PHA staff or agents/contractors. It’s recommended that they consider mitigating information and proof of your rehabilitation—and in the case of the Public Housing program, the PHA MUST consider such additional information!</p>
<p class="text">Each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing will have different rules about what criminal history information they will ignore and what they will consider. By law, the PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST put their policies <em>in writing</em> and make them available to applicants.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1128" id="footnote-ref-1128">[1128]</a></sup></sup> The rules and policies of each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing MUST not violate the legal protections discussed on PG. 409. Furthermore, the PHA must follow its own rules and policies. You may want to consider talking to an advocate/lawyer about whether or not a particular PHA’s policies to exclude people with certain criminal records could be violating the law.

<p class="text">Yes.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1129" id="footnote-ref-1129">[1129]</a></sup></sup></span> A PHA or owner of government-assisted housing may consider expunged convictions in deciding whether to admit you into a government-assisted housing program or unit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1130" id="footnote-ref-1130">[1130]</a></sup></sup></span>This also means that, for this application, when you are asked about any past convictions, you should list even those that have been <em>expunged</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1131" id="footnote-ref-1131">[1131]</a></sup></sup></span> If you lie or don’t include them, the PHA or owner can reject you during the housing application process <em>just for lying </em>OR the PHA or owner could evict you later if it finds out that you intentionally lied during the application.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1132" id="footnote-ref-1132">[1132]</a></sup></sup></span> Remember, The PHA’s or owner’s right to reject you based on your criminal record (including expunged convictions) is limited by federal<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1133" id="footnote-ref-1133">[1133]</a></sup></sup></span> and state law.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1134" id="footnote-ref-1134">[1134]</a></sup></sup></span> Go to PG. 388 to learn more about these protections and limitations on the kinds of denials that PHAs and owners can make.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153150"></a>Under the “catch-all” ban, can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner deny me from government-assisted housing for arrests that did not result in a conviction?</h3>
<p class="text">No.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1135" id="footnote-ref-1135">[1135]</a></sup></sup></span> A PHA or owner of government-assisted housing CANNOT deny, end assistance, or evict you based on <em>arrest records</em> alone.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1136" id="footnote-ref-1136">[1136]</a></sup></sup></span> Some PHAs or owners of government-assisted housing might ask about arrests, and some might not. But whatever the policy, the PHA or owner MUST be able to show that’s it is more probable than not that the <em>conduct underlying the arrest</em> occurred and that such conduct could <em>threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the building by other residents, the owner, or PHA staff or its agents/contractors</em>. This means the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing will need other forms of proof (beyond just the arrest record) that the conduct underlying the arrest occurred, because of course, an arrest is NOT legal proof that you actually committed a crime (unlike a conviction, which shows guilt).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1137" id="footnote-ref-1137">[1137]</a></sup></sup></span>If you were denied government-assisted housing based on arrest records alone (without more proof), you can challenge the denial, as this practice likely violates fair housing and anti-discrimination laws and/or your right to due process.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1138" id="footnote-ref-1138">[1138]</a></sup></sup></span> We suggest that you contact a housing attorney or legal aid organization that can help you (see the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180). Whether or not you can find a lawyer to help you, you should try to get familiar with the procedure for challenging a PHA’s or government-assisted owner’s decision to deny you. For details on this process, see PG. 389.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153151"></a>Under the “catch-all” ban, will my participation in a pre-trial intervention or diversion program matter?</h3>
<p class="text">If the program shows up on your background check as a conviction, then the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing can consider it, and possibly deny you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1139" id="footnote-ref-1139">[1139]</a></sup></sup></span><em> SO it depends on how it comes up on your background check.</em> </p>
<ol class="text">If you are placed into a pre-trial intervention program and <em>you do NOT have to plead guilty in order to participate</em>, then a background check report will probably show the filing of a case, but no conviction while you are participating in the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1140" id="footnote-ref-1140">[1140]</a></sup> If you successfully complete the program, then your case will be dismissed without a conviction ever having been recorded. Therefore, it CANNOT show up as a conviction in a background check, because it never was one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1141" id="footnote-ref-1141">[1141]</a></sup></sup> If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1142" id="footnote-ref-1142">[1142]</a></sup></sup>If instead you are placed in a pre-trial intervention program that <em>requires you to plead guilty</em>, then this guilty plea will probably appear as a conviction on a background check report while you are still participating in the program. If you successfully complete the program, your guilty plea should be automatically withdrawn and those records sealed, after which a private background check company CANNOT report this as a conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1143" id="footnote-ref-1143">[1143]</a></sup></sup> If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1144" id="footnote-ref-1144">[1144]</a></sup></sup></ol>

<h1 class="subheading">Your Rights Against Illegal Denials from Government-Assisted Housing Because of Your Criminal Record</h1>
<h4 class="sidebox">What does “CURRENTLY POSING A THREAT” mean?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you are denied government-assisted housing by a PHA or owner because of criminal activity that DOES NOT threaten anyone’s health, safety, peace, or property, then you have a strong argument to challenge the denial. Go to PG. 389 of this chapter to learn how. Many advocates argue that certain crimes—like prostitution, DUIs, &amp; shoplifting—should not disqualify you because they do not pose any threat to others. The PHA or owner must base his/her decision to deny you on a “reasonable belief” that the criminal activity would<em> threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment</em> of others.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153154"></a>How does the law protect me from being denied government-assisted housing because of my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">The Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing must follow certain laws and rules when considering your past convictions and criminal history information. They may only reject you for criminal activity that <em>threatens the health, safety, or peace of other residents or staff AND the criminal activity must be “reasonably recent.”</em></p>
<ol><li><strong>PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing may only reject you for <em>certain kinds of criminal activity</em>—not everything.</strong></li></ol>
<p class="text">A PHA or owner may only reject you for criminal activity that is:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1147" id="footnote-ref-1147">[1147]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ol class="text"><em>Currently</em> posing a threat to the health, safety or peace of other residents<em>;Currently</em> posing a threat to the health, safety or peace of the owner or local PHA staff or agents/contractors;Drug-related;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1148" id="footnote-ref-1148">[1148]</a></sup></sup><em> </em>ORViolent.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1149" id="footnote-ref-1149">[1149]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<ol><li><strong>PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing may only reject you for criminal activity that is <em>reasonably recent</em>. </strong></li></ol>
<p class="text">A PHA or owner of federal government-assisted housing can only reject you due to criminal activity that is CURRENT or is “REASONABLY RECENT.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1150" id="footnote-ref-1150">[1150]</a></sup></sup>The length of any ban based on criminal records cannot be “unconscionable”—meaning unreasonable and excessive, drastic beyond what’s really needed, or extremely unfair.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1151" id="footnote-ref-1151">[1151]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h5 class="question">What is considered a “reasonably recent period”? </h5>
<p class="answer">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which oversees most federally-funded housing programs (such as Public Housing, the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and others), suggests that “5 years may be reasonable for serious offenses” (like making or dealing drugs)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1152" id="footnote-ref-1152">[1152]</a></sup></sup> and suggests that PHAs and owners should set reasonable time periods for different types of criminal activity in their WRITTEN POLICIES.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1153" id="footnote-ref-1153">[1153]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p class="address">HUD has also suggested that a conviction for illegal drug use that happened 1 year ago could still be considered “recent.”<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1154" id="footnote-ref-1154">[1154]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
<ol><li><strong>If your criminal conviction was the result of a disability (like past substance abuse or mental illness), you can ask for an exception to the criminal record policy (called a “reasonable accommodation”).</strong></li></ol>
<p class="text">If you can prove that your conviction was the result of a disability (which includes past drug addiction and mental illness), then you can ask the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing for an exception from their ban as a “reasonable accommodation” to accommodate your disability and give you equal opportunity to access the housing.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1155" id="footnote-ref-1155">[1155]</a></sup></sup></span> Read more about how to do this in Appendix D, PG. 453.</p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153155"></a>Improving Your Chances Of Getting Into Government-Assisted Housing—Offering Proof Of <a id="Rehabilitation_mitigating_circumstances"></a>Rehabilitation &amp; Mitigating Factors</h1>
<p class="text">This section explains the types of information and evidence that you can show to strengthen your application to a PHA or government-assisted housing. You can also provide this type of information and evidence to challenge a denial from government-assisted housing. (Learn more about challenging denials from government-assisted housing beginning on PG. 425.)</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153156"></a>What is “proof of mitigating factors?”</h3>
<p class="text"><em>“Proof of mitigating factors”</em> is extra information and evidence that explains that the PHA or landlord should not view the offense or conduct as negatively as it might otherwise. You can submit things like:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">WARNING ABOUT what information you share with landlords:</h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you are applying to private housing, be careful not to share any more information than necessary—see PG. 406 to understand what criminal record information a private landlord can access, and see PG. 389 to learn ways you can identify illegal discrimination by private landlords (which has a different legal standard than discrimination by government-assisted housing providers and Public Housing Authorities (PHA).</p>
<ol class="text">A period of time has passed since your conviction or criminal activity (the crime was not very recent);You were convicted at a young age;The nature and extent of your conduct are less involved (like showing you were not as involved in the offense/ conduct as one might think);Physical or emotional abuse, coercion, or untreated abuse or mental illness that led to the conviction (and any of these factors might have led to the crime/offense);Disabilities that you or a family member has that might have led to the conviction; andAny additional context for the conviction (other factors that would help explain the circumstances you were in when the offense occurred and why it should be viewed with more leniency).</ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153157"></a>What is “proof of rehabilitation?”</h3>
<p class="text"><em>Proof of rehabilitation</em> is information and evidence that you have changed and improved since the time of your criminal offense or conduct. You can submit things like:</p>
<ol class="text">Certificates or letters from supervising officers, or court documents showing completion of parole, probation, or other supervision;Letters of support/ recommendations from employers or others (see a list of suggestions for letters of support on PG. 401);Certificates or diplomas for education or training you’ve received;Letters or certificates for completing alcohol/drug treatment programs; andLetters or certificates for completion of rehabilitation programs.</ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153158"></a>Do government-assisted housing programs have to consider mitigating circumstances &amp; evidence of rehabilitation?</h3>
<p class="text">Generally, programs are not required to consider mitigating circumstances and evidence of rehabilitation,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1156" id="footnote-ref-1156">[1156]</a></sup></sup> but they are encouraged to do so.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1157" id="footnote-ref-1157">[1157]</a></sup></sup></span> Only the Public Housing program—run by your local Public Housing Authority (PHA)—MUST consider mitigating circumstances (that is in cases where the PHA has a criminal record ban in place that is not required by law—see PG. 382 for more information on such bans that are <em>allowed</em>, but not required).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1158" id="footnote-ref-1158">[1158]</a></sup></sup> Good news! THIS GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND PRESENT FACTS IN A WAY THAT WILL PUT YOUR RECORD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT—WHICH WILL IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING ACCEPTED.All PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are ENCOURAGED to look at the following (and for the Public Housing program, PHAs <em>must</em> look at the following):<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1159" id="footnote-ref-1159">[1159]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Every application for housing on a case-by-case basis;The seriousness of the offense;The time that has passed since the offense;The effect that denial of admission would have on the rest of your family;The effect that denial of admission would have on the community;The extent to which you have taken responsibility for your actions and taken steps to prevent or mitigate bad conduct in the future;Evidence of rehabilitation;Mitigating circumstances relating to your disability or the disability of any family member; <em>and</em>Evidence of your family’s participation or willingness to participate in social services, reentry support, or counseling programs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1160" id="footnote-ref-1160">[1160]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153159"></a>When could i show proof of mitigating circumstances and rehabilitation to the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">IF YOU PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION UPFRONT, you will likely have a better shot of getting into the government-assisted housing program. Many government-assisted housing programs that are not legally required to ask you for mitigating or rehabilitative evidence won’t… so be proactive!Similarly, if you are TRYING TO REJOIN a government-assisted housing unit, be prepared to explain why you should be accepted, despite your record. Because the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing is likely to run a background check on you, you should be prepared—<em>if asked</em>—to honestly disclose your criminal record <em>AND</em> to demonstrate mitigating circumstances and evidence of your rehabilitation (see PG. 398). Consider giving the PHA or owner additional information about <em>all the benefits</em> of having you join your family and how your joining may <em>positively</em> affect the stability of the entire housing development. <em>These benefits depend on the facts of your specific situation. </em>For example, you might include information about your relationship with the family members currently living in the household, especially a positive relationship with any children or a supportive relationship between you and your spouse. Another example is your potential to increase the income of the family unit already living there, so that you will stabilize the rent paid to the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing. To learn more about joining family and friends—in either private or government-assisted housing—see PG. 417.<em>Continue reading to learn about specific types of evidence that show proof of mitigating circumstances and rehabilitation that strengthen your application to government-assisted housing!</em></p>

<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT TIP AS YOU GATHER HELPFUL EVIDENCE OF YOUR REHABILITATION &amp; MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES: Try to get <em>at least</em> one item from the following list, and as many of these forms of proof as you are able. If you cannot do so, you will have to work very hard—and creatively—at getting other evidence to overcome a criminal record ban or challenge a denial to government-assisted housing.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153161"></a>What specific types of evidence will strengthen my housing application to government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Provide proof of your rehabilitation and mitigating factors as explained above! Letters of support and certificates of successful completion of programs that improved your life are one of the key ways can help strengthen your application to government-assisted housing!Make sure that the letters you get are detailed and really, really positive about you! A weak, impersonal letter is almost as useless as no letter at all. </p>
<p><strong><em>Below are some places you should consider getting letters of support or other documents proving your participation:</em></strong></p>
<h3 class="subheading3">evidence from SCHOOL: </h3>
<p class="text">Show that you stayed in school for at least 6 months and have a positive school record.</p>
<ol class="text">Proof could be in a transcript with good grades, or a letter from a teacher or school administrator.Our suggestion: If school administrators or teachers can say the following things truthfully, these letters should say that you:Were in school for at least six months; Had great attendance and punctuality; Had excellent grades; andAre motivated to learn and get ahead in life.  </ol>
<h3 class="subheading3">evidence from JOB TRAINING programs:</h3>
<p class="text">Show that you stayed in a job-training program for at least 6 months and have a positive record. </p>
<ol class="text">Proof could be through a letter from a program supervisor or administrator. Our suggestion: If true, ask your teacher or the program administrator to say that you:Participated for at least six months;Had great attendance and punctuality;Are motivated to learn and get ahead in life;Have learned useful skills to apply to a job; andGet along well with others. </ol>
<h3 class="subheading3">evidence of EMPLOYMENT: </h3>
<p class="text">Show that you kept a job for at least 6 months and had a positive work record:</p>
<ol class="text">Proof could be a letter from a supervisor or other person at the job. Our suggestion: These letters should not just state how long you have worked. If possible, they should also say:How well you have performed your job;Whether you have been promoted;That you have an excellent attendance record and come to work on time; andThat you are motivated, responsible, and get along well with others.If you worked while you were incarcerated and can get a good letter from a supervisor, do it! This can be useful, especially if you went above and beyond what was required by the job.  </ol>
<h3 class="subheading3">evidence of your participation in COUNSELING OR SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMs:</h3>
<p class="text">Show that you spent at least 6 months in counseling or another social service program to deal with the problem that led you into criminal behavior. If you were in drug treatment or had a drug problem, you might be required to provide a clean drug test. You also have to show that you have done well in the program.</p>
<ol class="text">Proof could be a letter from your counselor, therapist, or doctor.Our suggestion: These letters should do a lot more than simply state the dates you were in treatment and the fact that you completed treatment. If your counselors in social service, mental health, and/or alcohol and drug programs can say the following things truthfully, then they should also say that you:Had great attendance;Had clear drug tests for at least 12 months (and provide the test results);Showed excellent motivation and desire to change;Participated fully in programs;Got along well with others;Understand the causes of your past behaviors and are committed to positive growth;Are not a risk to the safety of others; andNo longer hang out with the same peers that got you into trouble. </ol>
<h3 class="subheading3">PROOF OF a DISABILITY: </h3>
<p class="text">If you have any type of disability that prevents you from going to school or working, then it can help to show any programs you have participated in to get support for your disability. If the disability is a past drug addiction (NOT a current one), alcoholism, or a mental health issue, it could be helpful to show at least six months of counseling, such as mental health treatment or drug or alcohol treatment.Proof of this can be your counselor’s letter explaining that you are unable to work (see above). You can also try to get any other proof of your disability, such as a letter from your doctor, saying that you cannot work or go to school because of your disability. If you are on SSI or SSDI public benefits, you can also provide proof (learn more about SSI on PG. 535, and more about SSDI on PG. 530 in the PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER). If you cannot show at least six months of counseling, work, school, or job training, then you will have a much harder time convincing the PHA to find you eligible. However, if your disability is so severe that you cannot participate in ANY of these activities (for example, you are homebound), a letter explaining this can be helpful. </p>
<h3 class="subheading3">Proof of expungement, dismissal, pardon, or CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION for a past conviction:</h3>
<p><strong>For more information about whether you qualify for some form of expungement (like a dismissal, pardon, or Certificate of Rehabilitation), and how to get these, go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</strong></p>
<h3 class="subheading3">OTHER HELPFUL EVIDENCE:</h3>
<p class="text">While PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are not as persuaded by the following types of evidence, they can still be helpful if the support letters are very detailed, very positive, and make you look like you are doing ALL YOU CAN DO to move your life in a positive direction and be a productive member of society. Consider the following other forms of helpful evidence to include in your application to government-assisted housing (OR at a hearing challenging a denial):</p>
<ol class="text"><strong>Certificates from programs in or after prison</strong>, like anger management and drug or alcohol treatment. Remember that any programs in prison count!<strong>Letter from your Parole or Probation Officer</strong>: Our suggestion—If your Probation or Parole Officer can say the following things truthfully, ask him/her to comment on your:Positive drug tests for at least 12 months;Positive outlook;Compliance with all the requirements of parole or probation; andExceptional motivation.<strong>Letters from clergy</strong>: Our suggestion—These letters are most helpful if they show that you volunteer and play a leadership role in your community.<strong>Letters from landlords or building superintendents</strong>. Our suggestion—Ask them to say that you:Always paid your rent on time;Respected your neighbors; and Treated the property well.<strong>Letters from neighbors</strong>: Our suggestion—They should discuss what a good neighbor you are—for example, that you are quiet, respectful, and/or helpful to the building or community. <strong>Letters from your volunteer work</strong>: Our suggestion—Have you helped out at your children’s school? At their daycare center? Have you been a mentor to a child? Helped a senior citizen? Volunteered in any other way? Get a letter saying that you:Are responsible;Have made a major contribution; and/or Are dedicated to your volunteer work.Also get a letter from anyone you have helped. Have them say what an important role you played for them. Ask the person to be specific!<strong>Letters from people you have helped</strong>: Our suggestion—It can be very moving to read a letter from someone whose life you have touched in a positive way. Have you helped someone through your church? In your neighborhood? Through work?<strong>Proof about your children’s successes</strong>: Our suggestion—If your children have done impressive things, highlight that your parenting had something to do with it. Examples of what you might give are:Letter from your child’s teacher about his/her great work or good grades, emphasizing your role in encouraging your child to do his/her best, making sure your child does his/her homework, etc.Letter from your child’s coach in sports—similar to the letter from a teacher.</ol>
<h5 class="question">What about getting support letters from family? </h5>
<p class="text">While it is always nice to have support from your family, these letters are not as helpful because the PHA and/or owner of government-assisted housing assumes that your family members would write anything to help you get the housing. You can certainly include such letters if you like, but letters from people outside your family will have a bigger impact. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153162"></a>If I can show the Public Housing Authority (PHA) that I really need the housing, will that help my application?</h3>
<p class="text">If you need the housing badly due to a <em>disability</em> or because you are <em>homeless</em>, you should let the PHA know, as those needs might help your application to be processed faster. Beyond these situations, however, information about how you really need the housing or the fact that you can’t afford other housing in the area won’t hurt or help you because it’s usually not enough of a reason to overcome your criminal record. If you’re not sure, you can go ahead and mention the need in the application.</p>
<h4 class="textbox">SPECIAL NOTE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES &amp; SPECIAL NEEDS: </h4>
<p class="text">If the housing unit has unique characteristics that you need, you should request that the unit be kept open while your application is being reviewed, especially if you are challenging a denial of your application. This means that the PHA or owner agrees not to rent the unit to someone else until your application is decided. You wouldn’t want to win the right to live in the unit, just to have it lost to another renter while you challenge the unlawful denial. A PHA or owner will balance such a request with the need to rent vacant units. Go to PG. 373 to learn more about getting into housing if the crime you committed was caused by a disability (like mental illness or past addiction).</p>

<h2>ACCESS TO YOUR criminal RECORDS as you apply for Housing</h2>
<h4 class="textbox">What will I learn?</h4>
<ul class="learn-bullets">What could show up on a background check (also called a “tenant report”) for housingWhat private landlords can and cannot see and consider from a background check/ tenant reportWhat Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and owners of government-assisted housing can and cannot see and consider from a background check/ tenant report</ul>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153164"></a>An Overview of the Types of Criminal Records that Could Show Up as you Apply For Housing</h1>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153165"></a>What criminal records could show up as I apply for any type of housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Here are three major categories of records that might tell a private landlord, Public Housing Authority (PHA), or owner of government-assisted housing something about your criminal history:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">LEARN ABOUT WHEN YOUR Criminal RECORDS CAN BE ACCESSED</h4>
<p class="sidebox">We go into the rules about when these records can be accessed, and what can be considered, beginning on PG. 407.</p>
<ol><li><strong>CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS:</strong></li></ol>
<p class="text">These include: government-produced criminal records; publicly available court records of cases involving you; police and law enforcement records including arrest records; reports produced by private background check and tenant-screening companies (see #2: “BACKGROUND CHECKS/TENANT REPORTS” below); Internet research; the newspaper; and/or information received directly from you—through an application form or by asking you. Learn more about where your criminal records come from in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029.</p>
<ol><li><strong>BACKGROUND CHECKS/ “TENANT REPORTS”: </strong></li></ol>
<p class="text">A private landlord, PHA, or government-assisted owner will MOST LIKELY get a copy of your background check from a private company—and when it’s for a housing provider, the background check report is often called a “tenant report.” Tenant reports show <em>credit information, employment history, certain criminal history information, entries in sex offender registries or other public databases, driving records, interviews with people who know you, and more</em>. These reports are created and provided by private background check companies and/or credit bureaus. (See PG. 407 to better understand the rules about getting background checks, and what information can be considered for housing.)</p>
<ol><li><strong>DRUG OR ALCOHOL TREATMENT RECORDS: </strong></li></ol>
<p class="text">These are documents that show your enrollment in, participation in, and completion of any drug or alcohol treatment programs. In some cases, a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing, <em>may</em> be able to get records about your past drug or alcohol treatment, BUT A REGULAR PRIVATE LANDLORD CANNOT GET THESE RECORDS.<sup><a href="#footnote-1161" id="footnote-ref-1161">[1161]</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a id="HS_IV_RecordsAccess_CreditReportsQ"></a><a id="_Toc448153166"></a>Does this Chapter cover what can and Cannot show up in my credit report?</h3>
<p class="text">No, not really. As a general note, whenever you apply to ANY type of housing—whether you’re applying to private housing (run by a private landlord) OR to government-assisted housing (through a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or directly to an owner of government-assisted housing)—all of these people and agencies CAN access your <em>credit report</em>, which is <em>different</em> from your criminal records, but might be combined in a “tenant report” (which is just a background for housing).<em>Credit reports</em> include information about your past finances and credit history, such as whether you have a history of paying bills on time. Credit reports also show whether past credit problems have ended in a bankruptcy or a court proceeding for failing to pay your rent on time (called an “eviction” or an “unlawful detainer” under law). A credit report shows ONLY credit information, NOT criminal history information. <em>We included some very general rules about credit reports in </em>Appendix F<em>, PG. 461 of this chapter, but these rules are only a summary. This Chapter is focused on how criminal records come up as you apply for housing, not past credit issues.</em></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153167"></a>Can a private landlord, Public Housing Authority (PHA), or owner of government-assisted housing charge me a fee for running a background check/ tenant report on me?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on who is running the background check. Neither PHAs nor owners of federal government-assisted housing can charge you any fees for criminal background checks.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1162" id="footnote-ref-1162">[1162]</a></sup></sup> The rule is different if you are applying for private housing from a private landlord—private landlords <em>can </em>charge you a fee.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153170"></a>How do private landlords learn about my criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">A private landlord can learn about your criminal record from any of the following sources:</p>
<ol class="text">Private background checks (also called “tenant reports”) (<em>see the next question for more information</em>);Publicly available court records of cases involving you;Internet research;The newspaper; and/orInformation received directly from you—through an application form or by asking you. </ol>

<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153171"></a>Your Rights When a Private Landlord Runs a Criminal Background Check</h2>
<p class="text">As an applicant to private housing, you have legal rights related to the information that comes up in a private background check, and how a private landlord may use it. The law protects you by making it illegal for certain types of information to be included in a criminal background check (also called a “tenant report,” or in California, a “consumer report”) on you. But there are a lot of laws that limit what a private background check company creating a tenant report for a landlord can share with them.</p>
<h3><a id="Background_check_rules"></a><a id="_Toc448153172"></a>What must a private landlord do if they want to get a background check/tenant report on me?</h3>
<p class="text">Under state and federal law, you have the right to the following protections if a private landlord runs a background check on you:</p>
<ol class="text">The Landlord Must Give You “Notice” &amp; Get Written Permission to Run a Background Check: This means that you must receive a written document (“notice”) from the landlord saying that s/he wishes to conduct a background check on you. The landlord must get your written permission before getting the background check.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1164" id="footnote-ref-1164">[1164]</a></sup></sup></span>Give the Applicant a Copy of the Background Check: Within 3 days of receiving the background check report, the landlord must provide you with a copy.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1165" id="footnote-ref-1165">[1165]</a></sup></sup></span> In California, you also have the right to request a copy of your report for at least 2 years after the background check company provides your report to the landlord (or anyone else who requests the report).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1166" id="footnote-ref-1166">[1166]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153173"></a>What information cannot be included in a private background check/tenant report in California?</h3>
<p class="text">The following information cannot show up in a private background check report in California:</p>
<ol class="text">Lawsuits or judgments from more than 7 years ago;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1167" id="footnote-ref-1167">[1167]</a></sup></sup> Criminal convictions from more than 7 years ago; Any information about arrests or formal charges from more than 7 years ago;Criminal convictions that have been fully pardoned, dismissed, expunged, eradicated, or sealed under law; Any information about arrests or formal charges that did not result in conviction, no matter how recent (unless your judgment is still pending);<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1168" id="footnote-ref-1168">[1168]</a></sup></sup> Any information about referrals to, or participation in, any pre-trial or post-trial diversion programs (court-mandated programs which function as a form of alternative sentencing);Paid tax liens from more than 7 years ago;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1169" id="footnote-ref-1169">[1169]</a></sup></sup> Accounts placed in collections from more than 7 years ago; Bankruptcies from more than 10 years ago; Evictions actions (“unlawful detainers’) that you won or resolved with a settlement agreement; Any other negative information like repossessions, foreclosures, check verification reports, motor vehicle reports, or drug test results<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1170" id="footnote-ref-1170">[1170]</a></sup></sup> from more than 7 years ago.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1171" id="footnote-ref-1171">[1171]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153174"></a>Do private background check companies have to make sure the information they report to a landlord in a tenant report is true and accurate?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes. Private background check companies (called “Credit Reporting Agencies” in California) CANNOT include “public record” information unless it has been double-checked for accuracy in the past 30 days. Public record information includes arrests, convictions, civil actions, tax liens, and outstanding judgments.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153175"></a>Does a private landlord have to tell me that the criminal record information that showed up in a private background check/tenant report is the reason I am not getting the apartment?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes!<em> </em>The landlord has to tell you if your criminal history is the reason you are not getting the apartment.<em> </em>If there is a negative action taken—like not renting you the apartment—because of a background report, the landlord must follow this 2-step procedure:STEP 1: The landlord must provide you with a copy of the report and a copy of the <em>Federal Trade Commission Summary of Rights</em> before the negative action is taken—giving you an opportunity to clear up any inaccuracies in the report.STEP 2: If the landlord goes forward with the negative action, it must provide you notice about the adverse decision, the contact information of the reporting agency, a statement that the landlord (and not the screening company) made the adverse decision; and your right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of the report.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1172" id="footnote-ref-1172">[1172]</a></sup></sup></span></p>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153177"></a>Can a private landlord ask me about convictions or arrests older than 7 years?</h3>
<p class="text">Generally, yes.*<em> </em>A private landlord can ask you—in writing in an apartment application OR directly in conversation—about past criminal convictions, arrests, and other criminal activity, and you should answer honestly.

<p class="text">Yes. When a landlord collects information in the background check process—like credit reports and criminal background checks/ tenant screening reports, the landlord CANNOT use those reports for any other purpose than the one they originally asked for.

<p class="text">When you apply to PHAs and/or owners of government-assisted housing, they can research you to decide whether you should be accepted or rejected. To do this research, they are allowed to access different kinds of records. There are rules for how they can access and use these records, described below, so keep reading! PLEASE NOTE: There are different rules for how PHAs and owners of federal government-assisted housing can access and use your criminal history records. In sum, the PHA can get more information about your criminal history than an owner of government-assisted housing. We will explain how each gets access to your criminal history information below. </p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153181"></a>Your Rights When a Government-assisted Housing Provider Runs a Criminal Background Check</h2>
<h3 class="subheading3">(1) Public Housing Authorities’ (PHAs) ACCESS TO Your Criminal &amp; Drug Treatment RECORDS:</h3>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153182"></a>What criminal records can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) access, and who gives the PHA my conviction records?</h3>
<p class="text">Most PHAs get criminal history information about you from <span class="emphasisitalic">private background check companies</span> that gather lots of criminal history information from different public sources and put them in one report to the PHA (see more on PG. 407). PHAs can also get your criminal history information directly from ALL OF THE PUBLIC SOURCES listed on PG. 407, such as Internet searches and adult criminal court records! If you apply to a PHA for one of the three major federal government-assisted-housing programs (Public Housing, “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers, and project-based Section 8 Housing), PHAs can ask for criminal records on you from the National Crime Information Center, state and local police departments, and other law enforcement agencies, and it’s required to give them to the PHA.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1175" id="footnote-ref-1175">[1175]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="importantbox">REMEMBER: There is a DIFFERENT RULE FOR OWNERS OF GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING. Owners of federal government-assisted housing CANNOT get your conviction records directly from the National Crime Information Center or law enforcement agencies—but the PHA might share some of this information with them. See the next question below.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153183"></a>Can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) require me to sign a release to get my criminal history information?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes. PHAs can legally require you to SIGN A RELEASE FORM so that they can get this criminal history information for these housing programs.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1176" id="footnote-ref-1176">[1176]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153184"></a>If I am moving into government-assisted housing in a different city or county, can my current Public Housing Authority (PHA) share my criminal history records with the new PHA where I am applying?</h3>
<p class="text">Most likely, yes. Your current PHA is encouraged (but not required) to send criminal background check information about you to the new PHA.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1177" id="footnote-ref-1177">[1177]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153185"></a>Can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) access my drug treatment records, and if so, under what circumstances? </h3>
<p class="text">The law is still unclear for most government-assisted housing programs. The short answer is that a PHA can get limited access to your drug/alcohol treatment records if you are applying to or currently living as a tenant in the Public Housing program (which is a specific type of government-assisted housing program ). There are no similar rules for the other government-assisted housing programs (like “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers or the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1178" id="footnote-ref-1178">[1178]</a></sup></sup> Therefore, unless you are applying to the Public Housing program, it is still unclear if PHAs can legally request or obtain information about you from drug/alcohol treatment facilities. This rule is further explained below.</p>
<h5 class="question">I am an applicant or tenant for the <em>Public Housing program</em>. What information can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) get about me from a drug/alcohol treatment facility?</h5>
<p class="answer">If you are applying to the Public Housing program, the local PHA is allowed to request and get information about you from drug treatment facilities,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1179" id="footnote-ref-1179">[1179]</a></sup></sup> but the PHA is limited to asking only one question relating to your eligibility for the housing, which is:“Does the drug abuse treatment facility have reasonable cause to believe that the household member is currently engaging in illegal drug use?”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1180" id="footnote-ref-1180">[1180]</a></sup></sup> That is the only question that can be asked and the PHA cannot seek any additional information from the drug treatment facility!</p>
<h5 class="question">What is the process that a Public Housing Authority (PHA) must follow when requesting information about me from a drug treatment facility?</h5>
<p class="answer">When requesting information from a drug treatment facility about an applicant or tenant for the public housing program, The PHA <em>must:</em> </p>
<ol class="text">Get your signature on a release form (also called a written consent form) before asking the drug treatment facility about you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1181" id="footnote-ref-1181">[1181]</a></sup></sup> The release automatically expires right after the PHA makes a final decision to approve or deny your application to the government-assisted housing program.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1182" id="footnote-ref-1182">[1182]</a></sup></sup>Have a system to protect your confidentiality (your privacy).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1183" id="footnote-ref-1183">[1183]</a></sup></sup> When a PHA or landlord collects information in credit and tenant screening reports, it cannot use the information it collects for any purpose other than to decide whether or not to admit you into the housing unit. The PHA and owner must keep this information confidential, even when throwing it out.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1184" id="footnote-ref-1184">[1184]</a></sup></sup> Have and follow a nondiscriminatory policy (a document that outlines a policy in regards to discrimination and management practices) that applies equally to anyone applying to public housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1185" id="footnote-ref-1185">[1185]</a></sup></sup> This policy must be written down in the PHA’s official plans and policies. </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153186"></a>What can I do if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) violates my rights in accessing and using my drug treatment information?</h3>
<p class="text">If you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG. 398) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to PG. 389 of this HOUSING CHAPTER to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.</p>
<h3 class="subheading3">(2) GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED OWNERS’ ACCESS TO RECORDS:</h3>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153187"></a>What can owners of federal government-assisted housing see? How do they get my criminal records? </h3>
<p class="text">Most owners of government-assisted housing—just like most private landlords—get your criminal records from background check reports (a.k.a. “tenant reports”) run by private background check companies (a.k.a. “tenant screening” companies), public records and Internet searches, or by asking you directly in your application or interview.</p>
<ol class="text">Unlike PHAs, owners of government-assisted housing CANNOT get records about you directly from the National Crime Information Center, state and local police departments, or other law enforcement agencies. Also, owners of government-assisted housing CANNOT<em> </em>get your criminal records directly from the PHA.<span class="followedhyperlink"> </span>In fact, PHAs are not allowed to disclose information about your criminal conviction history to owners of government-assisted housing.<span class="followedhyperlink"> </span>If an owner wants details about your record, s/he must do his/her own research to get them (with one exception, see side box).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1186" id="footnote-ref-1186">[1186]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<p class="textbox">* THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE: Owners of Project-Based Section 8 housing (which is a government-assisted program where the financial subsidy for the housing <em>stays with the unit</em>, as opposed to the traditional Section 8 voucher that moves around with the person) can ask the PHA about your criminal history information BUT <em>cannot</em> get copies of the actual records from the PHA.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1187" id="footnote-ref-1187">[1187]</a></sup></sup> The PHA may disclose information to the owner only to the extent necessary to help him/her decide whether you can be denied or evicted from the assisted housing unit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1188" id="footnote-ref-1188">[1188]</a></sup></sup> Lastly, if the PHA is screening your criminal history information for an owner of Project-Based Section 8 housing, the PHA must apply the property owner’s own policy, not the PHA’s policy, in making that determination.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1189" id="footnote-ref-1189">[1189]</a></sup></sup> So if the owner doesn’t or can’t consider something, the PHA cannot either. <em>In practice,</em> Most owners of project-based Section 8 housing units are <em>not</em> using PHAs to obtain criminal history information; instead, these owners are using private background check companies to get information on applicants (see PG. 407 for more info on the rules governing tenant reports in California).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1190" id="footnote-ref-1190">[1190]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 class="subheading3">(3) Limits on Both Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) and Owners of Government-Assisted housing:</h3>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153188"></a>Can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing get records of my arrests that didn't lead to convictions? </h3>
<p class="text">No. Under California state law, police and law enforcement agencies, and private background check companies cannot share information about arrests that did not lead to a conviction—unless the charges are still pending. They CAN ONLY report arrests that are <em>pending</em> AND/OR <em>led to a conviction</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1191" id="footnote-ref-1191">[1191]</a></sup></sup></span>Unfortunately, private companies hired to do background checks <em>often</em> report arrests anyway—which is against the law. Because this is such a big problem, there are lawyers working to sue reporting agencies that are illegally reporting arrest records.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1192" id="footnote-ref-1192">[1192]</a></sup></sup></span> When you get a copy of your report, check to make sure there are no arrests on it that did not lead to a conviction. If you see any, you can contact the company and demand that it remove that information immediately! See the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029, for more information about clearing up errors in your record and taking legal action with private companies that break the law.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153189"></a>Can a Public housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing get my juvenile records?</h3>
<p class="text">No.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1193" id="footnote-ref-1193">[1193]</a></sup></sup></span> It’s against the law for police and law enforcement agencies and private background check companies to share your juvenile record with PHAs.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153190"></a>Your Rights When a Government-assisted Housing Provider Runs a Criminal Background Check—The Rules they must follow</h2>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The most common way that most PHAs AND owners of government-assisted housing (as well as private owners) access your criminal history information is by ordering private background check companies to run “tenant screening reports”. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153191"></a>What are tenant screening reports?</h3>
<p class="text">As discussed on PG. 407, a tenant screening report is a background check done by a private company or credit bureau on a housing applicant. It reports credit information, employment history, certain criminal history information, entries on sex offender registers and/or other public databases, driving records, and more. A tenant report may also include information gathered from personal interviews with your neighbors, former landlords, or coworkers.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153192"></a>Who conducts tenant screening checks &amp; provides tenant reports to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) &amp; owners of government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">Many private background check companies provide tenant screening reports, including the 3 national credit bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153193"></a>Do you have to pay for a screening report? If so, how much does a report cost?</h3>
<p class="text">No, not if you are applying to government-assisted housing—neither a PHA nor an owner can charge you to run a criminal background check or “tenant report.”</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153194"></a>What must a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing provide me with if it orders a background check/tenant report from a private background check company?</h3>
<p class="text">California state law requires that you receive information about the background check company <em>within 3 days </em>of when the landlord orders your report.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1194" id="footnote-ref-1194">[1194]</a></sup></sup></span>You also have the right to request a copy of the report from the PHA or landlord for at least 2 years after the report is done.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1195" id="footnote-ref-1195">[1195]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153195"></a>Do I have any rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing rejects my rental application because of a background check/ tenant report?</h3>
<p><strong><em>Yes.</em> The PHA or landlord must give you an “adverse action” notice letting you know it plans to take an action that could harm you based on information that showed up in your tenant report/background check.</strong><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1196" id="footnote-ref-1196">[1196]</a></sup></sup></span><strong> The notice must include the following information:</strong></p>
<ol class="text">The name and contact for the company that supplied the report;A statement that the landlord, not the screening company, made the adverse decision; <em>and</em>Notice of your right to dispute the accuracy of the report and to receive a free copy of your report within 60 days.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1197" id="footnote-ref-1197">[1197]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>

<p class="textbox"><em>ONLY for these two government-assisted programs, PHAs must follow certain extra rules (set forth below). </em></p>
<ul class="textbox">The PHA must make sure the criminal records are true and accurate.</ul>
<p class="textbox">After the PHA has you sign a <em>release</em> of criminal records information and submits that release to the law enforcement agency that holds the criminal records, it may receive a response that there is a match based on your name, date of birth, and social security number. The PHA cannot deny admission based on this information alone; the PHA must verify the match with a positive fingerprint comparison.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1198" id="footnote-ref-1198">[1198]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ul class="textbox">The PHA must give you notice of any proposed action that could harm you.</ul>
<p class="textbox">A PHA must notify the household of any proposed action that could harm you (called an “adverse action” notice). The PHA must also provide a copy of the criminal record information to the person who was the subject of the record—as well as to the applicant, if that’s a different person.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1199" id="footnote-ref-1199">[1199]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ul class="textbox">The PHA must give you an opportunity to challenge the criminal record information. </ul>
<p class="textbox">The person whose information was relied on must be given an opportunity to dispute the proposed negative action.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1200" id="footnote-ref-1200">[1200]</a></sup></sup> NOTE: Even if you don’t have an automatic legal right to a review hearing, you can always ask for one!

<ul class="textbox">The PHA Must Protect the Confidentiality of Your Records:<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1201" id="footnote-ref-1201">[1201]</a></sup></sup></span> </ul>
<p class="textbox">Under federal law, PHAs must have a system to: (1) Protect the confidentiality of applicants’ criminal records; (2) Guard against improper sharing of those records; AND<em> </em>(3) Destroy the records once<em> </em>their purpose has been achieved.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1202" id="footnote-ref-1202">[1202]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3 class="subheading3">your rights against ILLEGAL ACCESS of your criminal RECORDS as you apply for GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING:</h3>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153196"></a>What are my legal rights if a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing illegally accesses or uses my criminal record information?</h3>
<p class="text"><em>THE GENERAL RULE: </em>In general, if you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see PG. 398) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing.

<p><strong><em>SPECIAL RULE for Public Housing &amp; “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher programs:</em></strong></p>
<p class="text">If you applied through a PHA for Public Housing or “Section 8” Housing Choice Vouchers, there is a special rule that says PHAs and owners of the government-assisted housing cannot take any “negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with” the laws and regulations governing access to your criminal records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1203" id="footnote-ref-1203">[1203]</a></sup></sup> A negligent action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing knew or should have known that their access to your records violated the law. A knowing action is one where the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing <em>actually knew</em> that its access to your records violated the law. A PHA or owner MAY BE LIABLE for negligence if they do any of the following:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1204" id="footnote-ref-1204">[1204]</a></sup></sup></p>
<ol class="text">Improperly disclose a criminal record;Improperly use a consent form (a.k.a. a “release” form); Fail to <em>notify you</em> of the criminal history information collected; Fail to <em>provide you</em> with a copy of the information collected (whether you are an applicant or a current tenant); <em>and/or</em>Fail to <em>allow you the right to dispute</em> the information. </ol>
<p class="text">In this situation, it’s best to talk to a lawyer! You could recover attorney’s fees and other litigation costs as part of the relief you get in court.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1205" id="footnote-ref-1205">[1205]</a></sup></sup> See the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1180 to contact an organization that may be able to provide you legal assistance. </p>

<h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153201"></a>Joining Family or Friends in Private Housing</h1>
<p class="text">Here are some general tips if you want to join someone in private housing (meaning neither the family or friends living there nor the landlord who owns the housing receive any government money):</p>
<ol class="text">You can look at the lease/rental agreement and see what it says about the maximum number of occupants/residents and any guest policies (these will usually be in the written lease);You can ask the landlord about guest policies and for permission to add a new person to the lease if that is what you would like to do (sometimes a landlord will say it’s allowed but may be able to increase the rent<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1206" id="footnote-ref-1206">[1206]</a></sup></sup></span>);If the person you are living with OWNS their housing, you don’t have to worry about landlord policies, but you may still want to consider the pros &amp; cons of living with family and friends on PG. 364 above.</ol>

<h3><a id="_Toc448153203"></a>I have a criminal record and want to join a household living in federal government-assisted housing. Can I?</h3>
<p class="text">It depends on your conviction and the requirements of the government-assisted housing program.There is a good chance you will want to join or rejoin a family living in a government-assisted housing unit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1207" id="footnote-ref-1207">[1207]</a></sup></sup></span> Unfortunately, the laws and policies for adding an individual with a criminal record to an existing household can be complex, and sometimes the interests of other family members who are living in the government-assisted housing unit will conflict with your interests in joining them.Here are some COMMON QUESTIONS that often come up, which we will address in this section.</p>
<ol class="text">May I join my family members in their government-assisted housing unit? (PG. 417)Does my family have to tell the PHA or owner that I am joining their assisted household? How do they do that? (PG. 419)Can we challenge a denial if the PHA or owner rejects my application to join the household? How do we do that?

<a id="_Toc448153204"></a>
<h3>I want to join a household living in government-assisted housing. can I?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">FIRST, LEARN ABOUT THE CRIMINAL BANS IN GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING.</h4>
<p class="sidebox">Return to the section above about bans to understand when there are <em>required bans</em> vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing <em>has discretion</em> (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG. 389 of this Chapter.</p>
<p class="text"><em>It depends on your background and on the policies of the PHA or owner. T</em>he same eligibility and exclusion rules apply if you want to <em>join a family living in government-assisted housing </em>as those that would apply if you were applying on your own—see PG. 379. As with new applicants there are a few limited situations<em> </em>in which a PHA or owner <em>must</em> reject the new family member<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1208" id="footnote-ref-1208">[1208]</a></sup></sup></span> (see PG. 384 for bans based on your criminal record). But in the vast majority of situations, the PHA or owner has <em>BROAD DISCRETION</em> to accept or reject you as an additional household member, just like for new applicants. The rules for adding family members to an assisted household are different for every assisted housing program and are determined locally. You should be able to find these rules FOR YOUR PROGRAM. You can look in the following places:</p>
<ol class="text">The PHA’s Annual PlanThe PHA’s Admission and Occupancy Plan (ACOP)The lease for public housingThe Administrative Plan for the Section 8 Voucher programThe lease and/or house rules for all other government-assisted programs<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1209" id="footnote-ref-1209">[1209]</a></sup></sup> The PHA’s website for these plansBy asking the PHA and/or owner for a copy.</ol>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Depending on the type of criminal activity and whether or not if happened on the government-assisted property, it could disqualify not just you, but your entire family from meeting the eligibility requirements of the assisted housing program! (Again, read PG. 378 to better understand eligibility requirements.)</p>
<a id="Report_joining_assisted_household"></a>
<a id="_Toc448153205"></a>
<h3>Does the family in that household have to report the addition to the home? </h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">SPECIAL RULE FOR SECTION 8 VOUCHERS: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">The PHA is actually required to have a written policy in its “Administrative Plan” about temporary absences for anyone in the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, so if you are in that program, there will definitely be a local policy! <br/>24 C.F.R. § 982.54(d)(10). The Voucher program’s temporary absence policy must state whether or when the family may be absent—including for imprisonment; the amount of time you are allowed to be absent for; and how to resume your housing assistance. <br/>24 C.F.R. § 982.312(e).</p>
<p class="text">Yes. In general, if a family is adding an adult member to the household, they (1) must notify the PHA and government-assisted owner AND (2) in most cases, receive the PHA’s and government-assisted owner’s approval for the new addition to the household.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1210" id="footnote-ref-1210">[1210]</a></sup></sup></span> Ask the PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing what the rules are for reporting a new member, and what the timeframe is for when you have to report a change to who is living in your household. It is very important to follow all of their rules!</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153206"></a><a id="Rejoin_assist_household"></a>I want to return back to my government-assisted housing unit after a brief period of incarceration. can I do that? </h3>
<p class="text">It depends on the program. And it depends on the criminal activity.As always, anyone joining or returning to government-assisted housing MUST meet ALL of the eligibility requirements for that housing program, for that PHA, and for the owner (if there is one). For exclusions (bans) based on your criminal record, read PG. 384 of this chapter to understand when there are <em>required bans</em> vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing <em>has discretion</em> (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on PG. 389 of this Chapter.<em>For most federal government-assisted housing programs</em>, the local PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing may develop rules and policies regarding temporary absences, and many do have such policies. You need to check with the PHA and owner that oversee the housing unit you want to join about their policies.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1211" id="footnote-ref-1211">[1211]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Since your return could harm the entire family’s ability to stay in government-assisted housing, it’s a good idea for the family to discuss these issues with the PHA and/or owner of the government-assisted housing BEFORE you return from your brief absence. If that is not possible, there are legal defenses to an eviction action if it is brought against the entire family in court. This HOUSING CHAPTER does not cover eviction law and all of its defenses, so if this is your issue, you will need to contact a legal aid organization that specializes in eviction defense. Go to PG. 1180 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help.</p>
<a id="_Toc448153207"></a>
<h3>If I am joining a household, will the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing run a criminal background check on me?</h3>
<h4 class="sidebox">fdv Why do these rules about joinging households exist?</h4>
<p class="sidebox">These policies exist because PHAs and owners have an interest in knowing who is living in their units. They may want to review current information to assess how you may act as a tenant, whether you will obey the lease, and whether you pose a threat to other residents, the housing development, or their staff. The PHA or owner may also need to know who is residing in the unit to calculate the amount of rent owed and/or to determine the correct family size for the specific unit.</p>
<p class="text">Most likely, yes. Most government-assisted housing programs, will check the members of a family every year, and some programs will require mid-year reporting as well. This process is called <em>recertification</em>. When the recertification process is happening, the PHA or owner will be checking all new household members to make sure they meet <em>all of the eligibility criteria for move-in! </em>Most PHAs and owners will check the criminal background of any NEW family members at this time. <em>They could</em> re-check the criminal background of current tenants at this time, but it’s unlikely.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1212" id="footnote-ref-1212">[1212]</a></sup></sup></span> The criminal background check on any tenant could lead to the PHA or owner threatening to evict or end the assistance to an entire household.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1213" id="footnote-ref-1213">[1213]</a></sup></sup></span> Again, this HOUSING CHAPTER does not go into eviction defense, but see PG. 1180 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help you if you are facing an eviction.</p>
<p><strong><em>BE PREPARED TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU SHOULD BE ACCEPTED INTO HOUSING, DESPITE YOUR RECORD.</em></strong></p>
<p class="text">Because the PHA or owner is likely to run a criminal background check on you, you should be prepared—<em>if asked</em>—to honestly disclose your criminal record <em>and</em> to demonstrate mitigating circumstances and evidence of your rehabilitation (see PG. 398). Consider giving the PHA or owner additional information about <em>all the benefits</em> of having you join the family and how your joining may <em>positively</em> affect the stability of the entire housing development. <em>These benefits depend on the facts of your specific situation. </em>For example, you might include information about your relationship with the family members currently living in the household, especially a positive relationship with any children or a supportive relationship between you and your spouse. Another example is your potential for increasing the income of the family members that are already living in the assisted housing unit, and therefore stabilizing the rent paid to the PHA or owner.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153208"></a>If I am being incarcerated for a new offense, does my family have to report that I moved out?</h3>
<p class="text">Generally, yes.<em> </em>PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing usually have policies that require family members to report when a family member moves out.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1214" id="footnote-ref-1214">[1214]</a></sup></sup></span> The family’s duty to report an absence generally depends on whether your absence is temporary, and whether you intend to continue to reside in the unit after your return. Whether or not you have to re-apply will depend on how long you are gone. Many PHAs consider you to have <em>permanently moved out</em> if you’re absent from the rental unit for <em>30 or more consecutive days</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1215" id="footnote-ref-1215">[1215]</a></sup></sup></span> Keep in mind that depending on the terms of your lease/rental agreement, the PHA may be able to evict your family for failing to report any changes in the number of people living there (called “occupants”). Therefore, even if your absence is temporary (for example, less than 30 days), your family should <em>still report</em> that you’ve temporarily moved out to the PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing unit, to avoid breaking any rules in the lease. There is a chance that if it’s just a short, temporary absence, it won’t change your family’s ability to stay in the government-assisted housing unit. BUT if know you are going to be absent from the unit for 30 or more days, then your family should declare you permanently absent, meaning that you have permanently moved out.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1216" id="footnote-ref-1216">[1216]</a></sup></sup></span> If, after your incarceration, you intend to return to the unit, you will have to re-apply and meet ALL of the eligibility requirements (see PG. 379 to understand how your criminal record could affect your being re-admitted to federal government-assisted housing). </p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Guest_policies"></a><a id="_Toc448153209"></a>Guest Policies in Government-Assisted Housing:</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153210"></a>I have a record and want to temporarily visit or stay overnight as a guest with my family in their government-assisted housing unit. Will my visit in any way risk my family’s government assistance?</h3>
<p class="text">Unfortunately, it could—depending on the policies of the PHA or owner. Below we explain the general rules for staying with family or friends as a guest in their government-assisted housing, and suggested steps to avoid putting their housing assistance at risk.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153211"></a>I have a record and want to temporarily visit or stay overnight as a guest with my family in their government-assisted housing unit. What are some suggested steps I can take to avoid putting my family or friend’s housing assistance at risk?</h3>
<p><strong><em>(1) If you are planning to stay for only 1 night as a guest:</em></strong></p>
<p class="text">As a general rule, people living in government-assisted housing <em>are allowed</em> to have overnight guests. For federal government-assisted housing, federal regulations define the term “guest” as “a person temporarily staying in the unit with the consent of a tenant.”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1217" id="footnote-ref-1217">[1217]</a></sup></sup></span>The person living in the government-assisted housing unit should not be required to register and seek prior approval for an overnight guest. The owner of the government-assisted housing should allow the tenant to host guests for a “reasonable” amount of time,<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1218" id="footnote-ref-1218">[1218]</a></sup></sup></span> which is usually 14 to 30 days, depending on the landlord’s policy.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1219" id="footnote-ref-1219">[1219]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<p class="importantbox">WARNING: There might be circumstances where an individual CANNOT stay as a guest or visit the assisted property AT ALL. For example, if someone committed a criminal offense on the property, the PHA and owner of the government-assisted housing may be legally allowed to ban that person from ever returning to the property. There could also be a restriction on a person’s parole or probation that forbids them from being on the property. For this reason, you want to be careful to know the rules of that PHA or owner AND know your rules of probation or parole.</p>
<p><strong><em>(2) If you are planning to stay for longer than 1 night as a guest:</em></strong></p>
<p class="text">You want to be careful to know the rules of that PHA or owner about “Unauthorized Occupants.” There are situations where, instead of being seen as a “guest”—even if that’s what you and your family consider you to truly be—the PHA or owner might classify you as an “unauthorized occupant,” a resident living in that housing unit without permission of the PHA or owner and against the rules. Being seen as an unauthorized occupant is a big problem for many reasons:</p>
<ol class="text">Your income and/or assets (for example, any savings or major property you own) could affect the amount of rental assistance that your family receives. The total income might be too high for the family to qualify for any assistance at all. This could lead to your family being evicted from the unit or losing its financial assistance for the housing unit.Just by being in the apartment, you might be violating the lease or the owner’s or PHA’s guest policies and subject your family to eviction.</ol>
<p class="text">If you want to stay as a guest for a longer period, you need to know the PHA or owner’s time limit on the number of back-to-back days OR number of total days in a year that a guest may stay in the government-assisted housing unit and still be considered a “guest.” </p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! Again, find out the PHA’s and owner’s rules and do not break them. Check the lease and the PHA’s and owner’s policies. There is usually a period of time stated in the lease and/or in the PHA’s or owner’s policies that defines when a guest becomes an “unauthorized occupant.”</p>
<h4 class="textbox">* Special Guest Policy Rules for Specific Government-Assisted Housing Programs:<br/><em>Section 8 Vouchers and Rural Development Housing</em></h4>
<p class="textbox"><em>Section 8 Vouchers programs:</em> Some PHAs have established guest policies for Section 8 voucher participants, limiting the time period that persons not listed as household members can stay with a tenant.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1220" id="footnote-ref-1220">[1220]</a></sup></sup></span> PHAs should inform participants of these policies and give them an opportunity to request that anyone living there for a longer period be added to the household.<em>Rural Development (RD) programs:</em> Federal regulations require that all RD leases “include provisions that establish when a guest will be considered a member of the household and be required to be added to the tenant certification.”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1221" id="footnote-ref-1221">[1221]</a></sup></sup></span> Also, the owner of the property must post this same information in its occupancy rules.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1222" id="footnote-ref-1222">[1222]</a></sup></sup></span> That means that although there is no standard amount of time required by law, the owner still <em>must</em> <em>include</em> its guest policies in the agency-approved lease used with tenants. As with the other programs, preapproval and registration of guests should not be required and the amount of time that a tenant may have a guest should be a reasonable period. However, if the guest was a former tenant who committed a drug violation and was evicted, then the owner may require that the tenant obtain approval before the guest may visit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1223" id="footnote-ref-1223">[1223]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153212"></a>If I am planning to stay as a guest with family or friends until I am added to their housing lease, what are some suggested steps I can take to make sure we are following all the guest policies?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes, you can try to negotiate with the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property.For example, if your family is seeking to add you to the lease—but the screening process to add you to the lease <em>TAKES LONGER</em> than the amount of time the family is allowed to have you as a guest—your family, or an advocate working on your behalf, may be able to negotiate with the housing provider at the start to extend the period of time that you are allowed to stay as a guest in that government-assisted household.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1224" id="footnote-ref-1224">[1224]</a></sup></sup></span> If your family can negotiate a policy that allows you to stay longer as their guest, this helps avoid problems later on if the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing accuses your family of exceeding the time limits for guests, in violation of their lease agreement.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153213"></a>If a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing denies my request to be added to my family or friend’s lease, who can challenge the denial And how?</h3>
<p class="text">Your family member (whomever is listed on the lease) can request a REVIEW HEARING (sometimes call a grievance hearing, informal review, informal hearing, or conference)! Go to PG. 389 to learn about how to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing and request a review hearing.</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Livein_aid_policies"></a><a id="_Toc448153214"></a>Live-in Aide Policies in Government-Assisted Housing</h2>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153215"></a>What is a “live-in aide?”</h3>
<p class="text">A live-in aide is a person who <em>resides with</em> one or more elderly, near elderly, or disabled persons, and who is <em>essential to the care</em> and well-being of that individual. The live-in aide is not obligated to support the person and would not be living in the unit except to provide the required services.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1225" id="footnote-ref-1225">[1225]</a></sup></sup></span>A live-in aide is NOT a household member. If you are a live-in aide, your income will be <em>excluded</em> from calculating the rent for the assisted unit. However, the family that lives in the unit could request an extra bedroom for the live-in aide and then be required to pay the standard amount for the larger bedroom size.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153216"></a>Can I be someone’s live-in aide in government-assisted housing if I have criminal record?</h3>
<p class="text">Maybe. If you have a criminal record, you may be able to reside in a government-assisted housing unit as a <em>live-in aide</em>, but you will need to be screened (see next question).Depending on the policies of the PHA or owner, the criminal background check conducted for a live-in aide may be less strict than the one used for admitting a new tenant because a live-in aide is <em>not</em> considered a true household member.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153217"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my criminal background if I am someone’s live-in aide?</h3>
<p class="text">Yes. The PHA and owner can screen you for issues related to your being present in the assisted unit. Most PHAs and owners will screen live-in aides for their criminal background <em>using the same or similar criteria</em> as they use for admissions (read PG. 384 for the criminal record-related bans in federal government-housing, including which ones are <em>required</em> versus which ones are <em>allowed</em>).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1226" id="footnote-ref-1226">[1226]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153218"></a>Will the PHA or owner screen me for my credit history if I am someone’s live-in aide?</h3>
<p class="text">No. The <em>PHA or owner should not screen you for your credit history if you are a live-in aide. </em>Your credit history has nothing to do with the family’s ability to pay for the unit—so you should not be screened for credit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1227" id="footnote-ref-1227">[1227]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153219"></a>I was excluded from being someone’s live-in aide based on my criminal record. What can I do? </h3>
<p class="text">THE <em>PERSON REQUIRING AID</em> SHOULD ASK FOR A REVIEW HEARING. Go to PG. 389 to learn how (s)he can challenge this denial of you as his/her live-in aide.There may be situations in which the disabled/elderly resident needing the care has great difficulty finding a live-in aide, or that you meet some unique need of that individual requiring care. In such situations, the disabled/elderly individual needing the live-in aide may request a <em>reasonable accommodation</em> for a disability by asking the PHA or owner <em>to waive its strict screening criteria, and allow the person with the criminal record to reside in the unit as a live-in aide due to the special function he or she plays in the tenant’s life</em>. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153220"></a>What makes a request for a reasonable accommodation successful?</h3>
<p class="text">Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is successful will depend upon the facts and an interpretation of reasonable accommodation rules, discussed in Appendix D, PG. 453.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153221"></a>I am a live-in aide in a government-assisted unit, but the person who I was caring for has left the unit. Do I have a right to stay?</h3>
<p class="text">No.<em> </em>If you are a live-in aide, you have NO RIGHT to continue living in the assisted unit if the tenant needing the assistance leaves.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1228" id="footnote-ref-1228">[1228]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>

<p class="textbox">This section will help you understand how to challenge a denial from a federal government-assisted housing program, and what to expect in the process. If you are denied government-assisted housing, you have the right to receive notice of the denial with the SPECIFIC REASONS for the denial—including anything that came up in your criminal records (see PG. 56 for what PHAs and government-assisted owners can access). You also have the right to a review of the denial—which could be a very informal meeting or hearing (see PG. 78 about what those look like) and the right to receive information on how to prepare for that informal hearing/review. You also have rights during the review hearing process AND the right to challenge the decision if you still disagree. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153227"></a>When would I challenge a denial from a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">If the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing discriminated against you in a way that was illegal, or abused their discretion in denying you the housing—either for something in your criminal record, a disability, OR because they relied on mistaken information—then you will want to challenge that denial by asking for a review of the decision. YOU WILL ALSO WANT TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE (see PG. 398 about mitigating circumstances and proof of your rehabilitation) to prove that you should not have been denied. The PHA or owner of government-assisted housing must follow certain laws and rules when considering your past convictions and criminal history information. They may only reject you for criminal activity that <em>threatens the health, safety, or peace of other residents or staff AND the criminal activity must be “reasonably recent.” For more information on these protections, go to PG. 379.</em></p>

<p class="sidebox">Language of Notice: If there are a lot of non-English speakers served by the PHA or owner, the notice may have to be written in the language used by the applicant. If you need the notice to be translated, ask the PHA or owner for a copy in your native language.</p>
<p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisheavy">RECALL—<em>Important Information about the “Catch-All” Ban:</em></span> Under the “CATCH-ALL” ban (described in detail on PG. 384), there are many situations in which a PHA and/or owner of government-assisted housing is allowed BUT NOT REQUIRED to deny you. In fact, the law limits the ways that PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing can exclude you passed on your past criminal history.  </p>
<h3><a id="Understand_denial_reason_gov_housing"></a><a id="_Toc448153228"></a>If I was denied government-assisted housing, how will I know the reason why?</h3>
<p class="text">If you were denied housing due to <em>information that showed up in your criminal record</em>, then the PHA also MUST give you a copy of the criminal record it used. This will help you to understand why you were denied.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1229" id="footnote-ref-1229">[1229]</a></sup></sup></span>Furthermore, if you are denied admission to federal government-assisted housing, you have the right to WRITTEN <em>detailed notice of the denial</em>—THIS SHOULD EXPLAIN THE SPECIFIC REASON(S) YOU WERE DENIED!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1230" id="footnote-ref-1230">[1230]</a></sup></sup> Sometimes, PHAs and owners will give you a general notice just telling you that you were denied, but not the specific conduct or offense that was the basis for the decision. If you get a general notice without the important details, you should ask for the detailed notice—which you have the right to! The PHA or owner of government-assisted housing MUST provide you with a detailed notice under law.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1231" id="footnote-ref-1231">[1231]</a></sup></sup> </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">Challenging the rejection may give you the necessary time to improve or gather information to clarify your criminal history. If you haven’t already done so, you should request a copy of your criminal record and try to correct any mistakes. [CROSS-REFERENCE TO RECORD-CLEANING SECTION] You should also gather evidence of rehabilitation and mitigating evidence.</p>
<h3><a id="Challenge_gov_housing_decision_timeline"></a><a id="_Toc448153229"></a>What is the timeline for challenging a denial to government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="textbox">In terms of timing, if you want to challenge a denial, you should request a “review hearing” <em>in writing</em> as soon as you receive notice of the denial. There are strict time deadlines for requesting a review hearing, and they are different for every housing program. You must stick to the deadline, so READ THE NOTICE of denial! You may have <em>as little as 1 week</em> (7 days) to request a review hearing! If you miss the deadline, you will not only lose the housing unit, but will also be taken off the waitlist and have to reapply. If you request a review hearing on time, the housing unit will be held for you until there is a final decision!</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153230"></a>Will I definitely get into government-assisted housing if I am successful in challenging the initial denial?</h3>
<p class="text">No, not necessarily. If you are successful, you could get admitted into housing, but you might just get another review of the facts or another hearing—which could help you get in, or could still result in denial.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1232" id="footnote-ref-1232">[1232]</a></sup></sup></span> What you will get, if successful, is a fairer hearing.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153231"></a>How can I figure out the specific procedures for challenging a denial to government-assisted housing?</h3>
<p class="text">The notice will tell you the specific procedure for challenging the denial for that particular housing program. The first step in challenging any denial, however, is always to submit a WRITTEN request for a review hearing, where you can fight the denial. Under law, you<em> almost always</em> have the right to a review of denial from government-assisted housing.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1233" id="footnote-ref-1233">[1233]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<p class="sidebox">Although not required, the denial letter (rejection notice) should also state the <em>legal services offices nearest to you</em>. If its does, call that office for extra help!</p>
<p class="text">The notice of denial will tell you who to send the written request for a review hearing to AND when you need to do it (the timing deadline by which you have to challenge the denial).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1234" id="footnote-ref-1234">[1234]</a></sup></sup> The time frames must be “reasonable”—which usually means within 10-30 days.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1235" id="footnote-ref-1235">[1235]</a></sup></sup> Follow the deadlines that you are given! In sum, if you were denied from housing because of your record and you want to fight it, your first step will be to request a review hearing in writing, and you always should. <em>ALWAYS ASK FOR A HEARING WITHIN THE DEADLINE LISTED ON YOUR DENIAL NOTICE—and follow all of the procedures the notice gives you!</em></p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! ASK YOUR SUPPORTERS TO COME TO THE HEARING WITH YOU! If there are individuals who are willing to accompany you to your hearing and testify (talk about how your circumstances have changed and to support your housing application), their attendance can help!</p>
<h2 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153232"></a>Review Hearings: The Way to Challenge a Denial to Government-Assisted Housing<a id="Informal_hearing"></a></h2>
<p class="text">Requesting a review hearing is one of the most important avenues for challenging a denial to most types of government-assisted housing (whether it was a denial by the Public Housing Authority (PHA) or an owner of government-assisted housing).Of course, if you can, it’s best to find a lawyer or advocate who can help you through this process. It’s tough to find lawyers who do this, but it’s worth a try. See PG 1180 for a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to help advise you as you challenge your denial from government-assisted housing. If you cannot find a lawyer to help you, do not despair! It’s possible to do this on your own!</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153233"></a>What can I expect at the review hearing? And how can I prepare?</h3>
<p class="text"><strong>THE HEARING:</strong>Once I have sent in a written request for a review hearing, how can I prepare for the review hearing? At the informal hearing or review, you are going to want to show the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing that you should not have been denied the housing because of mitigating circumstances/ proof of rehabilitation (see PG. 398), a disability that requires a reasonable accommodation (see Appendix D, PG. 453), or a mistake in the criminal records that the PHA or owner used (see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1038). Before the informal hearing/review, you should:</p>
<ol class="text">Ask the PHA or owner for <em>all</em> documents and information regarding the denial of your housing application, including a copy of the criminal records it relied upon to deny you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1236" id="footnote-ref-1236">[1236]</a></sup></sup>Get a copy of your criminal record yourself to make sure it is correct. (For information on how to do this, see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1048). <em>Compare</em> your criminal record with the information the PHA or owner used to deny you.At the same time, you will want to work on fixing any mistakes in the records used by the PHA or owner—or showing documentation of the errors. Records often have mistakes and you shouldn’t be denied housing for an error.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1237" id="footnote-ref-1237">[1237]</a></sup></sup> (See CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1044.) This can take time, so you should act fast, and ask the PHA and/or owner of the government-assisted housing to hold the unit while you collect the documents you need.Review your application &amp; be prepared to talk about important differences. Make sure you know what you wrote on your application about your criminal record, illegal drug use, or whatever it was that made you get denied for the housing. For example, what did you say in response to the question about your convictions? What did you say about your illegal drug use? Whom did you say would live in your household? If the answer you gave on your application is not exactly the same as the answer you would give today, you must be able to explain why. If you didn’t include certain information about your criminal record in your application to the PHA or owner, you will have to explain why it was left out. Or if you said that a certain relative would be living with you who is not, you need to explain what has changed. </ol>
<p class="text"><strong>IMPORANT:</strong> If you were denied under a ban that is allowed but not required, then you will want to prove to the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing that there are mitigating circumstances or evidence that you have changed and rehabilitated since the time of your offense. If you were denied because of your criminal history, you should present evidence of rehabilitation to show the PHA you are <em>not</em> a threat to the health or safety of other residents, PHA staff or contractors. This includes all the letters and documents you can think of that will show how you have changed and grown since your negative conduct. You should get any of the following: letters of support.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1238" id="footnote-ref-1238">[1238]</a></sup></sup> Ask people who have supported you through reentry—like your current employer, a teacher, probation officer, social worker, neighbors, current or prior landlords, and community leaders-- to write a letter of support on your behalf. The letters should emphasize:</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT!</h4>
<p class="sidebox"> You have the opportunity to tell the hearing officer why the decision he/she made is wrong</p>
<h4 class="sidebox">TIPS:</h4>
<ul class="sidebox">Try to explain clearly what they missed, made mistake on, or why their decision was wrong.Be as composed and clear as possible.Bring a friend, witness, and/or lawyer or advocate if you can.</ul>
<ol class="text">How your circumstances have changed since the negative conduct/ offense,That you are a good person who gets along well with others,That you are motivated to improve your life, <em>and</em>Your good performance or attendance record if you are in school or working.</ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153234"></a>What can I expect from the review hearing?<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1239" id="footnote-ref-1239">[1239]</a></sup></sup></strong> What is it like?</h3>
<p class="text">Every hearing is different,<em> but generally, </em>the hearing is likely to be very informal (more details about these informal hearings below). It is <em>very different</em> from a court proceeding, and formal evidence rules do NOT apply. For example, the PHA or owner may introduce newspaper reports, police blotters, declarations or criminal records, with no one to authenticate or testify about the records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1240" id="footnote-ref-1240">[1240]</a></sup></sup> You are also allowed to bring in any evidence showing why your criminal record should not bar you from getting into the housing program.You are allowed, <em>and it’s recommended, </em>that you bring a friend or family member who can be supportive and can also be a witness to what is happening and what is said at the hearing.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153235"></a>What rights do I have in a review hearing?</h3>
<ol class="text"><strong>You have the right to a hearing before an impartial, unbiased hearing officer.</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1241" id="footnote-ref-1241">[1241]</a></sup></sup> That means that hearing officer should be independent, with no stake in the outcome of the hearing, and ready to hear both sides. He/she <em>should not </em>be the same person who made the original decision to deny you, or anyone <em>who works for</em> the person who made the original decision to deny you<strong><sup>.</sup></strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1242" id="footnote-ref-1242">[1242]</a></sup></sup><strong>You have the right to an opportunity to make an argument (called a “rebuttal”) to challenge the information the PHA or owner relied upon in denying you</strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1243" id="footnote-ref-1243">[1243]</a></sup></sup><strong>You should be allowed to explain why you pled guilty to a past conviction</strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1244" id="footnote-ref-1244">[1244]</a></sup></sup> The hearing’s decision maker may find your explanation important and relevant.<strong>You should ask for a written transcript and an audio recording of the review hearing (the “record”)</strong>. If the hearing officer won’t provide you this, you can ask to bring in your own recording device (many cell phones have this function).<strong>Question witnesses, and to ask that they testify under oath</strong>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1245" id="footnote-ref-1245">[1245]</a></sup></sup><strong>The right to a written decision after the review hearing (for most government-assisted housing programs).</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1246" id="footnote-ref-1246">[1246]</a></sup></sup> The written decision must be given to you within a <em>reasonable period of time</em> (usually 10-30 days), state the <em>reasons</em> for the decision, and state the <em>evidence</em> the hearing officer relied upon in making a decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1247" id="footnote-ref-1247">[1247]</a></sup></sup><strong>Extra Rights for Public Housing &amp; Voucher housing programs</strong>: In addition to the requirements above, for public housing and the voucher program ONLY, there is the additional protection that the subject of the hearing can <em>only go into the issues that were presented in the rejection notice</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1248" id="footnote-ref-1248">[1248]</a></sup></sup> At the hearing, no information should be presented if it was not the basis for the rejection, because otherwise you don’t have an opportunity to investigate ahead of time and challenge that new information at the hearing.<strong>The Rules for Rural Development (RD) housing hearings are different</strong>. To learn about that process, see APPENDIX I, PG. 473. </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153236"></a>What can I do if I am unhappy with the written decision by the review hearing?</h3>
<p class="text">If you are unhappy with the decision made at the review hearing, and want to challenge it further, ask the hearing officer or an attorney on how to challenge that decision. Usually, if you lose your informal hearing, you cannot continue to challenge the denial of government housing at the Public Housing Authority (PHA) level. Most likely, the only way for you to continue to challenge the denial after losing your informal review hearing is to sue the Public Housing Authority in court.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1249" id="footnote-ref-1249">[1249]</a></sup></sup></span> This is a big decision and a lawyer can help you figure out your options, since ever individual case is different.

<h3><a id="_Toc448153239"></a>I am planning to rent an apartment (private or government-assisted). <a id="General_tips_for_renters"></a>What are some general tips for renters?</h3>
<p class="text">These tips can help you prepare for the process of renting an apartment, and avoid problems related to background checks!</p>
<h4>ORDER YOUR FREE CREDIT REPORT BEFORE YOU APPLY FOR AN APARTMENT. </h4>
<p class="text">The landlord will almost certainly order your credit report before letting you live as a tenant in his/her unit. Even though this Chapter does not go into all of the rules and laws that govern credit check, it’s still important to understand that this is part of what most landlords will be looking at. Before you apply to ANY type of housing, you can order your own credit report to make sure that all the information is accurate and up-to-date. You can order your credit reports free once every 12 months from each of the three national credit bureaus: (1) Experian, (2) TransUnion, and (3) Equifax. To learn more, see the Federal Trade Commission’s information on Free Annual Credit Reports on its website: <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/freereports/index.shtml">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/freereports/index.shtml</a> (Note: this is a trusted government website about credit reports).</p>
<h4>LEARN ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS/ TENANT REPORTS. </h4>
<p class="text">Most landlords use "tenant reports” (these are background checks specifically for the purposes of housing and renting apartments) to screen housing applicants. As discussed on PG. 407, these reports can include both credit history and non-credit information such as your criminal record; court cases related to past evictions; references from former landlords; information from local, state and national databases (such as Sex Offender registries); and more. If you learn you that the landlord is going to order a background check/tenant report on you, you could save yourself a lot of time and trouble by simply asking the landlord the name and contact information for the screening company, so that you find the tenant report yourself and make sure the information is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<h4>UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES AS A RENTER. </h4>
<p class="text">If you live in government-assisted housing, a good place to start is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD website about renting in California: <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/states/california/renting">http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/states/california/renting</a>.Carefully review any lease or rental agreement before you sign it. Be sure that any WRITTEN agreements include VERBAL conversations you had with the landlord or property management company—so that those agreements will be legally enforceable later on. As well as general rules about rent payments, utilities, and the time period covered, a lease or rental agreement should cover anything you have discussed together: things like pets, visitors, roommates, or subletting.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1250" id="footnote-ref-1250">[1250]</a></sup></sup> If you know there is something in the lease or agreement that limits your basic legal rights, bring that up with the landlord. In California, the Department of Consumer Affairs has published a great guidebook on tenants’ rights available online at: <a href="http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf">http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153240"></a>What are some of my general rights as a renter in California?</h3>
<p class="text">GENERALLY, YOUR BASIC RIGHTS AS A TENANT IN CALIFORNIA (NO MATTER WHAT THE LEASE OR RENTAL AGREEMENTS SAYS) INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<ol class="text">Limits on the amount of the security deposit that the landlord can require you to pay.Limits on the landlord’s right to enter the rental unit.The right to a refund of the security deposit, or a written accounting of how it was used, after you move.The right to sue the landlord for violations of the law or your rental agreement or lease.The right to repair serious defects in the rental unit and to deduct certain repair costs from the rent, under appropriate circumstances.The right to withhold rent under appropriate circumstances.Rights under the warranty of habitability.Protection against retaliatory eviction.These and other rights will be discussed throughout the rest of this booklet.</ol>
<h4>KEEP RECORDS OF YOUR LEASE &amp; OTHER DOCUMENTS related to YOUR APARTMENT.</h4>
<p class="text">Keep a file with your signed lease or rental agreement and any other important documents. The file should include notes of any conversations you have with your landlord or apartment manager regarding repairs, disturbances, disputes, or any other event or incident that may affect your rights as a tenant. It should also include any mail, emails, repair orders, and even notes left on your door. Keep and maintain a separate file for each rental unit you live in.</p>
<h4>AVOID SCAMS. </h4>
<p class="text">Avoid rental scams by recognizing warning signs. Online resources such as Craigslist (<a href="http://www.craigslist.com">www.craigslist.com</a>) are a popular way to search for available rental units. However, scammers also use these sites to place phony rental listings or to hijack a valid listing to attempt to steal your money or identity. If you are asked to wire money—it’s probably a scam! If you are asked to pay a security deposit or an advance on your rent <em>before signing a rental agreement</em>, that is a red flag too. You should also be aware of <em>foreclosure scams</em> targeting unsuspecting renters and upset homeowners. To learn how to spot and avoid foreclosure scams, check out the following website: <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/news/blog/joan_ferenczy/20121008_fraudsters_falsely_advertising_reo_as_rentals.html">http://www.freddiemac.com/news/blog/joan_ferenczy/20121008_fraudsters_falsely_advertising_reo_as_rentals.html</a>.</p>
<h4>REVIEW ALL NOTICES YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR LANDLORD OR RENTAL AGENCY. </h4>
<p class="text">Small problems can become big problems if you ignore them. A landlord’s notice to evict you may give you only a certain number of days to respond. If you do not respond within the given time, the landlord may seek a court order to evict you. Notice of court actions give only a certain number of days to respond! If you have questions about what a notice means, see the list of housing legal aid providers on PG. 1180 to try and speak to a lawyer who may be able to help you.</p>
<h4>KNOW WHERE TO COMPLAIN OR SEEK HELP IF PROBLEMS COME UP. </h4>
<p class="text">Understand that no single law covers all rental situations. And no single federal, state, or local government agency has the ability or authority to investigate every type of problem you might encounter. This guide suggests ways you might make a complaint or challenge a discriminatory act based on your criminal record. But also know that sometimes, private landlords <em>are allowed</em> to make decisions on the basis of your criminal conviction history. Learn more on PG. 380.</p>
<h4>PREPARE THE INFORMATION YOU WILL NEED FOR A RENTAL APPLICATION:</h4>
<h4 class="sidebox">SPECIAL NOTE About illegal Discriminationbecause of the source of your income: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">You may be asked about your source of income. In California, all legitimate and lawful sources of income must be considered the same by a housing provider—they can’t discriminate. Cal. Gov’t Code § 12955(p)(2). For example, your Social Security disability income (SSI/SSDI) should have the same weight in evaluating your income than wages from an office job—a landlord must treat these the same.</p>
<p class="text">A rental application may require you to provide any of the following information:</p>
<ol class="text">Current and past addresses of where you have lived, your employers, your personal references, and your previous/current landlords.Your Social Security Number (SSN) and Driver’s License or State ID number. [Go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER for more information: getting a SSN covered on PG. 40; getting a Driver’s License or California State ID covered beginning on PG. 46.]The number of people expected to live in the unit.Bank account and credit account numbers. Questions about how much you earn and where your income comes from will almost certainly be on the rental application. </ol>
<h4><a id="Private_housing_screening_fee"></a>BE PREPARED TO PAY MOVE-IN COSTS. </h4>
<p class="text">You will likely have to pay for a screening fee when you apply for a place to live from a private landlord. California law allows a landlord to charge you out-of-pocket expenses, and the cost changes yearly.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1251" id="footnote-ref-1251">[1251]</a></sup></sup></span> It costs approximately $50 for a landlord’s screening of you. You will also likely have to pay a security deposit and 1-2 months’ worth of rent after you sign the lease agreement. This can be expensive—be prepared!!</p>
<h4>PROTECTIONS FOR ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS:</h4>
<p class="text">If you are in the military, the Service Members Civil Relief Act gives active duty members the right to terminate a lease when they are ordered to a new permanent location or any change of location that amounts to more than 90 days.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1252" id="footnote-ref-1252">[1252]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h1 class="subheading"><a id="HS_Eviction"></a><a id="_Toc448153241"></a>Evictions</h1>
<p class="text">The HOUSING CHAPTER does NOT go into the specifics of eviction law—but we realize it is an issue you may come across and need help with. Below we include some very basic know-your-rights information if you are facing an eviction or received what is called a “3-Day Notice” from your landlord to do something (like pay rent).It’s also important to know that if you engage in any “new criminal activity,” like committing a new crime, you and your entire household could face eviction.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1253" id="footnote-ref-1253">[1253]</a></sup></sup></span> <em>If you need a lawyer to help with defending against an eviction, please see the list of housing legal aid providers on PG. 1180, who may be able to assist you. If you are facing eviction, it’s important to ACT FAST to respond to the notice of eviction, so get in touch with a housing lawyer as soon as possible.</em></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153242"></a>What is an eviction? </h3>
<p class="text"><em>Eviction</em> is a process that a landlord can use to remove a tenant from a rental unit. The fancy legal term for an eviction lawsuit is an “unlawful detainer” action. It is called “unlawful detainer” because the landlord is accusing the tenant of staying in a rental unit when he or she does not have a legal right to do so, therefore, the rental unit is unlawfully detained. To “be evicted” means (1) you were the defendant (the renter who is being accused of unlawfully staying in the rental unit) in this type of lawsuit, (2) you lost the lawsuit, and (3) the court then ordered you to move out of the apartment or rental unit. If you leave a rental unit because the landlord asks you to do so, but you are never served with “unlawful detainer” eviction court papers, then you have not been evicted in the legal sense of the word.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1254" id="footnote-ref-1254">[1254]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153243"></a>I am facing an eviction. What are my options?</h3>
<p class="text">Since responding to an eviction notice can be VERY time-sensitive, it’s important to respond and act fast! Keep reading this section to learn more. It can also be VERY HELPFUL to have a lawyer assist you. <em>If you need a lawyer to help with defending against an eviction, see the list of housing legal aid providers on PG. 1180 for organizations that may be able to assist you.</em></p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153244"></a>I received a 3-day notice to do something from my landlord. Can I be evicted because of this notice?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1255" id="footnote-ref-1255">[1255]</a></sup></strong></h3>
<p class="text">There are different kinds of “3-Day” notices. Most 3-Day notices can be corrected without having to actually move out of your apartment or home. The most common is the 3-Day notice “to pay rent or quit.” A landlord can give other kinds of 3-Day notices, as well. Another common one is the notice that says the tenant (the person living in the apartment who is on the lease) has created a nuisance or has done something which is not allowed under the rules of the lease agreement. All of these notices must be <em>in writing.</em></p>
<h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO “PAY RENT OR QUIT”:</h4>
<p class="text">If your rent is late or not paid in full, the landlord may give you a notice called a “Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.” The landlord cannot give you this notice until the rent is late. This notice must be in writing.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153245"></a>What must a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit” say?</h3>
<p><strong>Under law, the notice must state:</strong></p>
<ol class="text">The exact amount of rent you owe (generally, this may NOT include late charges or other fees, although some courts have allowed late charges to be included);That you have a choice of paying the rent or MOVING OUT (“Quit” is the legal term for moving out);Your correct address;The name, address and telephone number of the person you are supposed to pay the rent to; ANDIf you are allowed to pay rent in person, the usual days and hours the person receiving the rent will be available. <em>Note:</em> If there is some other way you are supposed to pay rent, the landlord may have to explain that to you.</ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153246"></a>What are my options if I get a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit”?</h3>
<p class="text">To figure out when the third day is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to pay or move. (1) <strong>One choice</strong> is that you can move out during the 3 days. If you move out at this time, technically, the landlord CANNOT file a court eviction against you. However, some landlords try to do so anyway. If this happens, you should call a legal aid office immediately; see a list of legal aid providers across California on PG. 1180 that may be able to assist you.</p>
<p><strong>Also, even if you move out within the 3 days, the landlord can later sue you for past rent due. Most landlords will not bother with this.</strong></p>
<p class="text">(2) <strong>Another choice</strong> is to pay the rent. If you decide to pay, you should pay the ENTIRE AMOUNT that the notice asks for, before the three days are up. Make sure that you get a receipt. If you cannot pay the full amount, you may be better off not paying anything —unless you can agree on a payment schedule with the landlord. If you reach such an agreement, make sure it is in writing and keep a copy of the agreement.If you offer the full amount asked for within the 3 days, the landlord MUST ACCEPT the money from you. If you think the landlord might refuse your money, take along a friend to be a witness just in case. After the 3 days, the landlord does not have to accept any money from you. If you decide to try to pay the landlord even though the 3 days are up, you should get a RECEIPT and ask the landlord to agree IN WRITING not to evict you. If the landlord refuses to agree to that, the landlord may still try to evict you.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153247"></a>What could happen if I do not pay my rent or do not move within the 3 days?</h3>
<p class="text">The landlord must go to court to evict you.After the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The 3-Day notice is only the <em>first step</em> in the eviction process. The landlord must go to court and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see PG. 435.</p>
<h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO PERFORM COVENANT(S) OR QUIT</h4>
<p class="text">Sometimes this kind of notice is called “3-Day Notice to Perform or Quit.” The landlord will give you this notice if s/he believes that you did something OR failed to do something that violated your lease or rental agreement. Some examples include, if you did not pick up trash around your place, if you took in pets when they are not allowed, or if you left a junk car in the parking lot. This notice must be IN WRITING.After you get this notice, you have 3 days to fix the problem or move out.To figure out when the last day to fix the problem or move out is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to correct the problem. If you do not fix the problem and if you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, after the three days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The landlord must file court papers and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see PG. 435.If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of breaking the lease, you should write to your landlord explaining your side of the story. Make sure to date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. Make a copy of it to keep for your records.If you already have broken the lease or rental agreement but now you agree to obey it, you should write a letter to the landlord. Tell him or her that you have done what the notice requested and that you will obey the lease agreement from now on. Sign and date the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. Keep a copy for your records.</p>
<h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO QUIT</h4>
<p class="text">This kind of notice orders you to move because you have done something that the landlord believes cannot be corrected. This is the most serious notice your landlord can give you. For example, you may get this kind of notice if you have done illegal things (such as using or dealing drugs) on the property. This notice does not give you the chance to correct what was done. This notice means your landlord just wants you to move out. This notice must be in writing.If you feel that you are being wrongly accused of doing something that you did not do, you should write to your landlord immediately and state that you did not do what you are accused of doing. Make sure you date and sign the letter and get it to the landlord as soon as possible. You must also keep a copy of the letter for your records.If you do not move out by the third day, your landlord may start the court process to evict you. However, as with other eviction notices, after the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply kick you out without a court order.</p>
<h4>SERVICE OF THE 3-DAY NOTICE</h4>
<p class="text"> The law states that you must be given a 3-Day Notice in writing. The courts are not always strict about how the landlord gives the 3-Day Notice to you. However, the law says that the landlord must give the notice to in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol class="text"><strong>Personal Service</strong> — by handing you a copy.<strong>Substituted Service</strong> — if you are not home or at your usual workplace, a copy can be left at either place with a person who is old enough to understand the importance of the 3-Day Notice. A copy of the notice must also be mailed to you. Keep the envelope in which the notice was mailed.<strong>“Nail and Mail”</strong> — if the landlord cannot do either of the above, a copy of the 3-Day Notice can be posted on your property in a place that you will find it. A copy of the notice must also be mailed to you. </ol>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153248"></a>What could happen if my landlord takes me to court to evict me?</h3>
<p class="text">If the landlord takes you to court to evict you, you will get legal papers called a “Summons” and a “Complaint.” Make a note of what day you receive these papers. You have 5 days from the day you receive the Summons and Complaint to respond to the court. To count the 5 days: start counting with the day after you received the papers. You must count Saturdays and Sundays, but do not count court holidays. If the 5<sup>th</sup> day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, you will have until the end of the next court business day to “answer” these papers. <em>Example: Jane gets the Summons and Complaint papers on a Monday. Tuesday is the first day of the 5 days. The 5th day would be a Saturday. Jane has until the next business day, Monday, to file her papers. If Monday is a holiday, Jane has until Tuesday. </em>If you want to fight the eviction, you should contact a legal aid lawyer immediately. Do NOT wait until the fifth day to call!! If you wait until the last minute, they may not be able to help you.Within those 5 days, you can file a written response to the landlord’s summons and complaint. You must use the right legal form and file it in the same court where the “Complaint” was filed. This form is called an “Answer.” If you are low-income and file a separate form called an “Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs,” you will probably not need to pay the court filing fees. You can get both the Answer and the Fee Waiver forms at the court clerk’s office.When you fill out the Answer, you will need to list any legal defenses to the eviction. After you file the Answer, you will receive a “Memorandum to Set Case for Trial” and a notice of the trial date by mail. Generally, the trial must be within 20 days of when the landlord files the “Memorandum to Set Case for Trial.” The court clerk must mail you the notice telling you when the trial will be at least ten days before the trial. When your court date comes up, plan to arrive early at the courthouse so that you can find parking, get through the security check, and find the courtroom. If you are late and the judge has already called your case, you will lose your case.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153249"></a>What could happen if I ignore the summons and complaint and do nothing?</h3>
<p class="text">After the five days are up, if you have not filed an Answer to challenge the eviction, the landlord can ask the court clerk for a “default judgment.” If this happens, you will NOT go before a judge. This means that the landlord automatically wins the case and gets the property back from you.Sometimes the court will allow you to “re-open” the case after entering a “default judgment” if you have a good reason for not filing the Answer on time. If this happens to you, contact a legal aid organization and ask for assistance with a default eviction.<strong>NOTE:</strong> You should not assume that the court will allow you to “re-open” your case. In many cases, the tenant’s request is denied. Therefore, you must try to file your Answer within the 5 days so that you do not lose your case by missing a legal deadline.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153250"></a>What could happen if I lose in court or after a judgment against me?</h3>
<p class="text">If the landlord wins or gets a default judgment against you, the landlord will get a form called a “Writ of Possession.” The landlord takes this writ to the Sheriff’s Department who will then bring you (or post on your door) a “Notice to Vacate.” The notice will give you at least 5 days before the officer will come back to evict you. The Notice to Vacate will tell you exactly by what date and time you must be out of the house or apartment. Even if you are not completely moved out, the sheriff can prevent you from re-entering the house to get your stuff after the time and date listed on the notice. If you cannot get all of your belongings out in time, at least remove your important papers, medications, valuables, and clothing. If you leave things behind, you can claim them within 15 days of the eviction, but you will have to pay the storage and removal costs. However, the landlord cannot require you to pay back rent, attorney’s fees or court costs in order to get your belongings back. </p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153251"></a>How long does the eviction process take?</h3>
<p class="text">If you do not file an “Answer” to the eviction notice, the sheriff may be out to evict you as soon as 11 days after you receive the <em>Summons</em> and <em>Complaint</em>. If you file an Answer to the lawsuit, the process will take a little longer. Do not expect the entire process to take more than 1 month—it could take even less than 1 month. Contrary to some popular belief, you can be evicted if even if you are pregnant, have small children, have an unexpected financial hardship (like losing your job), if you’ve never been late with the rent before or if you have nowhere else to move.</p>
<h3><a id="_Toc448153252"></a>I live in transitional housing, and the housing provider (or parole) IS trying to evict me with very little notice &amp; without going to court. Is this legal &amp; what are my options?</h3>
<p class="text">In most cases, a transitional housing provider MUST follow all of the normal rules and laws to evict you. That means they must follow all of the rules for giving you proper notice and taking you to court if they want to evict you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1256" id="footnote-ref-1256">[1256]</a></sup></sup></span>** There is one <em>VERY SMALL EXCEPTION</em> that could allow a transitional housing provider to evict you more quickly than the standard court process. However, for this exception to apply, it must be <em>explicitly</em> written in the contract you signed with the transitional housing provider. There are other requirements beyond that, but at a minimum, if it’s not in your contract with the transitional housing provider, then the transitional housing provider can’t evict you overnight, with little notice, or without first going to court.If this issue is a condition of your supervision (a requirement of parole or probation), see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130, to learn more about rules (called “conditions”) of different types of supervision in California, and how to challenge them.</p>
<h2><a id="_Toc448153253"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p class="text">Where you live is critical to your well-being. Unfortunately, it can also be one of the most challenging aspects of reentry. Hopefully, this Chapter has helped you understand your housing options, and given you the tools to help you to find appropriate housing and recognize illegal discrimination when it occurs.</p>

<div class="questionheading">AS SOMEONE APPLYING FOR HOUSING (PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED), WHAT DO MY DISABILITIES HAVE TO DO WITH MY CRIMINAL RECORD?</div>
<p class="text">If you can prove that your criminal conviction was <em>the result of a disability</em>—for example, due to mental illness and/or past drug addiction you may be able to get a “reasonable accommodation” when applying for ANY type of housing. However, a PHA, owner, or other housing provider is not required to grant a reasonable accommodation to an individual with a disability <em>if that person would be a “direct threat” to the health, safety or property of others,</em> unless the requested reasonable accommodations can actually <em>eliminate or significantly reduce such a threat</em>.<em> </em>Under the law, housing providers cannot treat persons with disabilities exactly the same as other housing applicants or residents if doing so denies people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1258" id="footnote-ref-1258">[1258]</a></sup></sup> Therefore, by law, a PHA or owner <em>must</em> make reasonable accommodations to its <em>rules, policies, practices, or services </em>when it may be necessary to provide applicants with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1259" id="footnote-ref-1259">[1259]</a></sup></sup>—<em>even if</em> that accommodation results in a preference for disabled individuals over similar, non-disabled individuals.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1260" id="footnote-ref-1260">[1260]</a></sup></sup><em> </em>This rule applies to ALL types of housing—public and private. </p>
<p class="importantbox">WARNING: Just because you committed a criminal offense as a result of a disability does not mean you automatically have the right to a reasonable accommodation for housing. It can be very difficult to prove that your disability CAUSED your criminal offense, AND that the disability is the type that qualifies you for a reasonable accommodation</p>
<div class="questionheading"><a id="Disability"></a>IF MY CRIMINAL CONVICTION WAS THE RESULT OF A DISABILITY, WHAT IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION THAT I CAN ASK FOR?</div>
<p class="text">A “reasonable accommodation” is a <em>change, exception, or adjustment</em> to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be necessary to give an applicant with a disability an <em>equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1261" id="footnote-ref-1261">[1261]</a></sup></sup> There is no limit or restriction to the type of accommodation that you can request, as long as the accommodation is <em>reasonable</em>. As a general rule, an accommodation will be considered <em>reasonable </em>so long as it does NOT:</p>
<ol class="text">Pose an undue financial burden on the PHA or owner, and/orRequire the PHA or owner to fundamentally change its housing program<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1262" id="footnote-ref-1262">[1262]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<p class="text">It’s recommended that you ask a Public Housing Authority (PHA), owner, or housing provider to look at your criminal record using a different standard, or to make an exception to its criminal history policy altogether. For information on how to ask for a reasonable accommodation from a PHA, owner, or housing provider, see the next page.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS CONSIDERED A DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA? </div>
<p class="text">California law defines a disability as any <em>physical </em>or <em>mental</em> impairment that limits one or more of your <em>major life activities</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1263" id="footnote-ref-1263">[1263]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<h5 class="question">&gt; What is a <em>physical disability</em> in California?</h5>
<p class="answer">A physical impairment is any disease, physical disorder, physical condition, or disfigurement that:</p>
<ol class="text">Affects one or more of your body systems (i.e. your heart, your eyes) or functions (i.e. breathing, speaking), and Limits a <em>major life activity.</em><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1264" id="footnote-ref-1264">[1264]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<p><strong>&gt; What counts as a <em>mental impairment</em>?</strong></p>
<p>A mental impairment<em> </em>is any mental or psychological condition that limits a <em>major life activity</em>. Common examples of mental impairments are:</p>
<ol class="text">Intellectual disabilities Brain disease Emotional or mental illnessesLearning disabilitiesAny other mental or psychological condition that requires special attention or services<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1265" id="footnote-ref-1265">[1265]</a></sup></sup></span> </ol>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS NOT CONSIDERED A DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA?</div>
<p class="text">It is not a protected disability if you are:</p>
<ol class="text">Currently engaged in illegal drug use;Currently abusing alcohol in a way that interferes with others’ health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the property;People who pose a substantial threat to others, that cannot be controlled by a reasonable accommodation (see below for more information on reasonable accommodations)<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1266" id="footnote-ref-1266">[1266]</a></sup></sup></span> </ol>
<div class="questionheading">DOES DRUG ADDICTION QUALIFY AS A DISABILITY?</div>
<p>Technically, yes, if it is <em>PAST</em> drug use and you have permanently stopped using illegal drugs, it does qualify as a disability under both federal and state law. BUT If you are <em>currently using illegal drugs, then you are not considered disabled</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1267" id="footnote-ref-1267">[1267]</a></sup></sup></span> See the next question for what is considered a disability in California.</p>
<p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! There are no reported California cases where a rehabilitated applicant with a history of substance abuse, or an applicant with mental impairment, and a history of criminal acts arising from the substance abuse or mental illness has been granted a reasonable accommodation from a PHA’s criminal activity restrictions. Courts have generally been unreceptive to these arguments.Specifically, courts have been hesitant to accept arguments that a housing applicant’s criminal convictions were the result of mental illness and/or past substance abuse. Again, since it may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction, it is important that you offer as much evidence as possible. </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">REMEMBER: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">It may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction. It is important that you submit as much evidence as possible!</p>
<div class="questionheading">HOW can I PROVE MY PAST DRUG USE QUALIFIES AS A DISABILITY?</div>
<p class="text">Under this rule, it can be tricky to prove that you are not a current illegal drug user, especially if there was drug use or convictions for drug use in your recent past. <a id="Recent_drug_use_housing"></a>The law doesn’t clearly define what counts as “current” illegal drug use, and there are no reported California court decisions defining “current” illegal drug use.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1268" id="footnote-ref-1268">[1268]</a></sup></sup></span> Some courts outside of California have said a person is NOT a current illegal drug user if that person has <em>permanently stopped using illegal drugs</em> for periods of time ranging from a few months to a year.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1269" id="footnote-ref-1269">[1269]</a></sup></sup></span> Outside of California, courts have said that someone is still a “current” user if they have stopped using for only a few weeks.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1270" id="footnote-ref-1270">[1270]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4 class="sidebox">EXAMPLES OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDE:</h4>
<ul class="sidebox">An exception (“a waiver”) to a PHA, owner, or housing provider’s policy that bars housing to applicants with criminal records, if your criminal conviction was caused by your disability;An owner or housing provider agreeing to admit a tenant with a mental illness that causes the tenant to sometimes become loud or confrontational, so long as the tenant agrees to seek treatment for his or her mental illness;An owner or housing provider allowing a tenant suffering from mental illness to have a live-in aid; orA PHA, owner, or housing provider accepting a reference from an applicant’s social worker or service provider if an applicant has no recent rental history.</ul>
<p>Based on the different ways courts are treating this issue, we recommend that you <em>provide evidence</em> that you are <em>not a current user</em> by showing any proof that:</p>
<ol class="text">You have successfully completed a supervised substance abuse/drug rehabilitation program;You are not currently using illegal drugs (meaning any proof that you have permanently stopped using illegal drugs); and/orYou are currently participating in a supervised substance abuse/drug rehabilitation, treatment, or self-help program<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1271" id="footnote-ref-1271">[1271]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<div class="questionheading"><a id="HSG_App_E_HowToAsk_Rsnbl_Accom"></a>IF I CAN SHOW THAT I’M DISABLED, HOW can I REQUEST A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AS I APPLY FOR HOUSING?</div>
<p class="text">Send a letter to the PHA/housing provider/owner/landlord (whomever is making the decision) requesting a reasonable accommodation. You should SEND A WRITTEN LETTER with a request that clearly explains <em>ALL</em> of the following:</p>
<ol class="text">That you have a disability, and what that disability is.That the disability caused the offense. Attach any documentation you have, like:Letters from service providers showing that you experienced a mental illness and/or a drug addiction at the time of the offense;It’s even better if you can have a doctor submit a letter confirming the existence of your disability<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1272" id="footnote-ref-1272">[1272]</a></sup></sup></span>If it is addiction, explain that you no longer suffer from addiction. Attach any documentation you have, like: Letters from service providers showing successful completion of a rehabilitation program or effective or ongoing treatment for your addiction;Letters from service providers that show you are no longer using substances.What your requested accommodation is, clearly stated:Ask for what you want directly!! You could ask a PHA, owner, or housing provider to look at your criminal record using a different standard, or to make an exception to its criminal history policy altogether.<a id="Step4_reasonable_accomodations"></a>Why the accommodation you are requesting is NECESSARY and REASONABLE.Here, you should say that <em>an exception</em> from criminal history policy is NECESSARY to give you an <em>equal opportunity to access the housing</em>.Explain how your criminal conduct <em>was the result</em> of the disability —showing the <em>relationship</em> (also called a “nexus”) between your disability and your requested accommodation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1273" id="footnote-ref-1273">[1273]</a></sup></sup>It is helpful and more persuasive if you have a doctor or service provider submit a letter explaining why your disability requires a reasonable accommodation.You must also show that the requested accommodation is<em> </em>REASONABLE. A requested accommodation may be found reasonable if:It’s necessary for you to have an equal opportunity to enjoy the living space.It’s not too expensive for the landlord.The administrative burden is not too great.It doesn’t fundamentally change the PHA’s, housing provider’s, or owner/landlord’s operations.A landlord or PHA accommodation that gives you “preference” over similar non-disabled people <em>may be reasonable under the circumstances</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1274" id="footnote-ref-1274">[1274]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<p><strong>THE DIRECT THREAT EXCEPTION:</strong></p>
<p class="text">Remember that the law <em>does not require</em> that reasonable accommodations be granted to an individual with a disability if that person would be a “direct threat” to the health or safety of other individuals or if that person’s residency would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others <em>UNLESS </em>the reasonable accommodations requested can actually <em>eliminate or significantly reduce such a threat</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1275" id="footnote-ref-1275">[1275]</a></sup></sup><em> </em>This is known as the “direct threat” exception. There are some protections for you if a PHA, housing provider, or landlord/owner is arguing that you would be a direct threat to other tenants or property:</p>
<ol class="text">First, a PHA or owner MUST PERFORM an <em>individualized assessment</em> of you.Second, if a reasonable accommodation can significantly reduce the “direct threat” posed by a recognized disability, then the PHA, housing provider, or landlord/owner <em>must</em> make it.Third, if the PHA, housing provider, or landlord/owner finds that you pose a direct threat to other tenants or property, this should be based o<em>nly</em> on actual examples of you causing harm or other factual, objective evidence—not their own fears or assumptions about what <em>could</em> happen.Fourth, a finding of a direct threat cannot be based on assumptions, stereotypes, or fears about mental illness, drug addiction, or other disabilities.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1276" id="footnote-ref-1276">[1276]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<div class="questionheading">ONCE I have SENT MY REQUEST FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION, what happens?</div>
<p class="text">There are several phases of a reasonable accommodation request:<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1277" id="footnote-ref-1277">[1277]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<ol class="text"><strong>Initial request</strong> (see PG. 456). This is when you first send your letter informing the PHA, owner, or housing provider that you have a disability and are requesting a reasonable accommodation<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1278" id="footnote-ref-1278">[1278]</a></sup></sup></span> <strong>Verification</strong>: Once you make your initial request for a reasonable accommodation, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will want to verify that you are indeed disabled.If your disability is obvious or known, and the need for a reasonable accommodation is known, then the housing provider should not ask you for any more information If your disability is known and obvious, but your need for the accommodation is not well-known or obvious, then the housing provider should ask only for information necessary to verify the need for a reasonable accommodation—for example, notes explaining your need from a doctor or clinician. If neither your disability nor the need for your accommodation is known nor obvious, the housing provider may ask for verification of both your disability and your need for a reasonable accommodation.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1279" id="footnote-ref-1279">[1279]</a></sup></sup></span> <strong>The Decision</strong>. After reviewing your request, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will decide whether or not to grant your reasonable accommodation request. <strong>The “Interactive” process</strong>:If the PHA, owner, or housing provider refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you should try to engage them in an informal “interactive process” in which you discuss alternative solutions that might meet both of your needs. HUD guidelines encourage you to try this informal route first, before starting the formal grievance procedure, because it is more flexible and often leads to quicker resolutions.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1280" id="footnote-ref-1280">[1280]</a></sup></sup> If, after engaging in the “interactive process,” the PHA, owner, or housing provider still refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you may have to file a formal Fair Housing complaint with HUD or the DFEH.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1281" id="footnote-ref-1281">[1281]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
<div class="questionheading">HOW can I CHALLENGE MY DENIAL FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION?</div>
<p><strong>OPTION 1: YOU CAN FILE A COMPLAINT.</strong></p>
<p class="text">If you believe that a PHA, owner, or housing provider denied your request for a reasonable accommodation due to your disability and/or your past drug use, you may file a complaint with HUD (federal housing protection agency) or with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1282" id="footnote-ref-1282">[1282]</a></sup></sup></span> After you file a complaint, if HUD or DFEH determines that you were discriminated against (meaning it finds that your complaint has “merit”) then HUD or DFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the PHA, owner, or housing provider on your behalf. Go to Appendix H on PG. 466 to learn how to file a complaint with HUD or DFEH.</p>
<p><strong>OPTION 2: YOU CAN TRY TO SUE IN COURT. </strong></p>
<p class="text">To sue a housing provider under the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA), California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act),<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1283" id="footnote-ref-1283">[1283]</a></sup></sup></span> you must show that your status as an individual with a disability or drug history was a <em>motivating factor</em> in the owner’s or PHA’s decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1284" id="footnote-ref-1284">[1284]</a></sup></sup> You must also provide sufficient evidence that the requested accommodation is reasonable, and that you are a former/ recovering substance user (and not a current substance user), or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1285" id="footnote-ref-1285">[1285]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE PHA, OWNER, or landlord LIKELY TO ARGUE TO DEFEND its decision to DENy my REASONABLE ACCOMDATION?</div>
<p class="text">The PHA or owner will likely argue that you do not have a protected disability.They might argue that, you are a “current user” of illegal drugs or substances, and therefore, you are not disabled under law, OR that you have not sought adequate treatment for your mental illness, and therefore are not disabled under law.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1286" id="footnote-ref-1286">[1286]</a></sup></sup></span> If you go to court, you can attempt to disprove these arguments by providing <em>treatment records</em> establishing that you have not used illegal substances for the relevant period of time, or that you receive treatment for your mental illness.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1287" id="footnote-ref-1287">[1287]</a></sup></sup></span> Your argument will be even stronger if you can provide <em>e</em>vidence of your participation in or completion of a drug/substance abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness.

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppF"></a>Housing Owners’/ Landlords’ Access to Credit Reports</div>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS A CREDIT REPORT?</div>
<p class="text">Your <em>credit report </em>includes information about creditworthiness, such as your record of paying bills on time. A credit report will show information dating back 7 years (or 10 years in the case of a bankruptcy), including the following</p>
<ol class="text">history of paying bills and loans on time or record of late payments;open accounts and level of indebtedness;collection actions;bankruptcies or tax liens; andcivil court judgments, including housing-related court actions filed by a previous landlord that may or may not have led to a past eviction.</ol>
<p class="text">HOWEVER, a credit report does NOT include criminal history information like a tenant report would. </p>
<h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">If you are looking for a rental, it is best to check your credit reports before the PHA or owner does—so you know what they will find. You can go online and order FREE credit reports from the three national credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. If there’s an error, it’s a good idea to file a dispute with the bureau rather than try to explain it at the last minute.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHO CAN ACCESS MY CREDIT REPORT?</div>
<p class="text">Anyone who is evaluating your ability to pay for housing can order your credit report in California. That means that private owners, PHAs, AND owners of government-assisted housing can order a credit report to see if you have good credit and will be a reliable tenant. </p>
<div class="questionheading">DOES MY CONSISTENTLY PAYING RENT ON TIME IN THE PAST HELP MY CREDIT STANDING?</div>
<p class="text">Maybe, but most likely not. The companies that collect information about your credit standing are only just beginning to collect this information in a systematized way. A credit report will show whether or not you’ve ever been evicted, your ability to pay credit card bills, utility bills, and other bills on time, and any success you’ve had paying back loans.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1288" id="footnote-ref-1288">[1288]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
<div class="questionheading">CAN SOMEONE FIND OUT ABOUT PAST LATE PAYMENTS ON RENT FROM A CREDIT REPORT?</div>
<p class="text">Maybe. Generally, late rent payments are not a part of your credit history unless the landlord or management company is reporting them.

<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE? </div>
<p class="text">The <em>San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance</em> is a new law that offers special protections for people with criminal records who apply to certain types of affordable housing in San Francisco.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1289" id="footnote-ref-1289">[1289]</a></sup></sup></span> (If you are interested in the parts of this new law that apply to employment, go the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, Appendix G, on PG. 686.)</p>
<h4>LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ONLINE?</h4>
<p class="textbox">Check out the San Francisco Human Rights Commission’s website about how the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance applies to affordable housing providers: <a href="http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdf">http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdf</a>. </p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT KINDS OF HOUSING DOES THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE PROTECT?</div>
<h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT DEFINITION: </h4>
<p class="sidebox">Under the San Francisco Fair Chance ordinance, <strong>“affordable housing”</strong> is defined as “any residential building in the City that has received funding from the City, connected in whole or in part to restricting rents, the funding being provided either directly or indirectly through funding to another entity that owns, master leases, or develops the building. Affordable Housing also includes ‘affordable units’ in the City as that term is defined in Article 4 of the Planning Code.” The term <strong>“housing provider”</strong> is broad, and includes any entity that owns, master leases, or develops affordable housing, and any agent, such as a property management company, that makes tenancy decisions on behalf if these entities.</p>
<p class="text">It protects applicants and tenants in<em> city-funded affordable housing</em> in San Francisco, CA. It does NOT apply to federally subsidized housing (unless the property is receiving multiple subsidies including city-funded subsidies to keep it affordable).</p>
<div class="questionheading">DOES THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE APPLY TO federal government-assisted HOUSING?</div>
<p class="text"><em>No. </em>These new legal protections apply only to <em>city government-funded affordable housing</em> in San Francisco, CA.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS DOES THIS LAW GIVE ME IF I’M APPLYING TO CITY-FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD?</div>
<p class="text">We break down all the rights it gives you in each step in your affordable housing application process:</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1: YOUR RIGHTS WHEN APPLYING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO</strong></p>
<p class="text">When you are APPLYING, Affordable housing providers in San Francisco:</p>
<ol class="text">MUST NOT have a question about past convictions on the initial application. <em>Before</em> an affordable housing provider asks about your convictions or looks at a background check report on you, it <em>must:</em><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1290" id="footnote-ref-1290">[1290]</a></sup></sup></span>Determine that you are (1) legally eligible to rent the housing unit <em>and </em>(2) qualified to rent the housing unit under the affordable housing provider’s criteria for evaluating rental history and credit history;Provide notice about the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance;<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1291" id="footnote-ref-1291">[1291]</a></sup></sup></span> <em>and</em>Provide notice about state and federal laws about background checks.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1292" id="footnote-ref-1292">[1292]</a></sup></sup></span>MUST NOT have blanket bans like “No Felons Apply.”In ads, they MUST state that they will consider qualified applicants with criminal histories.They MUST have a notice posted about the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1293" id="footnote-ref-1293">[1293]</a></sup></sup></span> <em>Here is an electronic copy of the notice that affordable housing providers must post:</em> <a href="http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdfn">http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdfn</a>. You can also see a copy on APPENDIX G, PG. 462.</ol>
<p><strong>STEP 2: YOUR RIGHTS WHEN ASKED ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p class="text">What can city-funded affordable housing providers in San Francisco ask me about my criminal record after they find I am qualified for the housing in every other way?After you’re found qualified, an affordable housing provider in San Francisco can ask about:</p>
<ol class="text">Pending (open) arrests, andConvictions that are 0–7 years old (based on the date of sentencing).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1294" id="footnote-ref-1294">[1294]</a></sup></sup></span> </ol>
<p class="text">BUT even though they can ask about this information, there are limits on how the affordable housing provider can use it—see Step 3 below.</p>
<p><strong><em>What can city-funded affordable housing providers in San Francisco NEVER ask me about my criminal record?</em></strong></p>
<p class="text">City-funded housing providers in San Francisco can never ask about:</p>
<ol class="text">Arrests that didn’t lead to a conviction;Diversion or deferral programs;Dismissed convictions (which means any conviction that has been dismissed, expunged, voided, invalidated, or made inoperative by the Court);Juvenile convictions;Convictions older than 7 years (based on the date of sentencing);Infractions (meaning anything that is not a misdemeanor or felony under law).<strong>Affordable housing providers cannot ask about these 6 types of cases and can never use them against you at any stage!</strong></ol>
<p><strong>STEP 3: YOUR RIGHTS WHEN BEING CONSIDERED </strong></p>
<p class="text">An affordable housing provider in San Francisco that is considering your conviction history <em>must:</em></p>
<ol class="text">Conduct an individualized assessment—meaning look at all of the circumstances of the person applying to housing and information available about their criminal record, including mitigating circumstances;Consider only “directly-related” convictions — which means that the underlying conduct “has a direct and specific negative bearing on the safety of persons or property, given the nature of the housing;”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1295" id="footnote-ref-1295">[1295]</a></sup></sup></span>Consider the time that has passed since your conviction(s); <em>and</em>Consider any evidence of rehabilitation or mitigating information you share, such as:Completion of parole or probation;Letters of recommendation from employers or others;Education or training you’ve received;Participation in an alcohol/drug treatment program;</ol>
<h4 class="sidebox">IF YOU ARE DENIED, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPOND!!</h4>
<p class="sidebox">You have only <em>14 days</em> to respond. SO ACT FAST! You can respond IN WRITING or VERBALLY by: </p>
<ul class="sidebox">Pointing out any inaccuracies in the background check report, ANDProviding evidence of your rehabilitation or mitigating information. See the list of examples of evidence of your rehabilitation or mitigating information under Step 3 above.</ul>
<ol class="text">Completion of rehabilitation programs; <em>and</em>Any additional context for the conviction—including your age when you were convicted, or mitigating factors like physical or emotional abuse, coercion, untreated abuse/mental illness that led to the conviction.</ol>
<p><strong>STEP 4: YOUR RIGHTS IF YOU ARE DENIED SF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE OF YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD</strong></p>
<p class="text">If an affordable housing provider in SF wants to deny you because of your record<em>, </em>THEY MUST abide by the following rules:</p>
<ol class="text">They cannot deny you because of a conviction more than 7 years old (based on the date of sentencing) They cannot deny you because of arrests that never led to convictions; They must provide you a copy of your background report;They must tell you why you were denied—what the issue was in your conviction history; <em>and</em>Give you <em>14 days</em> to provide information about your rehabilitation or any errors in the background check report.</ol>
<p><strong>STEP 5: YOUR RIGHT TO A FINAL DECISION AFTER YOU RESPOND &amp; ANOTHER LEVEL OF APPEAL</strong></p>
<p class="sidebox">This could be when... An Clear violations include when an affordable housing provider in SF:</p>
<ul class="sidebox">Asks about your criminal record on an initial housing application;Has a blanket ban like “We don’t accept felons,” or didn’t consider your criminal record on a case-by-case basis;Didn’t give you notice of your rights;Denied you because of a conviction that was <em>older </em>than 7 years.</ul>
<p><strong>Must I get notice of the housing provider’s final decision?</strong></p>
<p class="text"><em>Yes. </em>An affordable housing provider in SF who makes a final decision to deny you must give you a final notice. If a final negative decision is made based on your criminal record, you should consider challenging the decision to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. <em>HOW?</em> See STEP 6 below.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 6: REPORT CLEAR VIOLATIONS* TO THE SAN FRANCISCO HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WITHIN 60 DAYS</strong></p>
<p class="text">If you believe that there has been a violation of the rules above, you should report it to the SF Human Rights Commission. This must be done within 60 days of the violation (when you get your final decision).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1296" id="footnote-ref-1296">[1296]</a></sup></sup></span> You can begin the process of reporting a violation by following these 3 steps:</p>
<ol class="text">STEP 1: Fill out a complaint form online here: <a href="http://hrc.sfintranet.firmstep.com/achieveforms-node/discrimination-public-form">http://hrc.sfintranet.firmstep.com/achieveforms-node/discrimination-public-form</a>, and submit. Give as many details about the discrimination as possible! You can submit the complaint form online, by mail, or in person.STEP 2: Call (415) 252-2500 to schedule an intake interview. If you submitted the intake questionnaire online, HRC will contact you to set up an intake interview appointment.STEP 3: After intake, the HRC will try to mediate between you and the housing provide; investigate the alleged violation; and make a finding about whether or not the housing provider broke the law. The HRC’s process for responding to these complaints looks like this:</ol>

<p class="answer">NOTE: HRC's Discrimination Complaints Investigation and Mediation Division investigates and mediates complaints of discrimination and non-compliance in employment, housing, and public accommodation.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1297" id="footnote-ref-1297">[1297]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>
<h4>REMEMBER—YOU ARE AN AGENT OF CHANGE! </h4>
<p><strong>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE TO THE SAN FRANCISCO HRC? </strong></p>
<p><em>It’s important to report violations because:</em></p>
<ol class="text">You are helping to enforce this important law that adds protection for people with criminal records applying for affordable housing in San Francisco;Helping others in your community;The Human Rights Commission (HRC) can find out more information than you can;You could get relief—for example, be admitted into the affordable housing.The affordable housing provider could be penalized by the city—and hopefully wont do it again!<sup><a href="#footnote-1298" id="footnote-ref-1298">[1298]</a></sup> </ol>

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppH"></a>Filing a Complaint for Illegal Discrimination in Private Housing</div>
<p class="text">If you believe you have been illegally discriminated against in applying for <em>private housing</em> from a <em>private landlord</em> (meaning neither the owner, you nor the property receive federal government money to assist in making the housing more affordable), you can challenge that discriminatory denial. Read about how to challenge an illegal discriminatory denial below, and which government agencies you should contact.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS?</div>
<p><strong>FEDERAL HOUSING AGENCY:</strong></p>
<p class="text">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a <em>federal agency</em> that enforces the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1299" id="footnote-ref-1299">[1299]</a></sup></sup></span> HUD has to refer the complaints of housing discrimination it receives to the fair housing enforcement agency in the state where the discrimination occurred <em>if </em>that state’s fair housing agency is certified by HUD as having mostly the same laws, procedures, remedies, and judicial review.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1300" id="footnote-ref-1300">[1300]</a></sup></sup></span> ANDSTATE HOUSING AGENCY:In California, our state fair housing enforcement agency is the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), and it is<em> certified by HUD</em> to enforce, investigate, conciliate, and litigate discriminatory housing practices in California.</p>
<div class="questionheading">I BELIEVE A PRIVATE LANDLORD ILLEGALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ME DUE TO MY CRIMINAL RECORD. WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?</div>
<p class="text">Your 3 main options are: You could file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency);</p>
<ol class="text">You could file an administrative complaint with HUD (the federal housing protection agency);You could file a civil lawsuit in state or federal court;</ol>
<p class="text">OR </p>
<ol class="text">You could allow HUD (the federal housing agency) or California’s DFEH (the state housing agency) to file a lawsuit on your behalf.</ol>
<p class="text">&gt; HOW CAN I FIGURE OUT WHICH OPTION TO CHOOSE? Talk to a lawyer or an advocate at a nonprofit legal services organization if possible—they can help advise you! Also, you can always file a complaint with <em>both</em> HUD &amp; DFEH. More on each of these 3 options below.You can file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH or the federal agency HUD, or both. This may lead to a lawsuit in civil court (possible with both DFEH or HUD) or an administrative hearing (HUD only). Read about how to file a state administrative complaint and a federal administrative complaint below.</p>
<p><strong>OPTION 1: </strong></p>
<p><a id="File_complaint_DFEH"></a><strong>FILING A STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT WITH CALIFORNIA’S DFEH.</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1301" id="footnote-ref-1301">[1301]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p class="text">You can file an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH <em>within 1 year</em> of the discriminatory act.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1302" id="footnote-ref-1302">[1302]</a></sup></sup> To begin the process, you must contact DFEH in writing, online, or by phone, with basic information about the discrimination (what happened to you, when, where, etc.).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1303" id="footnote-ref-1303">[1303]</a></sup></sup> The DFEH will conduct an intake interview to learn more about your situation, and to determine whether you can file a formal (“<em>verified</em>”) complaint.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1304" id="footnote-ref-1304">[1304]</a></sup></sup> See PG. 467 for a step-by-step explanation of the DFEH’s state complaint process.</p>
<h5 class="question">Under what circumstances will California’s DFEH accept my complaint?</h5>
<p class="address">DFEH is supposed to be very generous in accepting your complaint. However, in some cases, the DFEH may decide that you cannot file a complaint—for example, if the landlord’s conduct is legal, happened more than a year ago, or is outside of DFEH’s legal control, or if you already filed a complaint with DFEH or HUD regarding the same discrimination.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1305" id="footnote-ref-1305">[1305]</a></sup></sup></strong></p>
<h5 class="question">How much time does the DFEH have to respond and investigate?</h5>
<p class="address">Once the DFEH accepts your complaint, it must follow certain time limits. The DFEH has <em>10 days</em> to inform you of your procedural rights and obligations.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1306" id="footnote-ref-1306">[1306]</a></sup></sup></strong> The landlord then has <em>20 days</em> to respond to the complaint.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1307" id="footnote-ref-1307">[1307]</a></sup></sup></strong> Within <em>30 days</em>, DFEH must begin to investigate your complaint, and it must finish the investigation within <em>100 days</em>.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1308" id="footnote-ref-1308">[1308]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
<h5 class="question">Will I have to do anything else while I wait for a response from the DFEH?</h5>
<p class="address">Maybe.<em> </em>At some point (before, during, or after the investigation), the DFEH may also require you and the landlord to go through mediation (meaning an alternative dispute resolution or a settlement negotiation) to see whether you can resolve the problem cooperatively.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1309" id="footnote-ref-1309">[1309]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
<p><strong>HERE IS A STEP-BY-STEP OVERVIEW OF THE FEHA HOUSING COMPLAINT PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA:</strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1310" id="footnote-ref-1310">[1310]</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4 class="step">File a Pre-Complaint Questionnaire.</h4>
<p class="text">First, you need to file a Pre-Complaint Questionnaire, Form DFEH-700-01 (English) or Form DFEH-700-01S (Spanish). A Pre-Complaint Questionnaire can be filed by you, the Director of DFEH, or a community organization. You can do this <em>online, by phone, or by mail. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: It’s important that you provide an up-to-date phone number where you can be reached!</em></strong></p>
<ol class="text"><em>Online:</em> Go to <a href="http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/">http://esq5.houdiniesq.com/dfeh/intake/</a>, create an account, log in, and fill out the Pre-Complaint Questionnaire. Alternatively, you can email your Pre-Complaint Questionnaire to <a href="mailto:contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov">contact.center@dfeh.ca.gov</a>.<em>By Phone:</em> Call the DFEH’s Communication Center at (800) 884-1684. If you have a hearing impairment, please call 800-884-1684 or TTY at (800) 700-2320 for service.<em>By mail:</em> Request a printed copy of the form through the DFEH website (<a href="http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/contact.htm">http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/contact.htm</a>). After you carefully fill out the questionnaire, you can send it to the DFEH office nearest you (see the list below for office locations):</ol>
<p class="address">DFEH—Elk Grove Office<br/>2218 Kausen Drive, S. 100<br/>Elk Grove, CA 95758DFEH—Bay Area Regional Office39141 Civic Center Drive, S. 250<br/>Fremont, CA 94538DFEH—Fresno Office1277 E.

<h4 class="step">Intake.</h4>
<p class="text">Within<em> 10 days</em> of receiving your Pre-Complaint Questionnaire, an investigator from the DFEH will contact you by telephone to conduct an intake interview. The investigator will ask you questions to collect facts about the possible discrimination.</p>
<h4 class="step">File the Formal Complaint.</h4>
<p class="text">If your complaint is accepted for investigation, the DFEH investigator will draft the complaint and ask for you or your representative to sign the complaint. This formal complaint is then served on the “Respondent” (the person or entity that who you have made the allegation against). The Respondent is required to answer the complaint and is given the opportunity to voluntarily resolve it. A no-fault resolution can be negotiated at any time during the complaint process.If there is also federal law that would protect you, then the formal complaint is also filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Note: HUD usually accepts DFEH’s findings with respect to the alleged discrimination.</p>
<h4 class="step">Investigation Period.</h4>
<p class="text">DFEH must investigate every case in a standard, timely manner.DFEH has the authority to take depositions, issue subpoenas and interrogatories and seek Temporary Restraining Orders when appropriate.If the investigative findings do not show a violation of the law, the DFEH will close the case. If the DFEH finds a violation, continue to STEP 5.</p>
<h4 class="step"><a id="FEHA_mediation"></a>Mediation (a.k.a. “Conciliation”)</h4>
<p class="text">If the DFEH’s investigation shows that there was a violation of fair housing law, then it will schedule formal mediation/ conciliation conferences between the DFEH’s representatives, you, and the responding landlord.During the mediation/conciliation conference, the DFEH presents information supporting its belief that there has been a violation and explores options to resolve the complaint.If formal mediation/conciliation fails, the DFEH will then have to decide whether or not to file a civil lawsuit.</p>
<ol class="text">Possible Outcome #1: If the DFEH determines that you have been discriminated against (that your complaint has “merit”), and that the discrimination cannot be resolved through mediation, the DEFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the landlord on your behalf. (Continue to STEP 6 below).Possible Outcome #2: If the DFEH decides not to file a lawsuit (or takes longer than <em>100 days</em> to file the lawsuit), the DFEH <em>must give you a written notice</em> with the following information: (1) DFEH’s decision regarding your complaint, (2) the reasons for the DFEH’s decision; (3) your right to sue the landlord directly in court (see PG. 471 below on how to file a civil lawsuit in court); and (3) a list resources for filing a civil lawsuit.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1311" id="footnote-ref-1311">[1311]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<h4 class="step">Litigation</h4>
<p class="text">If the DFEH decides to litigate the case, it will be heard in civil court. </p>
<h4 class="step">Court Remedies &amp; Possible Outcomes.</h4>
<p class="text">If the lawsuit is successful (meaning the court finds that the landlord discriminated against you), you may be awarded some or all of the following remedies: </p>
<ol class="text"><em>actual money damages</em> (to compensate you for your losses); <em>punitive damages</em> (to punish the landlord for committing illegal discrimination); <em>injunctive relief</em> (ordering the landlord to stop discriminating or take some other action, such as changing its screening procedures or providing you with housing); AND/OR <em>attorneys fees and costs</em> (to reimburse the DFEH or a private attorney for the costs of the lawsuit).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1312" id="footnote-ref-1312">[1312]</a></sup></sup></ol>
<p class="text">Below is a flowchart showing what happens when you file a DFEH complaint.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1313" id="footnote-ref-1313">[1313]</a></sup></sup> Remember: if HUD (the federal fair housing agency, see PG. 470) also has jurisdiction (legal authority) over your housing complaint, then the DFEH will also file your complaint with HUD at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="73.png"/></p>
<p><strong>OPTION 2: </strong></p>
<p><a id="File_complaint_HUD"></a><strong>FILING A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT WITH HUD.</strong></p>
<p class="text">The procedures and potential relief of filing an administrative complaint with HUD are basically the same as filing an administrative complaint with California’s DFEH (see PG. 467 on how to file state housing discrimination complaint with the DFEH). </p>
<h5 class="question">How much time do I have to file a complaint after the discriminatory act occurs?</h5>
<p class="address">You have <em>1 year</em> after the discriminatory practice occurs to file your complaint with HUD.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1314" id="footnote-ref-1314">[1314]</a></sup></sup></strong></span></p>
<h5 class="question">How long does HUD have to respond and investigate?</h5>
<p class="address">HUD has <em>100 days</em> to determine if there is “reasonable cause” to believe the discrimination occurred.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1315" id="footnote-ref-1315">[1315]</a></sup></sup></strong></span> Within these 100 days, HUD <em>must try to facilitate a conciliation agreement</em> (meaning an agreement that solves the problem) between you and the landlord who discriminated.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1316" id="footnote-ref-1316">[1316]</a></sup></sup></strong></span></p>
<h5 class="question">Will HUD ever give special treatment to my housing discrimination complaint over other ones? </h5>
<p><strong><em>* HUD gives special treatment in 2 types of cases:</em></strong></p>
<p class="address"><em>Special Case #1:</em> If HUD decides that a court must act quickly, it can refer your case to the U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ), which must then file a civil enforcement action for temporary or permanent injunctive relief pending a final disposition on the case.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1317" id="footnote-ref-1317">[1317]</a></sup></sup></strong></span> This civil action doesn’t stop the administrative proceedings; it just tries to create a solution more quickly when it’s deemed necessary.<em>Special Case #2:</em> If your complaint has to do with the legality or illegality of any <em>zoning or other land use law</em>, then HUD must refer it to the U.S. DOJ for civil prosecution.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1318" id="footnote-ref-1318">[1318]</a></sup></sup></strong></span> HUD must then file either a charge against the respondent, or dismiss the complaint.<span class="followedhyperlink"><strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1319" id="footnote-ref-1319">[1319]</a></sup></sup></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>OPTION 3: </strong><a id="File_civil_law_suit"></a><strong>YOU CAN FILE A CIVIL LAWSUIT DIRECTLY IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT—DEPENDING ON WHAT KINDS OF LEGAL VIOLATIONS YOU ARE ALLEGING.</strong></p>
<p class="text">You may file a civil state or federal lawsuit under <em>either </em>or <em>both</em> federal law (e.g., the FHA) and state law (e.g., the FEHA, the Unruh Act, or other laws). </p>
<ol class="text">Under federal Law: FHA and FEHA, you must file your lawsuit within 2 years of the discriminatory act itself OR within 2 years of the landlord violating a mediation/conciliation agreement that HUD or DFEH had facilitated for you (refer back to STEP 5 on PG. 469 above).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1320" id="footnote-ref-1320">[1320]</a></sup></sup> Under state law: California’s Unruh Act, there is not a clear deadline by when you must file the lawsuit, but it could be as short of a timeline as 1 year!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1321" id="footnote-ref-1321">[1321]</a></sup></sup> If you are able to do so, talk to an attorney about your options and timelines as soon as possible after the discrimination occurs (see a list of housing legal aid providers across California on PG. 1180). </ol>
<h5 class="question">What remedies are available to me in a state or federal lawsuit?</h5>
<p class="address">If the lawsuit is successful (meaning the judge finds that the landlord discriminated against you), you may be awarded some or all of the following remedies: </p>
<ol class="text"><em>actual money damages</em> (to compensate you for your losses); <em>punitive damages</em> (to punish the landlord for committing illegal discrimination); <em>injunctive relief</em> (ordering the landlord to stop discriminating or take some other action, such as changing its screening procedures or providing you with housing); AND/OR <em>attorney’s fees and costs</em> (to reimburse the DFEH or a private attorney for the costs of the lawsuit).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1322" id="footnote-ref-1322">[1322]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<p><strong>OPTION #4:<em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DOJ) or the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ) may also file a complaint—on the behalf of their government agencies OR on your behalf.</strong></p>
<p class="text">The U.S. DOJ may file a civil lawsuit in federal court if there is reasonable cause to believe that:</p>

<div class="questionheading">DOES MY CITY HAVE ADDITIONAL LOCAL PROTECTIONS? </div>
<p class="text">It may! If your city or county has <em>special protections</em> against housing discrimination of people with records, <em>or has local agencies</em> in charge of enforcing fair housing laws, then you may also want to bring your housing discrimination complaint to the city agency responsible for fair housing where you live. If you aren’t sure, you can always ask someone at the DFEH, or ask a local nonprofit housing attorney (see a list of legal aid organizations that may be able to assist you on PG. 1180). For example, the city of San Francisco, CA has a new law called the “Fair Chance Ordinance” that adds additional protections for people with criminal records who apply to live in <em>city-funded affordable housing</em> (which includes Below Market Rate or “BMR” units in private buildings in SF). Go to Appendix H, PG. 466 for information on the San Francisco law and the process of filing a complaint against a landlord or housing provider who has violated the law in San Francisco.</p>

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_AppI"></a>Rural development (RD) grievance procedures </div>
<p class="text">The grievance procedures for Rural Development (RD) housing are different from most other government-assisted housing programs. Here is an overview of how it works if you live in RD housing:</p>
<ol class="text">When a grievance is filed, regulations require the owner of the multifamily property (or owner’s representative) to offer to meet informally with the denied applicant within 10 calendar days to resolve the grievance. If the informal meeting fails to resolve the issue, the owner must file a report summarizing the problem to USDA (DEFINE THIS) and the applicant.The applicant (you) may submit a summary of the problem to USDA. After you get a summary of the problem, you must file a written request for an informal review hearing within 10 calendar days.After you request the informal review hearing, a hearing panel will be selected.You and the owner of the multifamily property may agree on a hearing officer, <em>or</em> you may each appoint one member of a 3-person panel, and those two hearing officers choose the third officer. If you and the owner <em>cannot agree within 30 days </em>on the two hearing officers, USDA will give you notice and appoint a person to act as the sole hearing officer.A USDA-approved ‘Standing Hearing Panel’ can also hear all grievances related to a particular development, where at least one member of the standing hearing panel must be selected by the residents at a formal resident meeting called to select hearing panel members.After the hearing panel is selected, the hearing will be scheduled within 15 days.</ol>

<div class="appendixtitle"><a id="HS_TOC_THPMA"></a>Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)</div>
<p class="text">It is very common to live in a transitional housing program after release from prison or jail. As described on PG. 365, transitional housing programs are <em>temporary</em> programs that offer <em>temporary</em> housing and services. They usually have requirements you have to meet before you can move in, and there are usually waitlists. Some transitional housing programs offer services like job training, counseling, GED programs, and computer classes. Some transitional housing programs are intended for people with specific needs such as mental illness, addiction treatment and recovery (see PG. 373), disabilities (PG. 453), or domestic violence support (see PG. 368).In this section, we explain a special law called the Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA). Just because you live in transitional housing does NOT mean that the THPMA applies to you, <em>so read carefully!</em></p>
<div class="questionheading">HOW CAN A transitional HOUSING PROVIDER REMOVE ME FROM MY HOUSING?</div>
<p class="text">AS A <a id="Formal_eviction_general_rule"></a>GENERAL RULE: If a resident and a transitional housing provider have an agreement for that person to live in the housing unit, the transitional housing provider MUST follow California’s formal eviction process in civil court (these cases are called “unlawful detainer” actions under the law). If a transitional housing provider removes you <em>without going through the formal court process</em>, that housing provider could be subject to legal liability. If possible, talk to an lawyer or advocate at a legal aid organization about your rights (see a list of legal aid organizations across California, beginning on PG. 1180).</p>
<p><strong>EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE—THE THPMA:</strong></p>
<p>The THPMA is a California state law and says owners of transitional housing can evict you more quickly than a normal eviction procedure ONLY IF the following 3 requirements are met:</p>
<ol class="text">You committed “participant misconduct or abuse”; 	You have lived in the transitional housing program for less than 6 months; ANDYou signed a WRITTEN CONTRACT with the transitional housing provider when entering the program that explicitly stated that the THPMA applied, with information about your rights and the procedure for using the THPMA to kick someone out more quickly.</ol>
<p><strong>WHAT IS A “TENANT”?</strong></p>
<p class="sidebox">A tenant is a person who lives on land or in a property that is rented from a landlord.</p>
<p>ALL of these factors need to be true, and most of the time, they are not, so REMEMBER—generally you have the same rights as a <em>tenant</em> facing eviction, which means usually a transitional housing provider has to go through the court process to evict (remove) you.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS considered A “<em>TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM</em>” UNDER THE THPMA?</div>
<p>Under the THPMA, a transitional housing program is <em>any </em>program designed to assist homeless persons to live independently in permanent housing with <em>all</em> the following components:</p>
<ol class="text">Residency requirements from 30 days to 24 months.Provides comprehensive social service programs incl. individualized case mgt. and may include other services such as alcohol/substance abuse counseling, self-improvement training, employment and training, and living skills.Provides temporary housing with structured setting and rules participants need to comply with to remain in program.</ol>
<p class="textbox">KEY DEFINITION: “Homeless person” = This law defines a homeless person as an individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate place to sleep at night, <em>or</em> lived in any temporary housing, shelter, or institution, which includes sites not ordinarily used or designed for regular sleeping. This definition also covers <em>any person living with</em> the transitional housing program participant.</p>
<div class="questionheading"><em>WHEN</em> MAY A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS AND EVICT me MORE QUICKLY THAN the normal eviction process?</div>
<p class="text">An operator may use the faster, expedited THPMA restraining order/injunction process only for (1) program misconduct, or (2) abuse, defined below.</p>
<ol class="text">Program misconduct—is an <em>intentional</em> violation of the transitional housing program’s rules and regulations. The intentional violation <em>must</em> “substantially interfere with the orderly operation of the program,” <em>and</em> involve one of the following acts:Drunkenness on site; Unlawful use or sale of drugs; Theft; Arson; Destruction of property (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site); orViolence or threat of violence and harassment (against the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).</ol>
<p><strong><em>OR</em></strong></p>
<ol class="text"><a id="THPMA_Abuse"></a>Abuse—is <em>intentionally or recklessly causing, or attempting to cause</em>, bodily injury or sexual assault; <em>or </em>placing someone else in reasonable fear of “imminent serious bodily injury” (against yourself, the operator, other program participants, employees, or people living within 100 feet of the program site).<em>Even in these situations, the transitional housing provider</em> may NOT use the expedited THPMA removal process against a participant in the program<em> for 6 months or more, UNLESS </em>a restraining order (permanent injunction) or temporary restraining order (TRO) is already pending or in force against you. If the operator hasn’t started a THPMA action within 6 months of your participation in the program, then the operator must either (1) go through the form eviction (“unlawful detainer”) court process, and/or (2) use a traditional civil harassment restraining order process to remove you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1327" id="footnote-ref-1327">[1327]</a></sup></sup></span></ol>
<div class="questionheading">HOW could A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR USE THE THPMA PROCESS?</div>
<p class="text">If the above requirements are all met, a transitional housing program operator may:</p>
<ol class="text">Use the formal eviction/”unlawful detainer” court process (see the GENERAL RULE on PG. 474—the THPMA gives the transitional housing owner two options for evicting someone); <em>OR</em>If program misconduct or abuse: Use the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)/injunction process under the THPMA.</ol>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE TRO PROCESS?</div>
<p class="text">The TRO process is a 2-step process:<strong>STEP 1:</strong> The transitional housing program operator must file an application for an <em>immediate temporary restraining order</em> (TRO) until a hearing can take place. This immediate TRO may include orders that you (the program participant) refrain from misconduct, <em>or</em> it may exclude you from participating and living at the transitional housing program site, and stay at least 200 feet away from the site of <em>abuse </em>(defined above, PG. 475) was alleged.<strong>STEP 2:</strong> There is a <em>hearing on permanent injunction</em>—usually within in 5 days of the program operator filing the TRO. For the judge to issue a permanent injunction (permanent restraining order) at the hearing, there must be <em>clear and convincing evidence</em> of program misconduct or abuse by the participant.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT ARE “STAY AWAY” AND “EXCLUSION” ORDERS, AND WHEN CAN A PROGRAM OPERATOR GET ONE AGAINST ME?</div>
<p class="text">These types of orders are defined below:</p>
<ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Exclusion Order:</span> An<em> exclusion order</em> says that you are not allowed to participate or live at the program site.<span class="emphasisitalic">Stay Away Order:</span> A stay away order says that you cannot be within 200 feet of the transitional housing program site or other program sites that it runs.</ol>
<p class="text">A transitional housing program operator may only ask for exclusion and stay away orders for “abuse,” NOT for “program misconduct” (defined above on PG. 475). These orders can last for up to <em>1 year after the hearing</em>, and the operator can ask the court to renew the restraining order after that (<em>NOTE:</em> the operator must ask for an extension of the exclusion or stay away order at least 3 months before the original one expires). The program operator may also be able to get an <em>immediate</em> exclusion or stay away order from the court in a temporary restraining order (TRO) hearing—but only if it’s an <em>emergency. </em>It can only be considered an emergency if it’s <em>necessary to protect</em> another participant, employee, or person living within 100 feet of the program site from “imminent serious bodily injury.”</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR GETS AN EXCLUSION OR “STAY AWAY” ORDER?</div>
<p class="text"><em>Before the hearing, through a TRO,</em> the transitional housing program operator may have you immediately removed from the unit.<em>After the hearing,</em> the transitional housing program operator may take immediate possession of the unit and consider it “abandoned.” If there are other people living in the unit (for example, your family members), but those other people were not named in the restraining order petition, then the program operator may <em>only remove you, and anyone actually named in the petition.</em> A copy of the order will also be given to the local police.</p>
<div class="questionheading">WHAT could happen IF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM OPERATOR <em>DOESN’T</em> GET AN EXCLUSION OR STAY AWAY ORDER?</div>
<p class="text">If you violate the conditions of the restraining order (also called a permanent injunction), the transitional housing program operator may:</p>
<ol class="text">Serve you with a 3-day “notice to quit”—meaning you have 3 days to get you and your belongings out of the transitional housing program; and after the 3 days are up, the operator can start a formal eviction process in court (an “unlawful detainer’ action – learn more about these eviction lawsuits on PG. 435 above).File a “contempt” action in court along with a request (called a “petition”) to modify the exiting restraining order to <em>include an exclusion order</em> (EVEN IF the original action was based only on “program misconduct”),Finally, if you “willfully disobey” the court’s restraining order, you could be charged and possibly convicted of a criminal misdemeanor.Below, we have copied the instructions from the California Courts for someone who is participating in a transitional housing program covered by the THPMA and who receives restraining order papers.<em> </em></ol>
<p><em>You can download all forms related to the THPMA on the California Superior Court’s website at </em><a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH">http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=TH</a>.</p>
<div class="questionheading">What STEPS does THE CALIFORNIA COURT suggest I TAKE IF YOU I’m being KICKED OUT OF TRANSITIONAL HOUSING UNDER THE Transitional Housing Participant Misconduct Act (THPMA)?</div>
<p class="text">The California Courts have published instructions for people who are facing removal from transitional housing under the THMPA. Those instructions are available on court form TH-210, available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/th210.pdf</a>, and also copied below for your reference.1. <strong>Legal advice.</strong> If you are served with an Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order ["OSC/TRO"] and a Petition, you should seek legal advice right away. The OSC/TRO should list the name, address, and phone number of the Legal Services Office in the county where the petition is filed. You may be able to get legal services by contacting this office. If you do not have an attorney, you can also call the attorney's referral service of your local bar association for help.2. <strong>Read the Instructions.</strong> Whether or not you choose to talk to an attorney, you should read all of these instructions and the other papers you have received.3. <strong>Obey the Order.</strong> Read the papers served on you very carefully. The Petition tells you what orders the program opera- tor is asking the court to make. The OSC/TRO tells you when to appear in court and may contain a temporary order telling you that you cannot do certain things. YOU HAVE TO OBEY THE ORDER. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE COURT'S ORDERS, CRIMINAL CHARGES MAY BE FILED AGAINST YOU. IF YOU ARE FOUND IN CONTEMPT OF COURT FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE COURT'S ORDERS, THE COURT CAN CHANGE THE ORDERS TO FORCE YOU TO MOVE OUT OF THE PROGRAM'S HOUSING.4. <strong>Review the facts.</strong> Read the description of the facts on the Petition very carefully. This is where the program operator tells the judge what he or she thinks happened. If you do not agree with the facts on the petition or you think it would not be fair for the court to grant orders against you, GO TO THE HEARING. The place and time of the hearing are on the first page of the form named "Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order."5. <strong>Respond to the court.</strong> If you want to fight the petition you should file a Participant's Response. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO FILE THIS FORM. A blank copy of the Response should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO. You can also file and serve statements signed by people who have personal knowledge of the facts. These are called "declarations." You can type these declarations on form MC-031 and attach them to your Response. If you do not know how to prepare a declaration, you should see an attorney.6. <strong>Serve a copy on program operator.</strong> After you have filed the Participant's Response with the superior court clerk, a copy must be delivered personally or by mail to the program operator or the program operator's attorney.You cannot serve the program operator yourself. Service may be made by a licensed process server, the sheriff's department, or any person 18 years of age or older, other than you. The person should complete and sign a Proof of Personal Service form. (A blank copy should have been given to you with the OSC/TRO.) You should take the completed form back to the court clerk or bring it with you to the hearing.7. <strong>Extensions.</strong> If you need more time to find an attorney or to prepare your Response, you must ask the judge for a continuance (extension) by the hearing date shown on the OSC/TRO.8. <strong>Opposing the Petition.</strong> If you wish to fight the lawsuit, you should file a Participant's Response and also go to the hearing. If you have any witnesses, they also must be present. If you do not attend the hearing, the court may make "permanent" orders against you that will last up to one year. If you can't file and serve a Response (or find an attorney who will), SHOW UP AT THE HEARING ANYWAY. At the hearing, explain your difficulties to the judge, and ask to be allowed to tell your side of the case.</p>
