  <p>
    I’m ready to take a GED test, how do I sign up?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re currently incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a federal prison: Ask your education advisor to sign you up. You should be able to take the test if the education staff thinks you’re ready based on your most recent assessment and/or your current work in class.[2703] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California state prison: First, sign up with your facility’s testing coordinator to take a GED predictor test. Depending on your score, you may be scheduled for the next available GED test date at your facility, or you may be enrolled in a GED preparation program for further study.[2704] Ask your correctional counselor or education department staff if you have questions about GED classes, VEP, or the GED predictor test.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a California county jail: Ask the education staff at your facility to sign you up to take the test the next time it is offered (if it is offered at your facility). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you’re formerly incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Create an online account at www.ged.com, and then sign up for a specific test date at a specific GED test center. To complete your registration, you must pay the fee ($35 per test module) using a credit card. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To find out what GED test centers are near you, call the GED Testing Service at 1-800-626-9433.[2705] If you have Internet access, you can also use the search tool on the GED Testing Service website,[2706] or visit the GED test center directory on the California Department of Education website at http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/gd/gedtestcntrs.asp.[2707] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    General Tips
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may want to register for just 1 or 2 test modules at a time if you can’t afford the full fee or if you want to give yourself time off between studying for the different subjects.[2708] To take the test in California, you must provide state-issued ID[2709] and proof of California residency.[2710] Before registering, ensure that you will have these documents on your test date. (You do not have to be a U.S. citizen or have a SSN to take the GED.[2711]) If you have more questions, contact the GED office at (916) 445-9438 or gedoffic@cde.ca.gov. If you have Internet access, you can also find information posted online by the California Department of Education[2712] and the GED Testing Service.[2713]

    Adult High School Diploma Programs

  <p>
    GED vs. High school diploma
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Compared to a GED program, which may focus on preparing you to answer test questions quickly, a high school diploma program requires you to complete many classes that are part of a high school education. Required course subjects include: English (reading, writing, literature); math (algebra, geometry); natural science (biology, ecology, physics); social science (history, civics, economics); humanities (art, religion); and electives (health, media literacy).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This section will help you decide whether an adult high school diploma program is a good option for you. You’ll also learn how to locate and sign up for an adult high school diploma program that meets your needs.
