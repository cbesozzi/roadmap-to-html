          <p><strong>Getting ID &amp; Other Key Documents, Voting &amp; Civic Participation</strong></p>
          <p><img src="12.png"/></p>
          <p class="description">The BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER explains how to access the building blocks of reentry including: how to get identification (ID) and other key documents, voting rights, and Selective Service registration. ID is proof of who you are — your identity. Government agencies, workplaces, service providers, schools, and other institutions issue ID cards for people who are members. You will want ID and other key documents so that you can participate in all the services that your community has to offer, so that you can legally drive, and so that you can prove who you are. Voting is another building block of reentry, so you will learn about your voting rights in this Chapter. Finally, Selective Service registration for the military is required of most men in the U.S., so you will learn why it is important to reentry in this Chapter.</p>
          <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>
