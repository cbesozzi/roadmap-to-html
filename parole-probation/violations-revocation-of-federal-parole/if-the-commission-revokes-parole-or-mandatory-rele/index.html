        <h3><a id="_Toc448153089"></a>If the commission revokes parole or mandatory release, does a parolee get any credit on the sentence for the time spent under supervision?</h3>
        <p>Generally, if you are convicted of a <em>new law violation</em>, you are entitled to credit for any of the time spent under supervision unless serving a Youth Corrections Act (YCA) or Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Act (NARA) commitment. </p>
        <p>Also, there is no credit given for any time a parolee intentionally failed to respond or report to a Probation Officer or after a parolee has absconded from his or her area and the Probation Officer did not know where he or she was living. For violation of any of the other noncriminal conditions, a parolee generally will be credited for all of the time spent under supervision in the community.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1013" id="footnote-ref-1013">[987]</a></sup></sup></p>
