            <p class="text">Yes. In California, employers are allowed to conduct background checks ‚Äúfor employment purposes‚Äù‚Äìwhen deciding whether to hire, promote, reassign, or keep you on as an employee. Private Background check companies are allowed to provide background checks (also called consumer reports) to anyone the agency reasonably believes will use the information ‚Äúfor employment purposes.‚Äù<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1793" id="footnote-ref-1793">[1763]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf an employer tells me that they will run a background check, should I still apply for the job?</h4>
            <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisheavy">Yes! </span>Even if the employer does run a background check, this doesn‚Äôt mean that they won‚Äôt hire you. 58% of employers allow job applicants to explain the results of their background check before the employer makes a final decision about whether or not to hire them.

            <h3><a id="_Toc448153417"></a>Can an employer consider my credit history?</h3>
            <p class="text">Generally, no.

            <ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report.</ul>

            <h3><a id="_Toc448153419"></a>Since employers are allowed to run background checks on me, do I have any legal rights in the process?</h3>
            <p class="text">Yes‚Äîyou have a number of important legal rights THROUGHOUT the hiring process in how the employer can run and use a background check. The following rules protect your rights when you are applying for a job and the employer runs a background check on you through a private Background check company. (Note: There are different rules if the employer runs a background check on a current employee because it suspects the person of misconduct or wrongdoing.)<sup><a href="#footnote-1806" id="footnote-ref-1806">[1776]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">Before an employer runs a background check on you using a private background check company, the employer must do ALL of the following: give you notice, get your written permission (consent) to run the check, inform you of your rights, and offer you a copy of the report, once it is done.<sup><a href="#footnote-1807" id="footnote-ref-1807">[1777]</a></sup> Here are the 4 steps below in more detail:</p>
            <h4 class="step">Give you ADVANCED, WRITTEN NOTICE</h4>
            <p class="text">An employer must provide you with written notice if it intends to hire a background check company and use information in your background check to make decisions related to your employment. This notice must be in a separate document from other information from the employer‚Äîit can‚Äôt just be mentioned on the job application or buried among other papers‚ÄîSO that it is clear that the employer is running a background check done on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1808" id="footnote-ref-1808">[1778]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">The NOTICE must include the following INFORMATION:<sup><a href="#footnote-1809" id="footnote-ref-1809">[1779]</a></sup></p>
            <ol class="text">Explain the purpose of the background check.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Explain that the background check may include information on your ‚Äúcharacter, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living‚Äù‚Äîmeaning certain personal information about you and your past.<sup><a href="#footnote-1810" id="footnote-ref-1810">[1780]</a></sup> </ol>
            <ol class="text">Give the name, address, phone number, and website of the private background check company that will conduct the background check. There are many background check companies out there, and you are entitled to know exactly which one is providing a report on you.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Explain your right to review the background check company‚Äôs files along with all the information the agency used when conducting your background check and preparing your background check report for the employer.<sup><a href="#footnote-1811" id="footnote-ref-1811">[1781]</a></sup> If the report will include information from interviews with your neighbors, friends, or associates, you must be given special notice.<sup><a href="#footnote-1812" id="footnote-ref-1812">[1782]</a></sup></ol>
            <h4 class="step">Get WRITTEN PERMISSION from YOU before they run the check: </h4>
            <p class="text">After the employer gives you notice, the employer must ask and get your permission in writing‚Äîbefore conducting a background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1813" id="footnote-ref-1813">[1783]</a></sup> Usually, there will be a box to check on the job application, asking you for your permission for the employer to do a background check.</p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If the employer wants to run another background check later‚Ä¶Employers must give you NOTICE and get your PERMISSION EVERY TIME they run a background check.If the employer wants to do another background check later, or wants to get continuous, updated background checks on you during your employment, they must give you a NEW NOTICE AND get NEW written PERMISSION from you each and every time they do a background check (except in cases of suspected misconduct).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1814" id="footnote-ref-1814">[1784]</a></sup></strong></p>
            <h4 class="step">Inform you of YOUR RIGHT TO SEE THE INFORMATION in your background check: </h4>
            <p class="text">The employer must inform you of your right to see the information used by the Background check company when conducting your background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1815" id="footnote-ref-1815">[1785]</a></sup></p>
            <h4 class="step">Offer you a COPY of your background check report:</h4>
            <p class="text">The employer must give you a chance to request a copy of the background check report they got. There should be a box you can check to request copy of your report‚Äîusually it will be on the same form you sign to give permission for the background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1816" id="footnote-ref-1816">[1786]</a></sup> Always check YES to get a copy of the report so you can see what the employer sees!</p>
            <p class="text">If you check the box to request a copy of your background check report, the employer must send you a copy of the report within 3 business days from the time when the employer receives it.<sup><a href="#footnote-1817" id="footnote-ref-1817">[1787]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: ALWAYS request a copy of the background check reportYou have a legal right to receive a copy of the background check report used by the employer, and it is recommended that you always request a copy of the report. Always check the box to request a copy of the background check report.</p>
            <ul class="importantbox">WHAT TO LOOK FOR<strong>: </strong>The box to request a copy of the background check report will probably say something like this: ‚ÄúCheck this box if you would like to receive a free copy of any consumer report or investigative consumer report obtained on you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am a California resident and I would like a free copy of my background check report.‚Äù<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1818" id="footnote-ref-1818">[1788]</a></sup></strong>Make sure you CHECK THIS BOX to request a copy of your background check report.</ul>

The employer must follow additional legal rules both before AND after taking any adverse action against you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1819" id="footnote-ref-1819">[1789]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc448153421"></a>What rules must an employer follow if they decide not to hire me based on my record?</h3>
            <p class="text">Under, federal law (FCRA) the employer must notify you both before AND after taking any adverse (negative) action against you based on the results of your background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1820" id="footnote-ref-1820">[1790]</a></sup> </p>
            <h4>BEFORE ADVERSE ACTION:</h4>
            <p class="text">Before an employer takes any adverse action against you based on the results of your background check, the employer must give you a ‚ÄúPre-Adverse Action‚Äù letter to notify you that it is planning to take the adverse action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1821" id="footnote-ref-1821">[1791]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">Under federal law, the Pre-Adverse Action letter must:</p>
            <ol class="text">NOTIFY you that the employer plans to take adverse action against you based on information from your background check report;</ol>
            <ol class="text">Include a COPY of your background check report that the employer used to make its decision,<sup><a href="#footnote-1822" id="footnote-ref-1822">[1792]</a></sup> and </ol>
            <ol class="text">Include the DOCUMENT, ‚ÄúA Summary of Your Rights Under FCRA‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-1823" id="footnote-ref-1823">[1793]</a></sup> (see Appendix¬†I, PG.¬†786)</ol>
            <p class="text">After you receive this letter, you must be given a reasonable opportunity (about 5 days)<sup><a href="#footnote-1824" id="footnote-ref-1824">[1794]</a></sup> to review your report and correct any errors. </p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you receive a ‚ÄúPre-Adverse Action‚Äù letter, you should:</p>
            <ul class="importantbox">Review your background check report immediately to make sure it does not contain any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated information‚Äîsuch as convictions that are more than 7 years old; convictions that were dismissed/expunged/sealed; and/or arrests that did not lead to a conviction (as long as the charges are not still pending); Tell the employer immediately if there is any incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information in the report;Offer proof of errors in your background check report, such as court records showing the final disposition (outcome) of the case;Offer proof of your rehabilitation efforts, including certifications or documents that show completion of programs, school transcripts, letters of support from past employer or other community members (not family or friends).</ul>
            <p class="importantbox">If the employer does not give you enough time to review the report and correct any errors‚Äîfor example, if the employer gives you the ‚ÄúPre-Adverse Action‚Äù letter and then rejects your job application on the same day‚Äîyou may have a legal claim against the employer for violating your right to receive notice before the adverse action.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1825" id="footnote-ref-1825">[1795]</a></sup></strong>IMPORTANT: Although the purpose of the Pre-Adverse Action law is to allow you to correct errors in your background check report, the law is NOT clear about whether the employer is required to reconsider your application if you correct the error and provide proof. If this happens to you, you should talk to an attorney about whether the employer may have violated your rights.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1826" id="footnote-ref-1826">[1796]</a></sup></strong> </p>
            <h4>AFTER ADVERSE ACTION</h4>
            <p class="text">After an employer takes any adverse action against you, such as rejecting your job application or firing you, the employer must give you an ‚Äú<a id="EM_AdverseActionNotice"></a>Adverse Action Notice‚Äù to notify you that an adverse action was taken against you based on information from your background check. The employer can give you this notice orally, in writing, or electronically, but it must be within 3 business days of the employer‚Äôs final decision. </p>
            <p class="text">Under federal law, the Adverse Action Notice must include:</p>
            <ol class="text">The name, address, and phone number of the background check company that supplied the report to the employer;</ol>
            <ol class="text">A statement that the background check company that supplied the report is not responsible for the adverse action and cannot explain the specific reasons for the action; and </ol>
            <ol class="text">A statement of your rights to: </ol>
            <ol class="text">Dispute (challenge) the accuracy or completeness of any information the background check company provided; and</ol>
            <ol class="text">Get an additional free report from the company within 60 days, if you ask for one.<sup><a href="#footnote-1827" id="footnote-ref-1827">[1797]</a></sup></ol>
            <p class="text">The Adverse Action Notice is important so that you know why the employer made the adverse decision against you and what information the employer considered. This way you can challenge or correct any information that is incorrect, incomplete, or illegal. And if the employer or background check company has NOT followed any of the laws described here‚Äîor if the employer does NOT give you an Adverse Action Notice‚Äîyou may have a legal claim against them. </p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Adverse Action NoticesIf an employer takes an adverse action against you (such as not hiring you) based on information in your background check report, they must give you BOTH a Pre-Adverse Action AND Adverse Action Notice. If the employer does not give you these documents, you may have a legal claim against them for violating your rights under background check laws. However, you will need to show that they employer‚Äôs decision was actually based on information in your background check report (such as your criminal record) and NOT for other reasons. See the text box immediately below on <a id="EM_HH_ShowEmployersDecisionWasBasedOnRec"></a>PG.¬†716 for how to do this.</p>

            <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf I did not receive a Pre-Adverse Action or Adverse Action Notice, how can I show that the employer rejected me based on my background check and NOT other reasons?</h4>
            <p class="textbox">Here are 2 strategies that have been used for showing that the employer may have rejected you based on your background check, even if they did NOT give you a Pre-Adverse Action or Adverse Action Notice:</p>
            <div class="textboxnumber">Did the employer say they would run a background check on you‚Äîeither in person, on the job posting, or on the job application? Did the employer give you a Notice saying they would run a background check, or have you sign a document giving them permission to run a background check? Did the employer give you a Pre-Adverse Action Notice but NOT Adverse Action Notice (or the opposite‚Äîan Adverse Action Notice but NOT Pre-Adverse Action Notice)? Did the employer say anything about your record, or about (not) hiring people with criminal records? Any of these can help show that the employer did run a background check on you, and may have rejected your application based on information in your background check.If you feel comfortable, you can try talking to the employer directly. You can explain that you are trying to improve your application for the future, and then ask why the employer did not select your application and what you can do to improve your chances in the future.In some cases, the employer may say something that reveals he/she made a decision based on your record or other information in your background check‚Äîfor example, a negative comment about your being trustworthy, creating a risk to others, or about people with criminal records, in general. If this happens, make sure that you write down afterward exactly what the employer said!In other cases, the employer may actually give you a helpful explanation that really can help you to improve your job applications in the future. This may show that the employer really did have some other reason for not hiring you, or at the very least can give you help you to be more successful for future jobs.Finally, the employer may not give you any explanation for their decision, or may simply say that other people were more qualified or applied before you. In this case, it may be difficult to show that the employer actually rejected you based on your background check report. </div>

            <p class="text">If there is inaccurate, incomplete, or illegal information in your background check report, you have the right to dispute (challenge) this information with the background check company that prepared the report.

            <h3><a id="_Toc448153423"></a>If I am hired, can my employer run background checks on me in the future without my permission?</h3>
            <p class="text">No. Under California state law, an employer must follow the legal procedure of giving you notice, getting permission, etc., every time it wants to run a background check on you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1829" id="footnote-ref-1829">[1799]</a></sup> In addition, an employer CANNOT ask you to waive (give up) your right to receive notice, give permission, etc., before running a background check.<sup><a href="#footnote-1830" id="footnote-ref-1830">[1800]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">EXCEPTION: If an employer suspects you of wrongdoing or misconduct, it can run a background check without giving you notice or asking for your permission. This exception applies if the employer is conducting a background check because they suspect you of misconduct on the job, including violating any written polices of the employer, or violating any federal, state, or local laws or regulations.<sup><a href="#footnote-1831" id="footnote-ref-1831">[1801]</a></sup></p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc448153424"></a>What can I do if the employer has already received information from a background check report that it shouldn‚Äôt have received by law?</h3>
            <p class="text">Unfortunately, employers sometimes get information that should NOT have been included in your background check report. They might ask you about it during an interview (or on a job application), or consider the information when deciding whether to hire you. Here are some suggested steps if this happens to you:</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 1: </strong>The first recommended step is that you get a copy of the background check report, so that you know what information the employer is seeing. For this reason, it‚Äôs important to always check the box to request a copy of the report when you give permission to an employer to run a background check on you.</p>
            <p class="text">If you didn‚Äôt check the box before, you can still get a copy of the report in 2 ways:</p>
            <ol class="text">If the employer decides take an adverse (negative) action against you‚Äîsuch as rejecting your job application‚Äîthey must give you a copy of the background check report before taking the action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1832" id="footnote-ref-1832">[1802]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">The background check company is required to give you a copy of the same report sent to the employer, if you ask for it within (at least) 2 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-1833" id="footnote-ref-1833">[1803]</a></sup></ol>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 2: </strong>If there are errors or inaccurate information on the background check report, it‚Äôs recommended that you point this out to the employer right away. If possible, you may also want to show the employer any proof of the correct information‚Äîfor example, court papers showing that your conviction has been expunged, or that charges against you were dismissed. </p>
            <p class="text">You also have the right to make the background check company correct the information, and send the employer a notice and statement of the correction. For more information on correcting information with the background check company and notifying the employer of the correction, see PG.¬†724 below.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 3:</strong> If the employer asks you about things that should NOT have been in your background check report‚Äîsuch as convictions that are more than 7 years old‚Äîit‚Äôs recommended you answer the question directly and honestly, but briefly:</p>
            <ol class="text">You can take responsibility for your actions. State the facts, but express regret for what happened. Don‚Äôt get defensive. Be honest, but don‚Äôt go into details. </ol>
            <ol class="text">You don‚Äôt need to go into details. Keep your answer short. Be honest, but only talk about necessary information based on the questions you are asked.</ol>
            <ol class="text">You can the employer how you have changed. Emphasize that the incident happened long ago and that you are a different person now. Explain what you learned while you were in prison/jail, and what you are doing differently now. Paint a picture of the person you are now. </ol>
            <ol class="text">You can emphasize your qualifications. Describe the things that will make you a good employee‚Äîsuch as previous work experience, job training programs, or classes that you‚Äôve done‚Äîand any letters of recommendation that you have. Show the employer why you are qualified for the position and will be a benefit to the company.</ol>
            <ol class="text">You can describe your hopes and dreams. Show the employer than you are in control of your life and have short-term and long-term goals. Highlight any services that you‚Äôre getting to help you move on and achieve your goals. Emphasize that you would be very appreciative of the opportunity to work for them, and you will be the hardest worker they will ever have.<sup><a href="#footnote-1834" id="footnote-ref-1834">[1804]</a></sup> </ol>
            <p class="text"><strong>STEP 4: </strong>If the employer asks you (or makes comments) about incorrect or improper information in your background check report, you may want to write down anything the employer says and anything you say to the employer, so that you have a record to protect your rights later.</p>
            <h4 class="textbox">know your rightsSummary of your rights if an employer runs a background check through a private background check company:</h4>
            <ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. You can ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report.</ul>

            <h4 class="textbox">know your rightsGeneral Overview of the Law &amp; your Rights</h4>
            <ul class="textbox">Instead of hiring a background check company, employers can also directly access your criminal record and other public records by conducting their own ‚Äúin-house‚Äù background check on you.Employers are NOT required to get your permission before running an in-house background check.You have the RIGHT to receive a COPY of any public information an employer is viewing. It is recommended that you NEVER give up this right!Your RAP sheet is generally confidential and NOT accessible by employers.Your RAP sheet is not the only place to find your criminal records, because most criminal records are public records.If an employer decides not to hire you based on information in a public record (including criminal court records), the employer MUST give you a COPY of the public records.An employer is NOT required to give you copies of any NON-public information used (such as information from talking to people who know you).</ul>
            <p class="text">Most employers hire an outside private background check company to gather public record information on job applicants and produce a background check report (this method of running a background check is covered in the previous section, starting on PG.¬†694).</p>
            <p class="text">However, instead of hiring an outside background check company, an employer can conduct its own ‚Äúin-house‚Äù (internal) background check on you. The employer can look at your public records directly, as well as interview your friends, family members, and former employers or co-workers. This ‚Äúin-house‚Äù type of background check is a less common practice, but it is important for you to understand that if an employer chooses this route, there are different legal protections than when a private company runs the background check. </p>

            <h3><a id="_Toc448153426"></a>How does an in-house background check work?</h3>
            <p class="text">An in-house background check is very similar to a third-party background check by an outside Background check company, except the employer alone is responsible for conducting the research, without any outside assistance.</p>
            <p class="text">Any employer may conduct an in-house background search in the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-1835" id="footnote-ref-1835">[1805]</a></sup></p>
            <ol class="text">Looking at public records, such as criminal convictions and civil judgments. You have a right to see any public records that the employer looked at; see PG.¬†720 below for more information.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Talking to friends, neighbors, former employers, or colleagues about your character, reputation, or living situation. The questions should be related to job skills, ability to work with others, attendance, attitude, and ability to follow instructions and receive criticism.</ol>
            <ol class="text">Verifying school records‚Äîyour attendance and any degrees you earned. However, employers cannot see your transcripts (courses and grades) or other school records (e.g., disciplinary records) unless you give written consent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1836" id="footnote-ref-1836">[1806]</a></sup></ol>
            <ol class="text">Online searches‚Äîlike searching for your name on Google, looking at your Facebook page, checking other social networking sites (Twitter, MySpace, etc.), and checking websites that post mug shots.<sup><a href="#footnote-1837" id="footnote-ref-1837">[1807]</a></sup> Note: An employer cannot ask you for your social networking username or password or make you show them your online profile.<sup><a href="#footnote-1838" id="footnote-ref-1838">[1808]</a></sup></ol>
            <h3><a id="_Toc448153427"></a>What rules govern California employers who run in-house checks? </h3>
            <p class="text">The law is more relaxed about in-house background checks than it is about outside background check companies‚Äô background checks. This means that you have fewer rights when it comes to being notified, giving your permission, and challenging the results of in-house background checks. </p>
            <p class="text">However, if an employer is running his/her own in-house background check on you, they still must follow certain rules. Here is what the employer is and isn‚Äôt legally required to do:</p>
            <ol class="text">The employer may request your permission, but it‚Äôs not required. Look carefully at the job application form‚Äîthe employer might ask to run an in-house background check right on the application form itself.</ol>
            <ol class="text">The employer must give you a copy of public records used in the report‚Äîunless you check the box to waive (give up) this right. Be careful‚Äîthe job application or other forms MAY have a box that you can check to waive (give up) your right to see the public records,<sup><a href="#footnote-1839" id="footnote-ref-1839">[1809]</a></sup> and it‚Äôs recommended that you do not check that box!</ol>
            <p class="importantbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: You can ALWAYS get a copy of PUBLIC RECORDS used by the employer. You have a legal right to get a copy of the public records used by the employer, and it‚Äôs recommended that you never give up (‚Äúwaive‚Äù) that right!<strong> </strong>It‚Äôs recommended that you always indicate that you DO want to see the public records report, and make sure you DON‚ÄôT check a box waiving your right. What to look out for: </p>
            <ul class="importantbox">The box to waive your rights will probably say something like this: ‚ÄúI further understand that the Company may obtain Public Records about me as part of an internal background investigation and that I may waive my right to receive a copy of such Public Records by checking the box to the right.‚Äù<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1840" id="footnote-ref-1840">[1810]</a></sup></strong> It‚Äôs recommended that you DON‚ÄôT CHECK THIS BOX!This can be confusing because it is the opposite of what happens when the employer hires a private background check company to do the background check (in which case <em>it is recommended </em>that you check the box to request a copy of the <em>background check report</em>).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1841" id="footnote-ref-1841">[1811]</a></sup></strong> </ul>
            <ol class="text">If you don‚Äôt waive your right to view the public records gathered about you, the employer must give you a copy of the public records within 7 days after it receives them.<sup><a href="#footnote-1842" id="footnote-ref-1842">[1812]</a></sup> </ol>
            <ol class="text">EXCEPTION: In California, if your existing or future employer wants to run an in-house background check because it suspects you of misconduct or wrongdoing, the employer is not required to reveal its findings until after the investigation is over. However, upon completion of the investigation, the employer must give you a copy of the public records unless you waived (gave up) your rights (so again, its recommended that you don‚Äôt give up your right to a copy of those public records!).<sup><a href="#footnote-1843" id="footnote-ref-1843">[1813]</a></sup> </ol>
            <ol class="text">If the employer takes any adverse (negative) action against you‚Äîsuch as deciding not to hire you‚Äîbecause of information in the public records, the employer must give you a copy of the public records even if you checked the box that waived your right to see the records.<sup><a href="#footnote-1844" id="footnote-ref-1844">[1814]</a></sup><br/>The employer is not required to give you information it gets from NON-PUBLIC sources, such as checking your references with past employers, verifying your education records, or talking to people who know you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1845" id="footnote-ref-1845">[1815]</a></sup> </ol>
            <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTImportant things to know about listing references and previous jobs</h4>
            <p class="textbox">When you apply for a job, the new employer will often contact your former employers and other people you list as references, in order to find out if you were a good employee and to decide if they should hire you. Keep in mind that a former employer CAN say negative things about you as part of a job reference even suspected criminal activity, regardless of whether you were convicted of anything‚Äîso long as they reasonably believe the information is true and they are not simply acting out of meanness towards you.Also, the new employer is NOT required to tell you what these people said about you, and they can say positive or negative things. It‚Äôs recommended that you check in with your references BEFORE listing them, so that you know what they will say about you. (You can also ask someone you trust‚Äîa case manager, social worker, legal aid attorney, or friend‚Äîto call for you.) Finally, the new employer will also check the dates when you worked at your previous jobs and how much you earned‚Äîso make sure you know the EXACT dates and amount you earned, or it could seem like you are being dishonest in a new job application. For more information about listing references and previous jobs on a job application, see PG.¬†700.</p>
