  <p>
    I’m ready for high school-level work. What are my options?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are two ways you can earn your high school degree: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Take a General Educational Development test to get your GED, OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Complete a high school diploma program. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have already completed several high school courses, you might want to earn the rest of the credits in a high school diploma program. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have not completed many (or any) high school courses, getting a GED may be an easier option. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: Both adult high school programs and GED classes are offered for free in federal prisons,[2674] California state prisons,[2675] and California county jails;[2676] and for low or cost free in adult school programs across the state.[2677] You will need to decide which pathway to a high school degree is best for you.
