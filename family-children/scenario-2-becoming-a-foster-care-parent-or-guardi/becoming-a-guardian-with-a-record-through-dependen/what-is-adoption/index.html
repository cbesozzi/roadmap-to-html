  <p>
    What is adoption?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adoption is the legal process of forming a legally recognized parent-child relationship when you are not the child's biological or birth parent. Adoptive parents have ALL the same legal rights and responsibilities that a biological parent would have had. That adoptive parent-child relationship is permanent and is seen as exactly the same as that of a birth family under the law. An adoptive parent can be a stepparent or domestic partner of one of the birth parents, a relative of the child who has been caring for the child, or someone unrelated to the child by blood. For more information on adoption and how to adopt a child, visit the following website: http://www.childsworld.ca.gov/pg1302.htm.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What is the background check process for potential adoptive parents? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyone who applies to adopt a child will have to provide a lot of documentation, including a state criminal record and fingerprints that will be run though the California Department of Justice’s (CA DOJ) state database and the FBI’s federal database.[2396]
