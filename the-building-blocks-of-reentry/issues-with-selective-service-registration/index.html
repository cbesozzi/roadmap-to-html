  Issues with Selective Service Registration
</p>

<p>
  I registered with the Selective Service, but I lost my registration number and my proof of registration. How can I get these? 
</p>

<p>
  Contact the Selective Service to request your number and get new proof of registration. Be ready to provide your name, birthdate, Social Security Number, AND current mailing address. TO CONTACT:
</p>

<p>
  By phone: Call 1-847-688-6888. 
</p>

<p>
  By mail: Mail a request to Selective Service System; P.O. Box 94638; Palatine, IL 60094-4638.
</p>

<p>
  Online: Visit http://www.sss.gov and click “Check Registration.” You’ll need to enter your SSN.
</p>

<p>
  It’s been more than 30 days since I turned 18, and I haven’t registered with the Selective Service. Can I still register? 
</p>

<p>
  IF YOU ARE AGE 25 OR YOUNGER, then YES, you can still register. You should do so immediately![299] To register, follow the steps listed above on PG. 91.
</p>

<p>
   IF YOU ARE AGE 26 OR OLDER, it’s probably too late to register. HOWEVER, if you have good reasons for not registering earlier — such as being incarcerated continuously between the ages of 18 and 25 — then you might be able to get an official “Status Information Letter” from the Selective Service stating that you were not required to register.[300] To learn how to request a Status Information Letter, go to PG. 93.
