  <h1>What benefits and services can I get through GA/GR?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125854"></a><a id="_Toc448153264"></a>What benefits and services can I get through GA/GR?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">It depends on your county.<em> </em>Every county offers different benefits and services through GA/GR, and every county sets its own specific rules. Generally, every county’s GA/GR program provides a monthly cash amount. But remember that the rules vary by county:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">Each county has its own rules for calculating a person’s monthly GA/GR amount—typically based on factors like whether you’re married, your housing situation, disabilities, ability to work, and ability to apply for other public benefits programs.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Some counties’ GA/GR programs provide help with: </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Transportation costs;</ol>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox">SPECIAL RULES &amp; RESTRICTIONS</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">Some counties may have special rules and restrictions for people with drug-related convictions or other violations, or people who are suspected of having a warrant, being in violation of parole or probation, or fleeing to avoid prosecution. For example, in Los Angeles County, you are ineligible for GA/GR if you are on house arrest. Other counties, such as San Francisco, make eligibility determinations on a case-by-case basis. </p>
  
  <ol class="text">Health care and nutrition needs;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Substance abuse treatment referrals;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Emergency food and housing;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Housing repairs; and/or</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Personal hygiene products.</ol>
  
  <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: GA or GR – a GRANT versus a LOANSome counties provide GA/GR cash as a “grant” (a gift), with no strings attached; other counties provide GA/GR as a “loan.” If your county treats GA/GR as a loan, you will have to pay it back if you have enough income to do so. Several counties require anyone who receives GA/GR, but is then later approved for Social Security Benefits, to repay GA/GR benefits. For more information on Social Security Benefits, see PG. 557. Also, many counties have rules that limit the number of months that you can get General Assistance/General Relief cash throughout the year.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125855"></a><a id="_Toc448153265"></a>How do I apply for GA/GR? </h3>
  
  <p class="text"><a id="_Toc290728746"></a>You must apply for General Assistance/General Relief in person. If you have a disability that stops you from going into the county welfare office, you can request help. Contact your county welfare agency for details about the application process in your county. For a directory of county welfare agencies, see Appendix A, PG. 634. Note that some counties accept GA/GR applications only at specific offices, so if you are unsure about which office to go to, you should call the main county welfare office and ask. </p>
  
  <p class="text">Note that you can apply for General Assistance/General Relief at the same time you apply for CalFresh (“food stamps”) and/or Medi-Cal (health insurance for low-income Californians), and it is usually a good idea to do so. Some counties may allow you to apply for General Assistance/General Relief upon release or at a community re-entry center. See PG. 522 for information on CalFresh and PG. 538 for information on Medi-Cal.</p>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125856"></a><a id="_Toc448153266"></a>Can I apply for GA/GR while incarcerated? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">No. You are not eligible to apply for GA/GR while in jail or prison. But remember that you may be eligible to apply once you are released.<sup><a href="#footnote-1371" id="footnote-ref-1371">[1341]</a></sup> If you are on house arrest, contact your county welfare agency to ask if you are eligible for GA/GR.<sup><a href="#footnote-1372" id="footnote-ref-1372">[1342]</a></sup> </p>
