    Why register to vote?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Voting is a way to participate in choosing the laws and the decision-makers in your community. Voting can also be a meaningful way to exercise your rights as a citizen, and an opportunity to express your political identity as a member of your city, county, state, and/or country.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a person with a criminal record, you may or may not have lost your right to vote. If you’re still able to vote, you may be deciding whether to exercise your right. If you’ve lost your right to vote and need to restore it, you may be deciding whether it’s worth the effort. Either way, voting rights are extremely important for ensuring each citizen has a voice — and yet states have absolute power to restrict or restore the voting rights of people with criminal records.[245]
