  <p>
    I have a prison or jail ID. Isn’t that enough to identify myself?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may already have a prison or jail ID card, but these generally are not enough to help you prove who you are in all the areas where you will need an official ID. At the start of your reentry, though, a prison or jail ID card may help you get other forms of ID. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What are the most important forms of ID to have? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NATURALIZED U.S. CITIZEN?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you were born outside the U.S. and then became a citizen, instead of a birth certificate, you need your naturalization certificate. For details, go to PG. 40.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As you rebuild your life in the community, there are 3 KEY DOCUMENTS for you to have: (1) your birth certificate; (2) your Social Security card (or number); and (3) a state ID or driver license (you don't need both, just one). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The most important forms of ID for you to have first are your birth certificate and Social Security number (SSN). Once you have these, you will be able to get a state ID card or a driver license, the most commonly used forms of ID for everyday purposes. Once in a while, you will need to show a copy of your Social Security card for certain services, but most of the time if you just know your Social Security number (SSN), that’s enough.
