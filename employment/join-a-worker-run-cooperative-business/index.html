  Join a worker-run cooperative business
</p>

<p>
  A worker cooperative is a business that is owned and controlled by its workers. In other words, the workers are both the employees AND the employer. Usually, workers run the day-to-day operations of the business—such as making business decisions, assigning tasks to each person, etc., as well as the business’s finances. Although each person has a different level of responsibility, all workers are considered to be equal members and have equal power within the business.
</p>

<p>
  Any business can be a worker-owned and controlled cooperative. Worker co-ops have been successful in many different industries. Some examples are:
</p>

<p>
  Service—housecleaning, day labor, restaurants, taxis, childcare
</p>

<p>
  Farming and food production—urban or community farms, community-supported agriculture programs, bakeries, restaurants
</p>

<p>
  Retail—grocery stores, bookstores, bike shops
</p>

<p>
  Health care—nursing, home health care, clinics, bodywork
</p>

<p>
  Skilled trades—printing, plumbing, woodworking, contracting
</p>

<p>
  Manufacturing and engineering—machine parts, fabricating
</p>

<p>
  Technology—web hosting, networking, voice and data systems
</p>

<p>
  Education—charter schools, teacher/student/parent-run schools
</p>

<p>
  Media and the arts—designers, galleries, performers, publishers
</p>
