          <p class="sidebox">Appendix E on PG. 989.</p>
          <p class="text">As stated in the family court section on PG. 922, You can show the judge anything that indicates that giving you custody or visitation will be in the best interests of your child. You can show the judge things like: certificates earned during incarceration, letters to and from your child, letters of support from family and friends, documents that show attendance in self-help groups, proof of employment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2396" id="footnote-ref-2396">[2364]</a></sup> However, if you have a conviction that automatically bans you from getting custody or visitation with your child, then mitigating evidence will not be considered. See PG. 894 for a list of convictions that will automatically bar you from getting custody or visitation.</p>
