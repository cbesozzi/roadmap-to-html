          <h3><a id="Expung_Part3_17bReduction_Benefits"></a><a id="_Toc448153929"></a>I want to get my felony “wobbler” expunged. What are the steps to getting it reduced to a misdeameanor so that it is then eligible for expungement?</h3>
          <p class="text">Having a felony conviction on your record (even after the conviction has been expunged) can be much more damaging than having only a misdemeanor. Reducing your felony “wobbler” conviction to a misdemeanor, whether or not you have it expunged, changes your criminal record so that—going forward—you no longer have a felony conviction on your record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3010" id="footnote-ref-3010">[2976]</a></sup></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">Here are the benefits of reducing your felony “wobbler” to a misdemeanor: </p>
          <ol class="text">You can say that you were never convicted of a felony when applying for most jobs, housing, public benefits, loans, etc.;<sup><a href="#footnote-3011" id="footnote-ref-3011">[2977]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You will no longer be disqualified from getting most professional and occupational licenses because of a felony conviction;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3012" id="footnote-ref-3012">[2978]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You may get back your <em>state</em> gun rights back;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3013" id="footnote-ref-3013">[2979]</a></sup></sup> AND</ol>
          <ol class="text">You will get back your right to serve on a jury.<sup><a href="#footnote-3014" id="footnote-ref-3014">[2980]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: <em>Felony Reductions &amp; Immigration Issues</em>: As of January 1, 2015, the maximum jail time that a person can be sentenced to for a misdemeanor is 364 days--one day short of a full year. This could have significant meaning for you if you are at risk of being deported because of a felony conviction, and your conviction can be reduced to a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17(b). When you get your felony conviction reduced, it is suggested that you ask the judge to say <em>on the record</em> that the maximum sentence for your conviction is now 364 days. This could possibly help you avoid certain negative immigration consequences that are tied to a sentence of 365 days or more.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3015" id="footnote-ref-3015">[2981]</a></sup></strong> It is recommended that you contact a lawyer immediately for help in this situation. The Immigrant Post-Conviction Relief Project, run by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, offers free help to people with immigration issues related to their criminal convictions. Contact the Lawyer’s Committee by phone at (415) 543-9444 or email at <a href="mailto:info@lccr.com">info@lccr.com</a>. </p>
