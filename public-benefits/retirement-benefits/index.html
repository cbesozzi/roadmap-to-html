  HOW TO CHECK FOR SOCIAL SECURITY CREDITS 
</p>

<p>
  If you’re not sure how many Social Security credits you have, you can call the SSA (1-800-772-1213), have a Form SSA-7004, “Request for Social Security Statement” sent to you, and submit the form. If you have Internet access, you can also use the Online Retirement Estimator on the SSA’s website by visiting www.ssa.gov.
</p>

<p>
  Social Security retirement benefits are paid out of money collected from Social Security taxes on individual paychecks to working taxpayers.[1528] For each year you work and pay Social Security taxes to the government, you earn “credits”—up to 4 per year. Generally, you need 40 credits (10 years of working and paying Social Security taxes) to qualify for retirement benefits.[1529]
