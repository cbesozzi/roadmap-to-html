          <h2 class="subheading"><a id="HS_VI_ChallengingDenials_GOVT"></a><a id="_Toc448153226"></a>Challenging Denials to Government-Assisted Housing</h2>
          <p class="textbox">This section will help you understand how to challenge a denial from a federal government-assisted housing program, and what to expect in the process. If you are denied government-assisted housing, you have the right to receive notice of the denial with the SPECIFIC REASONS for the denial—including anything that came up in your criminal records (see PG. 56 for what PHAs and government-assisted owners can access). You also have the right to a review of the denial—which could be a very informal meeting or hearing (see PG. 78 about what those look like) and the right to receive information on how to prepare for that informal hearing/review. You also have rights during the review hearing process AND the right to challenge the decision if you still disagree. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
