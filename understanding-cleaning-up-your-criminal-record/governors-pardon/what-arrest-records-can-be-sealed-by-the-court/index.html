  <h1>What arrest records can be sealed by the court?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153965"></a>What arrest records can be sealed by the court?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Any arrest that did NOT lead to a conviction is eligible to be sealed. You can ask to have your arrest record sealed if you were arrested, but: </p>
  
  <ol class="text">The DA NEVER filed charges against you in court;<sup><a href="#footnote-3154" id="footnote-ref-3154">[3118]</a></sup> OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The DA offered you a diversion program instead of filing charges (and you successfully completed it);<sup><a href="#footnote-3155" id="footnote-ref-3155">[3119]</a></sup> OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The DA filed charges against you, but the case was dismissed;<sup><a href="#footnote-3156" id="footnote-ref-3156">[3120]</a></sup> </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The DA filed charges, but the judge sent you to a diversion program instead (and you successfully completed it);<sup><a href="#footnote-3157" id="footnote-ref-3157">[3121]</a></sup> OR</ol>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox">what is “Factual innocence”?</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">“Factual innocence” means that “no reasonable cause exists” for a judge to think that you did what you were arrested for. It is a very high and difficult standard to meet. In most cases, even if your case was dismissed or you were acquitted by a jury, a judge is still not likely to find you “factually innocent<em>.</em>” Examples of factual innocence include: the police arrested you because they thought you were someone else; what you did was not actually illegal; or your arrest was the result of police misconduct.</p>
  
  <ol class="text">The DA filed charges against you, but you were acquitted at trial;<sup><a href="#footnote-3158" id="footnote-ref-3158">[3122]</a></sup> </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The DA filed charges, you were <em>convicted</em> at trial, but the judge set aside your conviction.</ol>
