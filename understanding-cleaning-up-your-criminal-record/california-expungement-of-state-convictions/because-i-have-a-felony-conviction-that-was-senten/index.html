  <h3><a id="Expung_Part2_CAExpung_RealignmentFelony"></a><a id="_Toc448153917"></a>Because I have a felony conviction that was sentenced to county jail under Realignment instead of state prison, can i get it expunged?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Maybe. If you were convicted of a felony and sentenced to county jail instead of state prison (called a “<em>County Jail Felony</em>”) under California’s Realignment Act,<sup><a href="#footnote-2959" id="footnote-ref-2959">[2925]</a></sup> you may be eligible for expungement under California’s newest expungement law.<sup><a href="#footnote-2960" id="footnote-ref-2960">[2926]</a></sup> This law is specifically intended for people who were sentenced under Realignment. </p>
  
  <p class="text">To be eligible for expungement of your Realignment felony, you must:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">Have served your entire sentence in county jail—NOT state prison;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Have completed your entire sentence—including any probation or community supervision;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Paid all of your fines and fees; AND</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Not have any new charges pending, not be serving a sentence on a new case, and not be on probation for another case.</ol>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">What is a SPLIT sentence vs. a STRAIGHT sentence?</h4>
  
  <p class="textbox">Under California’s Realignment Act, people who are sentenced to county jail instead of prison for felony convictions, can be sentenced in two ways:</p>
  
  <ul class="textbox"><strong>Straight sentence</strong>—a person is sentenced to serve their entire sentence in custody. When they are released, they have completed their entire sentence and are not required to serve any term of supervision.<strong>Split sentence</strong>—a person is sentenced to spend a portion of their time in custody and the remainder under community supervision (mandatory supervision). </ul>
  
  <p class="text">Additionally, BEFORE you can get your conviction expunged, you must wait a certain amount of time after completing your sentence:</p>
  
  <ol class="text">If you had a split sentence, you must wait 1 year after the completion of your sentence.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If you had a straight sentence, you must wait 2 years after the completion of your sentence.<sup><a href="#footnote-2961" id="footnote-ref-2961">[2927]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <p class="text">Finally, expungement under this statute is entirely discretionary, meaning it is <em>up to the judge to decide</em> whether or not your conviction should be expunged. For this reason, you should be prepared to bring any <em>evidence</em> you can to show the judge that <em>you deserve to have your conviction expunged</em>. (For more information on discretionary expungements, see PG. 1168.)</p>
  
  <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: What an expungement will NOT do. Even if you have your Realignment “AB 109” felony expunged:</p>
  
  <ul class="importantbox">It will still count as a “<em>prior</em>” conviction in a future criminal case;<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2962" id="footnote-ref-2962">[2928]</a></sup></strong>You still have to <em>report</em> it as a conviction to <em>occupational licensing agencies</em> and on applications for job positions in a government office;<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2963" id="footnote-ref-2963">[2929]</a></sup></strong> It does NOT restore your <em>gun rights</em>, so you can still be charged under “felon in possession” criminal laws;<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2964" id="footnote-ref-2964">[2930]</a></sup></strong> It does NOT restore your right to hold a job in <em>public (government) office</em> (if you lost this right due to your conviction).<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2965" id="footnote-ref-2965">[2931]</a></sup></strong></ul>
