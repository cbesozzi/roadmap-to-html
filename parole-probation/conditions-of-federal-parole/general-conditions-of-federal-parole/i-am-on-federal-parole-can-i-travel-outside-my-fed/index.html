  <p>
    I am on federal parole. Can I travel outside my federal parole district?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes, if you get permission from your Probation Officer and/or the Parole Commission first.[929]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your Probation Officer may give you permission to travel outside your federal parole district without approval of the U.S. Parole Commission in the following situations:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Vacation trips for 30 days or less.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Trips to look into certain employment possibilities for 30 days or less.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Repeated travel across a district boundary, no more than 50 miles outside the district, for a job, shopping, or recreation.[930]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the following types of travel, you must (1) get the Parole Commission’s advance permission in writing, and (2) show a substantial need for such travel:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All foreign travel;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A job that requires you to repeatedly travel more than 50 miles outside your federal parole district (except offshore job locations); and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Vacation travel outside the district for more than 30 days.[931]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A special condition imposed by the Regional Commissioner prohibiting certain travel shall supersede any of the above general rules.[932] This means that if you have a special condition that prohibits certain travel then you will not be able to travel even if you meet the conditions above.
