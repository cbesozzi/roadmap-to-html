  <ol class="text">Your DNA was collected after you were arrested BUT NO charges were ever filed against you; OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Your DNA was collected after you were arrested and charges were filed against you, but the charges were dismissed, or you were acquitted; OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Your DNA was collected after you were arrested and criminal charges were filed against you, BUT your conviction was overturned;</ol>
  
  <p class="text">AND </p>
  
  <ol class="text">You have NO felony convictions (or juvenile felony adjudications) on your criminal record. (NOTE: Even if you get your felony conviction expunged or reduced to a misdemeanor, it will still count as a felony for purposes of DNA collection, so you will NOT qualify to have your DNA expunged from the database.);<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3219" id="footnote-ref-3219">[3183]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
  
  <p class="text">AND</p>
  
  <ol class="text">You are NOT required to register as a sex or arson offender.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3220" id="footnote-ref-3220">[3184]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <p class="text">If you meet all of the legal requirements, your DNA MUST be expunged from the database once you submit your request for expungement.</p>
