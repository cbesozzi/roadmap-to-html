        <h3><a id="_Toc448153243"></a>I am facing an eviction. What are my options?</h3>
        <p class="text">Since responding to an eviction notice can be VERY time-sensitive, it’s important to respond and act fast! Keep reading this section to learn more. It can also be VERY HELPFUL to have a lawyer assist you. <em>If you need a lawyer to help with defending against an eviction, see the list of housing legal aid providers on PG. 1286 for organizations that may be able to assist you.</em></p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153244"></a>I received a 3-day notice to do something from my landlord. Can I be evicted because of this notice?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1293" id="footnote-ref-1293">[1263]</a></sup></strong></h3>
        <p class="text">There are different kinds of “3-Day” notices. Most 3-Day notices can be corrected without having to actually move out of your apartment or home. The most common is the 3-Day notice “to pay rent or quit.” A landlord can give other kinds of 3-Day notices, as well. Another common one is the notice that says the tenant (the person living in the apartment who is on the lease) has created a nuisance or has done something which is not allowed under the rules of the lease agreement. All of these notices must be <em>in writing.</em></p>
        <h4>THE 3-DAY NOTICE TO “PAY RENT OR QUIT”:</h4>
        <p class="text">If your rent is late or not paid in full, the landlord may give you a notice called a “Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.” The landlord cannot give you this notice until the rent is late. This notice must be in writing.</p>
