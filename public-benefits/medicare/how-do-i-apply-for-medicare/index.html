          <h3><a id="_Toc290125910"></a><a id="_Toc448153324"></a>How do I apply for Medicare?</h3>
          <p class="text"><strong><em>If you’re currently incarcerated:</em></strong> Read the next question (PG. 550) to learn how to apply. </p>
          <p class="text"><strong><em>If you are not incarcerated and have never been enrolled in Medicare:</em></strong> Read on for details related to your situation:</p>
          <ol class="text">If you’re approaching age 65:</ol>
          <ol class="text">And already getting Social Security benefits: you’ll automatically get Parts A and B when you turn 65. About 3 months before you turn 65, you’ll get your Medicare card by mail. If you want Part D as well, you must sign up for that separately by calling 1-800-MEDICARE.<sup><a href="#footnote-1518" id="footnote-ref-1518">[1488]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">And NOT<em> </em>getting Social Security benefits (see PG. 557): you should apply for Medicare by contacting the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778).<sup><a href="#footnote-1519" id="footnote-ref-1519">[1489]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you’re under 65 and have a disability:</ol>
          <ol class="text">And you’re already getting disability benefits from Social Security; you’ll automatically get Parts A and B after 24 months of disability benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1520" id="footnote-ref-1520">[1490]</a></sup> In the 25<sup>th</sup> month, you’ll get your Medicare card by mail. If you want Part D as well you must sign up separately by calling 1-800-MEDICARE.<sup><a href="#footnote-1521" id="footnote-ref-1521">[1491]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">And you’re not getting disability benefits from Social Security, you should apply for SSDI (see PG. 583 for details).</ol>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125911"></a><a id="_Toc448153325"></a><a id="PublicBenefits_Medicare_Incarcerated"></a>Can I apply for Medicare while incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">Yes! If you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare while incarcerated, you should contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) to enroll in Parts A and B. Unlike people who are not in custody, you will NOT be automatically enrolled—so you need to take action. Although Medicare won’t start paying for your health care until you’re released, it’s important to get enrolled as soon as you can. This way, you avoid getting charged penalties for late enrollment, and you also ensure that your Medicare is ready as soon as you’re out.</p>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">When:</span> Contact the SSA to get enrolled during the 7-month period surrounding your 65<sup>th</sup> birthday—the month of your birthday, plus 3 months before, and 3 months following. This is called your Initial Enrollment Period (“IEP”). Supposing that you turn 65 on April 10, 2015, your Initial Enrollment Period would run from January 1, 2015 through July 31, 2015. If you don’t enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period, you may not have access to health care for months after you’re released; and you may get charged penalties if you try to enroll in Medicare later.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">How:</span> Send a signed and dated letter to the Social Security Administration. The letter should include your full name, Social Security Number, a clear statement that you want to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, and the date that your coverage should be effective. Make sure you sign the letter. Keep a copy of your letter and a copy of the envelope—and, if possible, send the letter by certified mail with return receipt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1522" id="footnote-ref-1522">[1492]</a></sup> </ol>
          <h3><a id="_Toc290125912"></a><a id="_Toc448153326"></a>I had Medicare when I entered prison or jail. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">All your Medicare benefits get suspended (paused) while you’re incarcerated. The rules for staying enrolled and restarting your benefits upon release are different for each Part of Medicare.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1523" id="footnote-ref-1523">[1493]</a></sup></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><em>&gt; Your Part A (hospital insurance) enrollment stays in place. </em>Although you won’t get Part A benefits while incarcerated, you don’t have to do anything to stay enrolled. When you’re released, your access to Part A benefits should be automatically restored.<sup><a href="#footnote-1524" id="footnote-ref-1524">[1494]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text"><em>&gt; Your Part B (medical insurance) is more complicated, since you can only stay enrolled by paying premiums.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1525" id="footnote-ref-1525">[1495]</a></sup></p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">MUST ENROLL FOR PART B PREMIMUMS AFTER INCARCERATION!</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">If you’ve been getting Social Security or SSDI, these benefits have been paying for your Part B premiums. Once you’ve been incarcerated for 30 days, these benefits get suspended; so you must call 1-800-MEDICARE within that 30-day window and set up direct payment if you want to keep Part B. </p>
          <ol class="text">If you keep paying premiums, you’ll stay enrolled, although you won’t get Medicare benefits while incarcerated.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If you stop paying premiums, your coverage will be ended; and for every 12 months that pass before you re-enroll, your premium amount will be higher by 10%.<sup><a href="#footnote-1526" id="footnote-ref-1526">[1496]</a></sup> Also, you can re-enroll in Part B only during the General Enrollment Period (“GEP”), which runs January through March, and coverage starts July 1 of the year that you enroll. Depending on your release date, this may cause a gap in your medical coverage.<sup><a href="#footnote-1527" id="footnote-ref-1527">[1497]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text">These rules create a dilemma if you’re someone who can’t afford to keep paying Part B premiums while incarcerated, and won’t be able to afford higher premiums upon release. If you were on Medicare and SSDI before incarceration, you may be able to address this dilemma by applying for SSDI while incarcerated (see PG. 617).</p>
          <p class="text"><em>&gt; Your Part C (Medicare Advantage plan) and Part D (prescription drug plan) will end when you’re incarcerated. </em>You’re no longer eligible to be enrolled in these plans while the prison or jail is providing your health care. If you want Part C and/or Part D after release, you’ll have to re-enroll (for details, see PG. 551).<sup><a href="#footnote-1528" id="footnote-ref-1528">[1498]</a></sup></p>
