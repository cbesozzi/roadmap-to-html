    What if I was born in the U.S.A., but there is no record of my birth?

    If you request a copy of your birth certificate from the state or county where you were born, but you receive a notice that there is no record available, you will have to locate a secondary record of your birth to serve the same identifying purpose as a birth certificate does. Secondary records are not considered as reliable as authorized certified birth certificates, but they can still help you prove your identity to obtain other forms of ID. Secondary records include:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hospital records;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Census record;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Religious records confirming your birth date (such as a baptism certificate or family bible record);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Statement from the midwife who delivered you;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Early school records; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Records of immunization.[30]
