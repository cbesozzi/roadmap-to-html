  <p>
    Can my criminal history limit my ability to get SSI?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possibly—but this could be just temporary. You can’t get SSI for any month that you:[1624]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are confined in a correctional facility for that full calendar month; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Have an outstanding arrest warrant because you’re avoiding prosecution or confinement for a felony; or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are found to be violating a condition of probation or parole.[1625] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is an example of how this works: If you went to jail on October 30, 2014 until November 2, 2014, you weren’t entitled to SSI benefits for the months of October or November.[1626] This means you can’t collect “back payments” for SSI benefits that you would have received if you never had a violation, warrant, and/or period of confinement as described in the three situations above.[1627] Additionally, your benefits will be paused for up to one year. After that, they will be ended and you will need to re-apply (see PG. 616 below).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also, you can’t apply for any Social Security benefits based on a disability that is related to a felony you committed. For example, if you fell while committing a felony and lost your ability to walk as a result, that disability won’t qualify you for SSI.[1628] But you could still apply for SSI based on a disability that has no connection to your felony.
