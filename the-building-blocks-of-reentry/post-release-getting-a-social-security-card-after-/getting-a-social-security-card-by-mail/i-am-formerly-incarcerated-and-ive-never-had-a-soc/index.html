          <h1>I am formerly incarcerated, and I’ve never had a SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN). How do I get an original SSN AND card?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc328831267"></a>I am formerly incarcerated, and I’ve never had a SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN). How do I get an <a id="SSC_OriginalCard"></a>original SSN AND card?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you have never had a Social Security number (SSN)—meaning you were never assigned one at any point in your life—you need to apply for an original number. The process is similar to the process for getting a replacement card, but <em>it must be done in person</em>, and <em>the ID requirement is stricter.</em></p>
          <h4 class="step">Gather the identifying documents you will need. </h4>
          <p class="text">To get your SSN, you must prove your identity (a process called “enumeration”) with proof of:</p>
          <ol class="text">(1) your age; (2) your U.S. citizenship or legal presence; and (3) your identity.<sup><a href="#footnote-54" id="footnote-ref-54">[54]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">For an <strong><em>original SSN</em></strong>, you <em>must</em> bring more than one document to prove this information (not just one primary ID document). However, the types of ID documents you can use as proof are the same as for getting a replacement card (see PG. 44).<sup><a href="#footnote-55" id="footnote-ref-55">[55]</a></sup> Some documents carry more weight than others: an authorized certified birth certificate (or proof of naturalization, hospital record, or religious record) will be the most important. Remember, the SSA Field Office reviewer has to decide that you are who you claim to be. Give him or her every reason to believe so, and bring as much proof as possible.</p>
          <h4 class="step">Find your local Social Security Administration Field Office or Card Center. </h4>
          <p class="text">Go to the website <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp">https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp</a> to locate a local SSA Field Office.</p>
          <h4 class="step">Go to your local SSA Field Office or Card Center and fill out the application (Form SS-5).Meet with an SSA employee to verify your identity. </h4>
          <p class="text">Bring with you everything that could help prove who you are — even family members who can vouch for you (they must bring valid ID for themselves)! An SSA Field Office reviewer will interview you and review all the documents you bring. Depending on what you provide, the reviewer may ask for additional evidence of your age, citizenship/legal presence, or identity.<sup><a href="#footnote-56" id="footnote-ref-56">[56]</a></sup> The reviewer will enter all of your documentation into the SSA’s electronic application system.<sup><a href="#footnote-57" id="footnote-ref-57">[57]</a></sup> Generally, if the reviewer believes your documents are authentic and that you are who you say you are, your completed electronic application will be sent to a central office, and you’ll be issued a Social Security card within about 2 weeks. If your information needs to be verified, the process can take several weeks or months.<sup><a href="#footnote-58" id="footnote-ref-58">[58]</a></sup> </p>
          <h3>I BELIEVE MY IDENTITY WAS STOLEN WHILE I WAS INCARCERATED. WHAT CAN I DO?</h3>
          <p class="text">If you believe your identity was stolen while you were incarcerated and you are a resident of California, you can file an Identity Theft Affidavit by mail to the California Franchise Tax Board or call their ID Theft experts at 916-485-7088.<sup><a href="#footnote-59" id="footnote-ref-59">[59]</a></sup> <strong>If you are still incarcerated</strong>, you will likely need the help of a friend or loved one outside the prison to make calls and advocate on your behalf. <strong>If you are not incarcerated</strong>, you can access the Federal Trade Commission’s free manual, <em>Identity Theft: A Recovery Plan</em>, which contains a step-by-step procedure to handling identity theft, at http://IdentityTheft.gov.<sup><a href="#footnote-60" id="footnote-ref-60">[60]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">To file an Identity Theft Affidavit, you will need identifying documentation, such as a driver’s license or passport. You can find out how to get these documents on [page #] and [page #]. You can find a copy of the Identity Theft Affidavit in the Appendix section of the Identification &amp; Voting Rights Chapter on [page #].</p>
          <p class="text">You can also call the three major credit bureaus, listed below, to get a 90-day block. A 90-day block will stop anyone from opening an account in your name, but will expire automatically after 90 days.<sup><a href="#footnote-61" id="footnote-ref-61">[61]</a></sup> You will not need to provide a copy of your driver’s license to have a 90-day block put on, but will need your Social Security Number. For information on obtaining your Social Security Number, go to PG. 44.</p>

          <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN?</h4>
          <ul class="learn-bullets">The difference between a State ID and Driver License, and how to decide which will be most useful to youHow to apply for a State ID if you:Have never been issued a California IDHave an expired California ID Are currently incarcerated How to apply for a duplicate card if you know you have a non-expired California ID but misplaced the original card How to get the DMV to reduce your application fee for a California ID, if you are eligible How to get a valid ID or Driver License if you are undocumented How to get a new California Driver License What to do if you have an expired California Driver License What to do if you have a Driver License from another state How to find out if your license has been suspended or revoked and, if so, what you can do about itWhat happens when you have an outstanding traffic ticket in another state</ul>
          <p class="text">A <em>state ID card</em> and a <em>Driver License</em> are the most commonly used forms of identification for most people in their daily lives. In California, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues both of these documents. The major difference between these two forms of ID is that a California state ID card can be used <em>only</em> for<em> identification </em>purposes, but does not permit you to drive a car. A California driver license can be used for <em>identification</em> AND permits you to <em>drive</em> a car.<sup><a href="#footnote-62" id="footnote-ref-62">[62]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">Once you have an authorized copy of your birth certificate (PG. 32) and know your Social Security number (SSN) (PG. 41), you have what you need to apply for a California state ID card or a California driver license. </p>
