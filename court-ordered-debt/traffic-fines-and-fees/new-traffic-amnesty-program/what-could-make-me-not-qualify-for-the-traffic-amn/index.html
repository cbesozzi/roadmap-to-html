  <p>
    What could make me NOT qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are some tickets that do not qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program.[2197] For example, parking tickets,[2198] DUIs,[2199] and reckless driving tickets (like road-rage, speeding, racing, etc.),[2200] are NOT eligible for the Traffic Amnesty Program.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Additionally, you are not eligible to participate if you owe restitution (money damages) on any case in the county where the traffic violation was filed.[2201] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are also not eligible for the program if you have any outstanding misdemeanor or felony warrants in the same county where the ticket(s) was issued.[2202]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT WARNING FOR PEOPLE WITH OPEN WARRANTS: f there’s ANY possibility that you might have an outstanding warrant for your arrest—for ANY reason (including new charges against you or a failure to appear in court) from ANY county—it is recommended that you call the public defender or a private lawyer to check on your warrant status first, before trying to see if you are eligible for the Traffic Amnesty Program. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What kind of help can I get through the Traffic Amnesty Program?[2203] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    > You may be eligible to have BOTH your traffic court fines reduced on a ticket (by 50% or 80% depending on your income) AND get your CA driver license reinstated if . . .
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have an unpaid ticket that is covered by the program, and your fines were originally due to be paid on or before January 1, 2013; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have not made any payment on your ticket after September 30, 2015.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PAYMENT PLAN OPTION: It is important to note that the amount your fines will be reduced depends on your income.[2204] If you cannot afford to pay the full amount of the fine, even after the reduction, you can sign up for a monthly payment plan option.[2205] The payment plan will be based on your ability to pay the fine. If you receive public benefits or are very low-income, make sure to have written proof of this before applying! More information about payment plans will be posted to the California Courts’ website here: http://www.courts.ca.gov/trafficamnesty.htm.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    > You may be able to just get your California driver license reinstated (but not reduce the fines you owe on a ticket) if . . .
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You sign up and comply with a payment plan (including paying any court fees, which can be added to your balance and paid over time through the payment plan); OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You made a payment on your ticket after September 30, 2015. [2206]
