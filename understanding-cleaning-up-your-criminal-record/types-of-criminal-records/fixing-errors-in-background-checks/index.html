              <ol class="text">First, you can NOTIFY the background check company that the information is wrong and include proof (documents or evidence) of the correct information. </ol>
              <ol class="text">Second, the background check company MUST INVESTIGATE the information that you challenged, and MUST inform you of the results within 30 days.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Third, the background check company MUST REMOVE or CORRECT any information that is wrong, incomplete, or cannot be confirmed as true. </ol>
              <ol class="text">Finally, if the background check company does not remove the information from your background check, you can add your own STATEMENT OF DISPUTE to the company’s file stating that you disagree with the information.<sup><a href="#footnote-2904" id="footnote-ref-2904">[2870]</a></sup>.</ol>
              <p class="text">For a step-by-step explanation of this process, see APPENDIX H, on PG. 1222.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2905" id="footnote-ref-2905">[2871]</a></sup></sup></p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153889"></a>How do I know which background check company did my background check?</h3>
              <p class="text">There are two ways to find out which background check company ran your report and how to contact them:</p>
              <ol class="text">BEFORE someone runs a background check on you (such as an employer, private landlord, or creditor), generally they must TELL YOU that they are going to get a background check on you and get your PERMISSION. They must also give you the name, address, phone number, and website of the background check company that they are going to use.<sup><a href="#footnote-2906" id="footnote-ref-2906">[2872]</a></sup></ol>
              <ol class="text">If someone takes a harmful action against you (such as refusing to hire you, rent you an apartment, or give you benefits) based on information in your background check, they must give you an “ADVERSE ACTION LETTER” with the name, address, and phone number of the company used.<sup><a href="#footnote-2907" id="footnote-ref-2907">[2873]</a></sup> </ol>
              <p class="text">You have the right to know what internal procedures the background company uses to investigate your claim. You can ask the company for this information and they MUST provide it to you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2908" id="footnote-ref-2908">[2874]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>A NOTE ABOUT CHALLENGING INFORMATION IN YOUR BACKGROUND CHECK REPORT:</strong> Under the law, you have the right to challenge any information in your background check, and there is a specific process for doing it. However, in practice, it might not be as easy or straightforward, especially if the background check company is uncooperative or unresponsive. If you have trouble getting the company to review or change the wrong information in your file, it is recommended that you contact a lawyer for help. </p>
              <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="_Toc448153890"></a>WARRANTS</h3>
              <h3>What is a warrant and why is it important?</h3>
              <p class="text">Generally, a warrant is a legal order that gives law enforcement the authority to arrest you for various reasons, such as you missed a criminal court date or are suspected of a crime.  If you have an outstanding warrant this  means that the police can take you into custody at any time – including during a routine traffic stop, at your home, or when you appear in court for another matter. If you do not take care of the warrant, you will constantly have to worry that you may unexpectedly be taken to jail. For this reason, it is important to determine whether or not you have any outstanding warrants before getting your criminal record expunged. (See PG. X)</p>
              <p class="text">Additionally, if you have an outstanding warrant, it could impact other areas of your life, such as your ability to get public benefits, public housing, or a passport. </p>
              <h3>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT WARRANTS I might HAVE ON MY RECORD?</h3>
              <p class="text"><strong>Arrest Warrant:  </strong>An arrest warrant is issued after a grand jury or law enforcement officials have probable cause to suspect that you have committed a crime. Probable cause is a reasonable belief that something illegal took place.<sup><a href="#footnote-2909" id="footnote-ref-2909">[2875]</a></sup>  A judge will issue an arrest warrant for you if the judge determines a crime has been committed and that “there is reasonable ground to believe” that you committed the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-2910" id="footnote-ref-2910">[2876]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Bench Warrant</strong>:  A bench warrant is the most common warrant issued in California. It is typically issued when a person fails to appear for a court hearing or fails to answer a subpoena. A bench warrant can be issued for the following reasons:</p>
              <p class="text">Failure to pay a fine;</p>
              <p class="text">Failure to appear after an indictment on criminal charges where the court has a fixed date and place for an appearance by the defendant;</p>
              <p class="text">Failure to appear in court after an attorney and judge personally order the defendant to appear;</p>
              <p class="text">Failure to appear in court and show proof of enrollment, progress or completion of community service or other alternative sentencing; and</p>
              <p class="text">Failure to appear (FTA) in court after citation by police officer.</p>
              <p class="text">A bench warrant gives police the authority to automatically arrest someone. If you are arrested on a bench warrant a bail amount will be set. This means you likely will sit in jail until you appear in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-2911" id="footnote-ref-2911">[2877]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text">In serious criminal cases, a failure to appear will most likely cause the court to issue a “regular” arrest warrant, which means the police may immediately try to find and jail the defendant. A bench warrant, on the other hand, usually doesn’t trigger immediate police action. Instead, your name goes into a statewide computer system that serves the entire law enforcement community. Once your name is in the database, if you have to deal with the police for any reason – even when you’re not at fault – you can (and likely will) be taken into custody for the outstanding bench warrant.<sup><a href="#footnote-2912" id="footnote-ref-2912">[2878]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Parole Warrant</strong>:  If you don't meet your parole agent when you're supposed to, the agent can have a warrant issued. If you're considered a potential threat to public safety, the California Parole Apprehension Team will be sent to find you. A warrant can also be issued if the Board of Parole Hearings determines that you have violated your parole terms. </p>
              <p class="text">In practice, not all parole violations are serious enough to get your parole revoked. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has developed a Parole Violation Decision Making Instrument to help parole agents determine whether parole should be revoked or not. If the agent recommends that your parole should be revoked, the Board of Parole Hearings can issue a warrant. <sup><a href="#footnote-2913" id="footnote-ref-2913">[2879]</a></sup></p>
              <h3>HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT?</h3>
              <p class="text">One way to know whether you have an outstanding warrant is to search for your city, county, or state's official website and look for a link for a warrant search. You will know it is an official government website if it ends in .gov. </p>
              <p class="text">A court website may have a searchable public records section with information about outstanding warrants available to the general public. You can do a search on your name and the website will bring up any warrants under that name.  Please note that not every city, county, or state will have this option on their website. If the government entities have small budgets or low population there is a good chance the warrant online search option may not be available.<sup><a href="#footnote-2914" id="footnote-ref-2914">[2880]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text"> <br/>If the website doesn’t have a searchable public records section, you can call the clerk of court or county clerk.  When you call the clerk of the court, ask if there is an outstanding warrant for “Person X” (your name) in a criminal or civil case. Have your name, birth date, and if possible, your case number and Social Security number, in hand. Avoid identifying yourself as the person for whom a warrant was issued. You should not have trouble getting an answer about a criminal case, since most data in criminal cases are public records.<br/></p>
              <h3>HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT IN A FEDERAL CASE?</h3>
              <p class="text">If you want to know whether you have an outstanding warrant in a federal case, call the federal clerk of court for your district. If you are uneasy about calling the clerk of court yourself, you can have another person call for you. This can be a friend, relative, attorney, or bail bondsman. </p>
              <p class="text">Another option is to go to the courthouse and look up your name in their public records, which are usually filed on computers. If it's possible, have another person do this for you - if you have an outstanding warrant, you risk being taken into custody by the courthouse's security officers.</p>
              <p class="text">You may have multiple outstanding warrants out for your arrest in different federal circuits. The clerk of court for one circuit may not be able to tell you whether you have an warrant in another circuit. Consider working with a bail bondsman or an attorney to determine if you have multiple warrants.</p>
              <h3>HOW DO I FIND OUT IF I HAVE A PAROLE WARRANT?</h3>
              <p class="text">Your relationship with your parole agent is key to staying out of prison. If you have missed a meeting, the first thing you should do is to call your parole office and ask your parole agent for instructions. </p>
              <p class="text">You can reach the office for California's Northern Region at 916-255-2758 and the Southern Region office at 909-468-2300. These offices should be able to give you the phone number for your local parole office in northern or southern California if you don't already have it.</p>
              <p class="text">If you think a warrant has already been issued, you can call the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at 916-445-6713.  </p>
              <h3>I FOUND OUT I HAVE AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT. WHAT CAN I DO?</h3>
              <p class="text">If you have an outstanding warrant, you have a few options. Depending on what the warrant is for, you may be able to take care of it by simply showing up in court and paying a fine. The court clerk may be able to tell you what you need to do to take care of the warrant. You should check with a lawyer before you show up at the courthouse though, as you risk being taken into custody when you identify yourself there. </p>
              <p class="text">In some cases, it is better to have a lawyer take care of the warrant for you. If you don't take care of your warrant, you risk being taken into custody the next time you come in contact with the police. Police contact during traffic stops which result in arrests for warrants are very common. Call a lawyer to make sure this doesn't happen to you. <br/></p>

            <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/understanding-cleaning-up-your-criminal-record/types-of-criminal-records/fixing-errors-in-background-checks/what-is-a-credit-report-and-whats-the-difference-b/">What is a credit report? And what’s the difference between a RAP sheet and a credit report?</a></h2>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448153891"></a>What is a credit report? And what’s the difference between a RAP sheet and a credit report?</h3>
              <p class="text">In California, a credit report is different from a background check and is covered by a different set of laws.<sup><a href="#footnote-2915" id="footnote-ref-2915">[2881]</a></sup> A credit report contains information about your money and finances—including debts you owe (such as unpaid bills, loans, or leases), your payment history for past bills and debts, and the status of your credit accounts. Your credit report does NOT include your criminal history or other personal information about you. For this reason, this legal guide does not go into detail about the laws governing credit reports.</p>
            </article>
          
            <article>
            <h2><a href="/roadmap-to-html/understanding-cleaning-up-your-criminal-record/types-of-criminal-records/fixing-errors-in-background-checks/will-my-credit-report-be-included-in-my-background/">Will my credit report be included in my background check?</a></h2>
              <h3><a id="_Toc448153892"></a>Will my credit report be included in my background check?</h3>
              <p class="text">Generally, no. Background check companies are NOT allowed to include your credit report in your regular background check, because not everyone who is allowed to see your background check is also allowed to see your credit report. When companies run your credit report, they must follow a separate set of rules that are specific to credit reports, which are not covered in this guide. The only time that your credit report and background check will be together is when someone who is <em>ALLOWED to see both</em> requests them together (for example, a landlord can request both at the same time, but most employers cannot see your <em>credit</em> report, just your criminal background check).<sup><a href="#footnote-2916" id="footnote-ref-2916">[2882]</a></sup> </p>
              <h3>HOW DO I GET A COPY OF MY CREDIT REPORT WHILE I’M INCARCERATED?</h3>
              <p class="text">You must mail in a request for your free credit report to the following address:</p>
              <p class="text">Annual Credit Report Request Service<br/>PO Box 105281<br/>Atlanta, GA 30348</p>
              <p class="text"><br/>Include your full name, date of birth, Social Security Number and any addresses used in the last two years in a letter stating that you are requesting a free credit report. To find out how to obtain your Social Security Number, see [PG. XX]</p>
              <p class="text"><em>NOTE: </em>When this guide refers to background checks or background check reports, it means information about your <em>criminal history</em> (and certain other personal information)—but NOT your credit report.

              <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_WhoCanRunBackgroundCheck"></a><a id="_Toc448153895"></a>Who is legally allowed to run a background check on me?</h3>
              <p class="text">Unlike a RAP sheet, many more people (for housing, employments, bank loans, public benefits, etc.) can run a private background check on you, but it is still protected from showing everything in most cases. In California, state and federal laws<sup><a href="#footnote-2922" id="footnote-ref-2922">[2888]</a></sup> allow background check companies to run background checks and send the information…</p>
              <ol class="text">To anyone making decisions about you for: employment, renting a house/apartment, professional licensing, government benefits, credit obligations,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2923" id="footnote-ref-2923">[2889]</a></sup></sup> court-ordered child support or alimony, or insurance;</ol>
              <ol class="text">To establish child support requirements; </ol>
              <ol class="text">In response to a court order or subpoena;</ol>
              <ol class="text">To anyone with a legitimate business need for the report (for example, a bank, creditor, or someone you have a business relationship with);<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2924" id="footnote-ref-2924">[2890]</a></sup></sup>or</ol>
              <ol class="text">To the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Administration.</ol>
              <p class="text">Basically, the main people who can—and are likely to—run a background check on you are employers, private landlords, insurance companies, licensing boards and agencies, and financial institutions. </p>
              <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, there are LIMITS on what information can be included in your background check. In general, <em>cleaning up your record</em> means that the information may no longer show up in the background checks that <em>most</em> people—like ordinary employers and private landlords—can get.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153896"></a>Is there any other way that someone can see my criminal history?</h3>
              <p class="text">Yes. Because most criminal records and criminal case information is technically public, people in the general public could access on their own most legal paperwork filed in court or with a government agency. For example, anyone can go to the local courthouse, look up your criminal case and make copies of the documents in the court file. </p>
              <p class="text">But it is very unlikely that most people would go down to the courthouse to look you up for an apartment or job! Keep in mind that the information is likely scattered across hundreds of locations, so someone would really have to know exactly what they are looking for to actually find it. That’s why most people use professional background check companies to do the investigating for them—and that’s why these companies and the background checks they create are regulated by state and federal laws to protect you! </p>

              <p class="text">If you have ever been arrested or had a conviction in another state, or for a federal offense, you will want to get a copy of your FBI (federal) RAP sheet (also called your “Identity History Summary.” </p>
              <p class="text">There are two ways to get a copy of your FBI RAP sheet:</p>
              <ol class="text">You can request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI; OR</ol>
              <ol class="text">You can use a special private company, called a “Channeler,” that has contracted with the FBI to perform this service.</ol>
              <p class="text">NOTE: It is generally faster to go through an FBI Channeler, but it is likely to be more expensive because these companies usually charge extra fees.</p>
              <p class="text">Whether you request your RAP sheet directly from the FBI or go through a channeler, you will need to fill out the FBI’s “Applicant Information Form” and get fingerprinted by a Live Scan service provider.

              <p class="text">The process for getting your local RAP sheet is different in each county. In some counties, you can get a complete RAP sheet that has ALL of your criminal history information from that county in one place, including all of your convictions, arrests, and any open warrants. In other counties, these records are kept separately (by different agencies), so you will need to go to several places and get separate records for all of your court cases (convictions), arrest records, and warrants. </p>
              <p class="text">You will need to contact the police department, sheriff’s department, courthouse, or Public Defender’s Office of the county where you were convicted for information on how to get your local RAP sheet. </p>
              <p class="importantbox">Remember, your county RAP sheet and other records will ONLY show information for <em>that county</em>. If you’ve had any interaction with the police, courts, highway patrol, or any other law enforcement or criminal justice agencies in other counties, you should get your California (DOJ) RAP sheet to see all of your criminal history information.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153901"></a>How do I get a copy of my background check?</h3>
              <p class="text">The best way to find out what information might show up in your background check is to get your own background check done <em>on yourself</em>. </p>
              <p class="text">There are 2 ways to do this:</p>
              <p class="normal1"><strong>OPTION 1</strong>: <strong>Pay a <em>reputable</em> background check company to run a report on you.</strong></p>
              <p class="text">There are MANY private background check companies out there—you can search online for “background checks” or check your local Yellow Pages under “Investigators.” Beware, however, some background check companies are scams. Look up or call a few different companies to see what they offer and how much they charge. Avoid companies that seem to charge much more or much less than others.</p>
              <p class="normal1"><strong>OPTION 2: Request a background check report.</strong></p>
              <p class="text">Under federal and state law, you are entitled to get a FREE copy of your background check once every 12 months from any background check company.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2926" id="footnote-ref-2926">[2892]</a></sup></sup> To get a copy of your background check for free, you must confirm <em>in writing</em> that <em>1 of the following </em>is true: </p>
              <ol class="text">You are unemployed and intend to look for work within the next 60 days; </ol>
              <ol class="text">You receive public benefits (government assistance such as CalFresh or General Assistance); OR</ol>
              <ol class="text">You believe there may be errors in your report because you have been the victim of fraud or identity theft.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2927" id="footnote-ref-2927">[2893]</a></sup></sup></ol>
              <p class="text">Send a letter to whichever background check company you choose stating that you fall into one of the above categories (and list which category), and that you would like to request your free background check. </p>
              <p class="text">Legitimate agencies should not hesitate when you ask for your free report and should offer to run it right away. </p>
              <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER, your background check is different from your credit report, but you are entitled to both for free once every 12 months. </p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153903"></a>Why could it be helpful to “clean up” my criminal record?</h3>
              <p class="text">In general, <em>cleaning up your criminal record</em> can reduce many of the damaging effects associated with having a criminal history: </p>
              <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record can hide criminal records from certain people who run background checks on you—meaning most private employers, private landlords, and other private individuals or companies will NOT be able to see much of the information in your record.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record may allow you to say that you were never convicted of a particular offense; and/or may restore many of the rights that you lost because of a conviction (for example, voting rights, right to sit on a jury service, gun rights, etc.)</ol>
              <ol class="text">Cleaning up your record can reduce or remove the legal restrictions that prevent you from getting certain jobs and professional licenses.</ol>
              <p class="text">Cleaning up your record will make it easier to rebuild your life, move forward, and maximize your opportunities for success in the future. The first step toward cleaning up your criminal record is understanding the different types of records you may have and the information that may be in them.</p>

              <p class="text">Like most other questions about cleaning your record, this will depend on the specific details of your situation, including the type of registration requirement you have, your conviction offense, and which of these “remedies” you use to clean up your record. Certain remedies can remove your registration requirement, while others will NOT affect your registration requirement at all, so you will still have to register. For more information about which “cleaning remedies” DO and DON’T affect your registration requirements, see PG. 1202.</p>

              <ol class="text">You can correct errors, fill in incomplete information, or add missing information in your record (see PG. 1141 to learn about fixing errors in your RAP sheet, and see PG. 1146 to learn about fixing errors in a background check);</ol>

              <ol class="text">You may be able to get your felony conviction reduced (see PG. 1174), or reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor (see PG. 1178);</ol>
              <ol class="text">You may be eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (see PG. 1184);</ol>

              <ol class="text">Whether you were ordered to serve time on probation (formal and informal probation are treated the same in your record);</ol>

              <ol class="text">Whether you were ordered to pay any restitution, court fines or penalties, or administrative fees, and how much (learn more about these in the COURT-ORDERED DEBT CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 811); and</ol>

              <p class="text">You will need this information for two reasons:</p>
              <ol class="text">The information in your record will help you (and your lawyer, if you have one) <em>decide which remedies you are eligible for</em> (allowed to get), based on your criminal history (such as expungement, reclassification, dismissal, Certificate of Rehabilitation, or pardon); AND</ol>
              <ol class="text">To request the remedy you want, you (or your lawyer) will need to <em>fill out forms for the court or agency</em>. You will need <em>detailed information </em>from your criminal record in order to fill out these forms.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2929" id="footnote-ref-2929">[2895]</a></sup></sup></ol>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153907"></a>Where do I get this information for expungement?</h3>
              <p class="text">The best way to get this information is from your RAP sheet. You will need the RAP sheet that has information on ALL of your convictions.</p>
              <p class="text"><em>Choose the RAP sheet that has information on ALL of your cases:</em></p>
              <ol class="text">Your local (county) RAP sheet will list only your cases <em>in that county</em>, so only use this if ALL of your cases are from the SAME COUNTY (or if you only have 1 case). For information on getting your local county RAP sheet, see PG. 1155.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Your California (DOJ) RAP sheet will list all of your cases in <em>California</em>, so use this if ALL of your cases are from the state of CALIFORNIA only. For instructions on how to get your DOJ RAP sheet, see APPENDIX A, on PG. 1208.)</ol>
              <ol class="text">Your FBI (federal) RAP sheet will list all of your cases from EVERY STATE as well as FEDERAL offenses. Use this if you have cases from more than one state or any federal convictions. For instructions on how to get your FBI RAP sheet, see APPENDIX D, on PG. 1215.</ol>
              <p class="text">You may <em>also</em> be able to get information on a case from the following sources:</p>
              <ol class="text"><em>Your court papers from your case</em>.</ol>
              <ol class="text">BUT court papers will <em>only</em> contain information about <em>that particular case</em>. If you have multiple cases, especially if they are from different counties, it may be easier to get a copy of your full California RAP sheet (or FBI RAP sheet, if you also have federal or out-of-state cases). </ol>
              <ol class="text"><em>Your lawyer, parole agent, probation officer, or other people at the courts or law enforcement agencies</em>. </ol>
              <ol class="text">BUT these people may only have <em>limited information</em> about your case, or may have information about <em>1 case but NOT others</em>, so it’s better to go through the formal channels of getting your full RAP sheet.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><em>The criminal court where your case was decided</em>. </ol>
              <ol class="text">BUT the court will <em>only</em> have information for <em>cases from that county</em> and NOT other counties. If you only have cases from 1 county, make sure you get copies of ALL of your court papers for ALL of your cases in that county.</ol>
              <p class="text">Now that you have your criminal records and you know what’s in them, you are ready to begin cleaning them up!</p>
