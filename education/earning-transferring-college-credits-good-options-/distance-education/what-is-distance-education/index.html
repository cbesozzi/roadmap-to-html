    What is Distance Education?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Distance Education (also called Distance Learning) is an education program that uses various technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the teacher. It is a way for students to take a formal course of study (high school, vocational, or college-level) without having to travel to the classroom. Although the students and the teachers are separated, the hallmark of Distance Education is regular and substantial interaction between them.[2793] Distance Education courses usually incorporate multiple forms of media, including printed materials, CDs or DVDs, audio recordings, telephone communication, audio or video conferencing, email, and Web-casts and Internet streaming. There are two types of Distance Education interaction modes: “synchronous” and “asynchronous” instruction.[2794]
