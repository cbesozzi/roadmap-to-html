          <h1>Who has to register as a sex offender?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc352861035"></a>Who has to register as a sex offender?</h3>
          <p class="text">Here we discuss three situations in which you would be required to register as a sex offender in California:</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 1:</strong> You must register as a sex offender if you have ever been convicted of any crime listed in California Penal Code section 290(c). Cal. Penal Code section 290(c) includes a wide range of felony and misdemeanor offenses including forcible sex crimes against adults, most sex crimes involving children, prostitution and child pornography-related crimes, kidnap or assault for the purpose of committing a sex crime, soliciting another person to commit a sex offense, and attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the included crimes.<sup><a href="#footnote-457" id="footnote-ref-457">[456]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 2:</strong> You can also be required to register based on convictions for crimes that are not listed in § 290(c) if you committed the crime “as a result of sexual compulsion or for purposes of sexual gratification.” <sup><a href="#footnote-458" id="footnote-ref-458">[457]</a></sup> This determination is made by the judge when you are convicted or sentenced for the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-459" id="footnote-ref-459">[458]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text"><strong>SITUATION 3:</strong> Even if you were not convicted of a qualifying sex crime, you will be required to register if you meet any of the following criteria:</p>
          <ol class="text">You were adjudicated (found guilty) as a ward in juvenile court for certain sex offenses and committed to the CDCR Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) (formerly the California Youth Authority or CYA) or the equivalent agency in another state;<sup><a href="#footnote-460" id="footnote-ref-460">[459]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You have been found <em>not guilty by reason of insanity</em> of any offense listed in Cal. Penal Code § 290(c);<sup><a href="#footnote-461" id="footnote-ref-461">[460]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You have ever been found to be a Mentally Disordered Sex Offender (MDSO) or Sexually Violent Predator (SVP);<sup><a href="#footnote-462" id="footnote-ref-462">[461]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You have been convicted in another state or in a federal or military court of an offense that has the same elements as one of the offenses listed in Cal. Penal Code § 290(c).<sup><a href="#footnote-463" id="footnote-ref-463">[462]</a></sup> Also, if you are required to register as a sex offender in another state, you are almost certainly required to register with California law enforcement when you are in California.<sup><a href="#footnote-464" id="footnote-ref-464">[463]</a></sup></ol>
