  <p>
    What is California state parole?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In California, parole is a condition of release for a person coming out of prison.[330] It applies only to people convicted of a state felony and sentenced to state prison. State parole takes effect only after you are released from prison.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    People on parole — sometimes called “parolees” — remain under the control of CDCR. Within CDCR, parolees are more specifically under the control of the Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO), a division of CDCR. As a parolee, you are supervised by CDCR parole agents, and you must satisfy certain rules or “conditions” of parole.[331]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am incarcerated in A California state prison and preparing for release. Will I be required to serve a parole term after my release?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possibly, depending on your specific situation and the type of offense you committed. If you are incarcerated in a California state prison, you must serve a parole term after release if any of the following apply:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your current prison term is for a serious felony as defined in Cal. Penal Code § 1192.7(c);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your current prison term is for a violent felony as defined in Cal. Penal Code § 667.5(c);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You were sentenced as a “three-striker” under Cal. Penal Code §§ 667(b)-(i) or 1170.12(c)(2); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are classified by CDCR as a “high-risk sex offender,” regardless of your commitment offense; OR 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are found to be a “mentally disordered offender” (MDO) under Cal. Penal Code § 2962.2.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: If you don't fall into any of these categories, you are likely on a new form of supervision called post-release community supervision (PRCS). To learn more about PRCS, go to PG. 218. If you think you will be on state parole, not on PRCS, see the earlier section on state parole, on PG. 162.
