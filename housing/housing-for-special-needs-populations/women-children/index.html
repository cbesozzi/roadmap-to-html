          <h1>Women & Children</h1>
          <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="Special_needs_Women"></a><a id="_Toc448153116"></a>Women &amp; Children</h3>
          <p class="text">There are some special housing programs available only for women and their children. These programs may have other requirements (for example, that you are currently on supervision, participating in a substance abuse recovery program, etc.), and they may require a referral from CDCR or another agency.</p>
          <p class="text">Since there aren’t many of these programs and they have limited in space, you should contact the program and/or talk to your correctional counselor as soon as possible about contacting the housing program, finding out if you meet the eligibility requirements to participate, and how to get added to the waitlist if there is one.</p>
          <p class="text">Below are a few programs in different areas of California for reentering women and children. Please Note: This is not a complete list.</p>
          <ol class="text">Centerforce MOMS Program at Santa Rita Jail (in Alameda County, CA):</ol>
          <p class="address"><a href="http://www.centerforce.org/programs/moms-maximizing-opportunities-for-mothers-to-succeed/">http://www.centerforce.org/programs/moms-maximizing-opportunities-for-mothers-to-succeed/</a>PO Box 415San Quentin, CA 94964(415) 456-9980</p>

          <p class="address"><a href="http://www.cjcj.org/Direct-services/Cameo-House.html">http://www.cjcj.org/Direct-services/Cameo-House.html</a>424 Guerro St.San Francisco, CA 94110(415) 703-0600</p>
          <p class="text">CAMEO House provides transitional housing in San Francisco for formerly incarcerated mothers with children.<em> </em></p>
          <p class="text">In addition to housing, the program provides supportive services to address a range of issues, including substance abuse, unemployment, mental health as well as help with family reunification. CJCJ’s staff helps residents obtain stable housing and gainful employment within six months of their placement, although residents may remain for up to two years. </p>

          <ol class="text">Providence Place (San Diego, CA):</ol>
          <p class="address"><a href="http://www.mhsinc.org/files/file/Program%20Brochures/Providence%20Place%20Brochure_2012_web.pdf">http://www.mhsinc.org/files/file/Program%20Brochures/<br/>Providence%20Place%20Brochure_2012_web.pdf</a>4890 67th St.,San Diego, CA 92115(619) 667-5287</p>
          <p class="text">Providence Place is a residential substance abuse treatment program that serves women on parole or community supervision and their dependent children. </p>
          <p class="text">In addition to housing, Providence Place provides substance abuse treatment; comprehensive case management and family reunification services; a parenting center focused on child development, parenting skills and family therapy; specialized support groups to address grief and loss, self esteem, trauma, and other needs; and employment development services. The program is available to women on active parole/post release community supervision and their minor children (typically up to the age of 12).

          <ol class="text">Free At Last (East Palo Alto, CA): </ol>
          <p class="address"><a href="http://www.freeatlast.org/services.html">http://www.freeatlast.org/services.html</a>1796 Bay RoadEast Palo Alto, CA 94303(650) 462-6999</p>
          <p class="answer">Free At Last offers several housing options for women with children, including:</p>
          <ol class="text">The <em>Residential Treatment Program for Women and Women with Children</em> provides 7–9 months of residential treatment for women and women with children.

          <ol class="text">The <em>Transitional Clean and Sober Living</em> program provides shared supportive housing for men, women, and women with children.</ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: starting in a shelter before moving into other housing</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">Starting off in an emergency shelter may help you to find transitional or permanent housing and/or access other services afterward. Although many transitional housing programs and social service providers will run background checks and have record-related restrictions, if you are living at a domestic violence shelter, the staff may be able to write a letter or provide a referral to a transitional housing program, which can help explain your situation and get around their restrictions.</p>
