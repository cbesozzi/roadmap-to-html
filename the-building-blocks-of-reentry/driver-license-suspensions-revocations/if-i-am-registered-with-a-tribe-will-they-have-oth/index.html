  <h3><a id="_Toc328831299"></a>If I am registered with a tribe, will they have other identification documents on file for me or my family members?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">It depends on the tribe and whether you are enrolled. If you are already enrolled with a tribe and trying to recover old identification (ID) documents, you can contact your tribe directly and ask if they have any of those documents on file. There is no guarantee, but it’s worth checking!</p>

  <h3><a id="_Toc328831302"></a>Why would I get a library card?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-242" id="footnote-ref-242">[242]</a></sup></strong></h3>
  
  <p class="text">Although anyone can visit a public library and use certain resources there, <em>you need a library card to borrow books and other materials</em> (to use them outside of the building). Also, in some libraries, you may need to get a library card before you can use the Internet or computers.</p>
