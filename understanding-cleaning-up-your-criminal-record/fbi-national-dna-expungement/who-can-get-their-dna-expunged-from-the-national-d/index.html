  <p>
    Who can get their DNA expunged from the national database?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your DNA sample was taken for a federal arrest or conviction, you may qualify to have your DNA expunged from the FBI’s national database if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your federal arrest did NOT result in a conviction, because NO charges were filed against you, or the charges were dismissed, or you were acquitted;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The national DNA database is also called “CODIS,” which stands for Combined DNA Index System
  </p>
  
  <p>
    OR
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your federal conviction has been overturned.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to get your DNA expunged, you will need to provide an official court order showing the final outcome of your arrest, case, or overturned conviction.[3185] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For details on how to get your DNA expunged from the federal database, see APPENDIX Z, on PG. 1263.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    NOTE: If you want to get your California DNA sample expunged from the national database, you will need to contact the California DOJ and follow the instructions in APPENDIX Z, on PG. 1263 for expungement from the California DNA database.[3186]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For more information on expungement of DNA from the national database, visit the FBI’s website on CODIS—Expungement Policy, available at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/codis_expungement.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Conclusion
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hopefully this Chapter has given you a better understanding of your criminal records, how to correct errors early in your reentry.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Later in reentry, if you become eligible, we hope this Chapter has also shown you the many options that are available to help you “clean up” your record and minimize its impact on your life.
