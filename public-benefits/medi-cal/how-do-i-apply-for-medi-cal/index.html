  <p>
    How do I apply for Medi-Cal?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can apply for Medi-Cal by submitting a Covered California application through several methods: online, by phone, in person, by mail, or by fax.[1457] You can get the paper application at your local county social services office, or online at https://www.coveredca.com/PDFs/paper_application/CA-SingleStreamApp_92MAX.pdf. The introductory pages of the application (but not the full application) can be found here in Appendix D, PG. 640.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Online: Go to www.CoveredCA.com. Set up an account with a username and password. Once you log in, you can apply for Medi-Cal.[1458] Or you may use BenefitsCal by visiting http://www.benefitscal.org, where you can apply for several California benefits programs in addition to Medi-Cal all at once. We suggest contacting your county Medi-Cal office prior to applying online, because some counties prefer that you apply in person.

    By phone: Call your county social services office to apply by phone. You can contact Covered California to ask for the number of your county social services office by calling Covered California at 1-800-300-1506 (TTY: 1-888-889-4500), or by visiting its website: http://www.coveredca.com/contact/.

  <p>
    In person: Visit your county social services office. (For a statewide directory, see Appendix A, PG. 634,.)[1459] At the office, you can pick up the application form, get help filling it out, and submit it.
