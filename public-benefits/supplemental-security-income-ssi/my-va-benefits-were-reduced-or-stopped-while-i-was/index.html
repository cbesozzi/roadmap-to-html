          <h4>For disability compensation or pension benefits:</h4>
          <ol class="text">The VA will not automatically resume paying benefits at the full amount once you are released. Once you have a release date, contact the VA as early as 30 days before that date. Provide official proof of your release date, such as VA Form 21-4193 (see Appendix J, PG. 677) or your parole papers.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1729" id="footnote-ref-1729">[1699]</a></sup></sup> As long as you notify the VA within one year following your release, you’ll receive benefits dating back to your release date.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1730" id="footnote-ref-1730">[1700]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">The VA will backdate your benefits to the date of release if you provide the VA with proof of your release within one year of your release. If you do not provide notification of your release within one year, your benefits will only be retroactive to the date of the notification.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1731" id="footnote-ref-1731">[1701]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You can use VA Form 21-4193 to notify the VA of your incarceration and/or release. (See Appendix J, PG. 677.) If you’re incarcerated, you can get this form from a correctional counselor. If you have Internet access, download the form at <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?documentID=203887&amp;version=1">www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?documentID=203887&amp;version=1</a>. You can also call 1-800-827-1000 and ask that the form be mailed to you. The form must be signed by a correctional official to be valid as proof.</ol>
          <h4>For health care benefits: </h4>
          <ol class="text">If you don’t have your Veteran Identification Card, and/or if you plan to access services at a VA health care facility you haven’t visited before, complete VA Form 10-10EZ (see Appendix I, PG. 672) and send it to that facility. Doing this at least 6 months before your release can help ensure you’ll have access to health care when you get out.<sup><a href="#footnote-1732" id="footnote-ref-1732">[1702]</a></sup> You can request this form by calling or writing to any VA health care facility, or by calling 1-877-222-8387.<sup><a href="#footnote-1733" id="footnote-ref-1733">[1703]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If you have your Veteran Identification Card, and if you plan to access services at a VA health care facility you’ve visited before, you should be able to access services there without submitting any forms.<sup><a href="#footnote-1734" id="footnote-ref-1734">[1704]</a></sup> </ol>
          <h4>Debts owed to the VA caused by incarceration: </h4>
          <ol class="text">If you were paid VA benefits after your 61<sup>st</sup> day of incarceration you may have an overpayment. An overpayment may prevent you from receiving the full benefit amount to which you are entitled after you are released. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Whenever an overpayment is established in any program under the jurisdiction of the Veterans Benefits Administration, the Debt Management Center (DMC) at the St. Paul, Minnesota, VA Regional Office assumes responsibility over your debt. The VA DMC may be contacted by mail<sup><a href="#footnote-1735" id="footnote-ref-1735">[1705]</a></sup> or by calling 1-800-827-0648.<sup><a href="#footnote-1736" id="footnote-ref-1736">[1706]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">You may request a waiver of your debt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1737" id="footnote-ref-1737">[1707]</a></sup> The VA does not require the use of a specific form to request a waiver.<sup><a href="#footnote-1738" id="footnote-ref-1738">[1708]</a></sup> The time limit for requesting waiver of an overpayment is 180 days from the date you are first advised of the existence of the overpayment and the notification specifies the amount of the debt. A request for waiver should be submitted to the DMC with a completed financial status report using VA Form 20-5655.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If the VA incorrectly calculated your dates of incarceration, you may challenge the validity of the debt or the effective date of the debt.<sup><a href="#footnote-1739" id="footnote-ref-1739">[1709]</a></sup> There is no official form for disputing the validity of the debt. </ol>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153371"></a>I’m disqualified from VA benefits because of my negative discharge status. How can I have my discharge status reviewed for an upgrade? </h3>
          <p class="text">These requests are rarely granted, so you may want to get help.</p>
          <p class="text">If you left the military <em>less than 15 years ago</em>, apply for a “Review of Discharge or Dismissal” using Department of Defense’s DD Form 293 (see copy of form in Appendix K, PG. 679.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1740" id="footnote-ref-1740">[1710]</a></sup></sup> You can also have the form mailed to you by calling the VA at 1-703-607-1600; or by sending a written request to: Army Review Boards Agency; ATTN: Client Information and Quality Assurance; Arlington, VA 22202-4508. Alternatively, obtain DD Form 293 from a VA regional office, or online at <a href="http://www.usapa.army.mil">http://www.usapa.army.mil</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1741" id="footnote-ref-1741">[1711]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">The Review Board will grant your uPGrade request only if your discharge reason was “inequitable” (not consistent with the policies and traditions of the service) or “improper” (based on error, or violating a law or regulation). With your application form, include written statements and records that help prove this.<sup><a href="#footnote-1742" id="footnote-ref-1742">[1712]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">If you left the military <em>more than 15 years ago</em>, apply for a Correction of Military Records using DD Form 149 (see copy of form in Appendix L, PG. 684).<sup><a href="#footnote-1743" id="footnote-ref-1743">[1713]</a></sup>You can also have the form mailed to you by calling the VA at 1-703-607-1600; or by sending a written request to: Army Review Boards Agency; ATTN: Client Information and Quality Assurance; Arlington, VA 22202-4508. Alternatively, obtain DD Form 149 from a VA regional office, or online at <a href="http://www.usapa.army.mil">www.usapa.army.mil</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1744" id="footnote-ref-1744">[1714]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">Generally, you must request a correction within 3 years of discovering an “error” or “injustice” in your record. However, if the Board for Correction finds it is “in the interest of justice” to excuse a late request, it may do so. If your request is late, you must explain why your application was delayed, and why it’s in the interest of justice for the Board to consider it despite the delay. </ol>
          <h4 class="sidebox">INTEREST OF JUSTICE?</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">In the majority cases, former service members are simply unaware of the 3-year filing deadline. If this is true in your case, say so! If not, briefly explain why you are filing late, and why it would unfair for the Board of Corrections to not consider your application.</p>
          <ol class="text">The Board for Correction will grant your request if you show that something in the record is inaccurate or unjust. With your application form, include ALL available evidence that helps to prove this, such as signed witness statements, personnel records, or a brief of arguments supporting the correction.<sup><a href="#footnote-1745" id="footnote-ref-1745">[1715]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text">Because these applications are rarely granted, you should consider the following options to get help: </p>
          <ol class="text">Contact a local veteran service organization to see if any staff can help you complete the forms and/or represent you. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Find a legal aid lawyer who specializes in discharge reviews.</ol>
          <ol class="text">Using the contact information provided on the form (see DD 293 or DD 149, whichever applied to you), contact the Review Board to discuss your case and ask questions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1746" id="footnote-ref-1746">[1716]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have an undesirable, other than honorable (OTH), or a bad conduct discharge, you may be eligible for VA benefits if the VA determines that your service was “other than dishonorable” through the <em>Character of Discharge</em> administrative process.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1747" id="footnote-ref-1747">[1717]</a></sup></strong></p>
          <ul class="importantbox">You may apply for a Character of Discharge determination by applying for any VA benefit. The VA will only consider your time in service in making the determination.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1748" id="footnote-ref-1748">[1718]</a></sup></strong>You will not be eligible for a favorable determination if you are statutorily barred from benefits.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1749" id="footnote-ref-1749">[1719]</a></sup></strong>The VA may consider any number of factors in deciding whether to grant a favorable decision, including, your length of service, whether you deployed to a combat zone, whether you were diagnosed with a medical condition prior to or shortly after discharge, and any other relevant factors.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1750" id="footnote-ref-1750">[1720]</a></sup></strong></ul>
