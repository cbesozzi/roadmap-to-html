  <p>
    How can I find out the criminal record policies of my local Public Housing Authority (PHA) or of the owner of government-assisted housing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    REMEMBER THAT THESE “CATCH-ALL” BANS ARE NOT REQUIRED: This “catch-all” category is NOT a required ban. The PHA or owner is allowed to exclude you only if they can show that your criminal history poses a current threat to the health, safety, or peace of other residents, the owner, or PHA staff or agents/contractors. It’s recommended that they consider mitigating information and proof of your rehabilitation—and in the case of the Public Housing program, the PHA MUST consider such additional information!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing will have different rules about what criminal history information they will ignore and what they will consider. By law, the PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST put their policies in writing and make them available to applicants.[1136] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The rules and policies of each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing MUST not violate the legal protections discussed on PG. 428. Furthermore, the PHA must follow its own rules and policies. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may want to consider talking to an advocate/lawyer about whether or not a particular PHA’s policies to exclude people with certain criminal records could be violating the law. (See PG. 1286 for a list of legal aid providers across California).
  </p>
  
  <p>
     IMPORTANT: Want to learn how to challenge a denial from a PHA or owner of government-assisted housing? Go to PG. 408 to learn more!
