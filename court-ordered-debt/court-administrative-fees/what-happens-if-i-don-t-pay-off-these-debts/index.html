          <h1>What happens if I don't pay off these debts?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153515"></a>What happens if I don't pay off these debts?</h3>
          <p class="text">It depends. Different types of debts have different consequences if you don’t pay them off. The consequences are also affected by the amount of debt you owe, how old the debt is, and which agency is trying to collect from you (for example, whether your debt is still with the court, with county collections, with a private collection agency, or with the Franchise Tax Board). </p>
          <p class="text">In the previous section we explained what can happen if you don’t pay debts that are conditions of your supervision. This section will explain some of the <em>other</em> consequences you may face if you don’t pay off your court-ordered debts (whether you are on supervision or not).</p>
          <h4><a id="COD_DebtCollection_ifnopayment"></a>Debt Collection:</h4>
          <p class="text">If you owe unpaid restitution, fines, or court fees, the people or agencies that you owe (i.e. the victim, the victim’s family, the Victim Compensation Board, the Franchise Tax Board, private collection agencies) can try to collect the unpaid debt in the following ways:<sup><a href="#footnote-2109" id="footnote-ref-2109">[2078]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text"><a id="COD_WageGarnishment"></a><em>Wage garnishment—</em>If you are employed, a portion of your wages (up to 25%) can be automatically taken out (withheld) from your paycheck to pay your court-ordered debt. Money can continue to be taken from your paycheck until you have paid off the full amount you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2110" id="footnote-ref-2110">[2079]</a></sup> (For more information about what to do if your wages are being garnished by the Franchise Tax Board, see PG. 840.)</ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>Property lien—</em>If you own property (like a car or a house) a <em>lien</em> can be put on your property. A lien gives the person (or agency) that you owe the right to <em>claim your property</em> to satisfy the debt you owe them. If you have a lien on your property, you may not be able to sell that property until you have paid off the amount you owe. If you DO sell the property, you will have to give over the money from the sale to the person you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2111" id="footnote-ref-2111">[2080]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>Lien on your bank account—</em>If you have a bank account, a lien can be put on the account. You will not be able to access the money in your account, and any checks you write from the account will bounce until the lien is removed.<sup><a href="#footnote-2112" id="footnote-ref-2112">[2081]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">All of these actions can lower your<em> credit score</em>, which can make it harder to get a loan, rent an apartment, or find a job. </p>
          <h4>Other possible consequences:</h4>
          <p class="text">There are other possible consequences of unpaid or overdue debt, but everyone’s situation will be different. Some other ways that you may be negatively impacted by unpaid court-ordered debt are:</p>
          <ol class="text">Your <em>driver license</em> can be suspended due to unpaid court debts AND you can be charged extra fees.<sup><a href="#footnote-2113" id="footnote-ref-2113">[2082]</a></sup> (Your driver license can also be suspended for other types of unpaid debt, such as child support or unpaid loans. See PG. 62 of the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER for more information about driver license suspensions.)</ol>
          <ol class="text">It can be harder to get a <em>professional or occupational license</em>, which is required for many types of jobs. For example, you need an occupational license to work as a barber, beautician, nurse, or contractor. (For more information on professional/occupational licenses, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, PG. 748.)</ol>
          <ol class="text">The Franchise Tax Board can seize any <em>state tax refunds,</em> <em>lottery winnings, or other income</em> to pay off your restitution and fine obligations.<sup><a href="#footnote-2114" id="footnote-ref-2114">[2083]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you are <em>ordered to appear</em> in court because you have not paid your court-ordered debt, and you do not go to court, you could be <em>arrested</em> and charged with a <em>misdemeanor</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2115" id="footnote-ref-2115">[2084]</a></sup> </ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>Important</em>: If you have not made payments, you won’t be arrested simply for not paying. However, if a judge has ordered you to come to court and explain why you are not paying, you can be arrested for not going to court. </ol>
          <ol class="text">If you receive an “order to appear,” you MUST go to court on the day and time listed in the order. Even if you don’t have any money to make the payments, it is very important that you attend this court hearing. </ol>
          <ol class="text">Unpaid restitution and/or other fines can make it harder, to get your conviction dismissed under California’s “expungement” statute.<sup><a href="#footnote-2116" id="footnote-ref-2116">[2085]</a></sup> But, you cannot be denied a mandatory dismissal of your conviction just because you have unpaid victim restitution. (For more information, see PG 1168 in the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS CHAPTER, beginning on PG 1132).</ol>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintWhat is a “credit score,” and why does it matter?</h4>
          <div class="widetextboxtext">A credit score is a record of how you have borrowed and repaid money in the past, and is considered a predictor of whether you are likely to repay your debts in the future. Your credit score is a number—usually between 300 and 850. <em>The higher the number, the better your score.</em> Your credit score is based on things like current debts you owe (including court-ordered debts), whether you've paid off previous debts in a timely manner, your income, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-2117" id="footnote-ref-2117">[2086]</a></sup> Creditors, landlords, and some employers may look at your credit score when deciding whether to give you a loan, rent an apartment to you, or hire you for a job. (<em>Note</em>: In California, only certain people can legally see your credit score. For more information about what employers and landlords can see about you, see the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER (PG. 687) and HOUSING CHAPTER (PG. 368).If you want to know what your credit score is, you will probably have to pay to get it from a commercial credit reporting agency. However, you are entitled to a FREE COPY of your credit report, which will let you see the information that is used to calculate your credit score. You can request your free credit report by mail by submitting an Annual Credit Report Request Form.<sup><a href="#footnote-2118" id="footnote-ref-2118">[2087]</a></sup> A sample form is included in Appendix A, PG. 852. For more information about getting your credit report, contact the Annual Credit Report Request Service at 1-877-322-8228. </div>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153516"></a></h3>
          <h3>Does a credit report show restitution and court fines?</h3>
          <p class="text">Criminal record information doesn’t usually show up on your credit report. If you have been making your payments regularly and on time, restitution and other court-ordered debt shouldn’t show up on your credit report at all.<sup><a href="#footnote-2119" id="footnote-ref-2119">[2088]</a></sup> However, once you begin missing payments, the court can sell your debt to a collection agency that will likely report the debt to the credit bureau.<sup><a href="#footnote-2120" id="footnote-ref-2120">[2089]</a></sup> </p>
          <p class="text">Additionally, if you don’t pay off your debt, a creditor or debt collector can sue you to collect. If they win, the court will attempt to enforce the debt as a civil judgment against you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2121" id="footnote-ref-2121">[2090]</a></sup> Unlike criminal judgments, civil judgments (such as child support payments and money owed after losing a lawsuit) do show up on credit reports. Civil judgments are categorized in the public records section of a credit report, and are generally listed as “judgments.”<sup><a href="#footnote-2122" id="footnote-ref-2122">[2091]</a></sup> Thus, it is unlikely that anyone (such as a landlord) could use your credit report to see information about your criminal conviction. Still, it’s a good idea to get a copy of your credit report to make sure. For more information about how to get your credit report, see page 731. For information on how to get and keep a good credit score, see Appendix I on page 781. </p>
          <h3>What are my options if my wages are garnished or there is a lien on my property?</h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL TIP: </h4>
          <p class="sidebox">For more information on your credit report and your credit score, see Appendix I, PG. 878, or contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at (855) 411-2372, or online at: <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/search/?selected_facets=category_exact:credit-reporting">http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/search/?selected_facets=category_exact:credit-reporting</a>.</p>
          <p class="text">If your wages are being garnished or there is a lien on your bank account or property, you may be able to request an <em>exemption</em> for money or property that you need to live on (such as your car or house). An exemption means that the portion of your wages or property that you need in order to support yourself and your family CANNOT be taken.<sup><a href="#footnote-2123" id="footnote-ref-2123">[2092]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text"><em>For more information about requesting an exemption from wage garnishment</em>, talk to your employer. You should have received a notice regarding your wage garnishment (called an “Earnings Withholding Order,” form WG-002) and instructions on how to request an exemption (Judicial Council form WG-003).<sup><a href="#footnote-2124" id="footnote-ref-2124">[2093]</a></sup> These forms are available in Appendix B, PG. 854, and Appendix C, PG. 858. They are also available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg002.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg002.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg003.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg003.pdf</a>.</ol>
          <ol class="text"><em>To request an exemption from a property lien</em>, you will need to file a <em>Claim of Exemption (Judicial Council form EJ-160)</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2125" id="footnote-ref-2125">[2094]</a></sup> This form is provided in Appendix D, PG. 861 and is also available online at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf</a>. For a list of the types of property that you can request an exemption for see Appendix E, PG. 863 (Judicial Council form EJ-155), or go to <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf">http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf</a>.</ol>
          <ol class="text">If your wages are being garnished by the CA Franchise Tax Board (FTB), you can claim a financial hardship and ask them to reduce the amount taken out of each paycheck.<sup><a href="#footnote-2126" id="footnote-ref-2126">[2095]</a></sup> Call the FTB at (916) 845-4064 to ask for assistance. (<em>Note</em>: The Franchise Tax Board CANNOT change the total amount of debt you owe, only the amount being taken from each paycheck.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2127" id="footnote-ref-2127">[2096]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text">Even if you don’t have enough money to pay off your debts, it’s important to show that you are making an effort and want to pay them off! The court and judge will often work with you if you can <em>show that you are trying to take responsibility for your debt to the best of your ability</em>. You can ask the judge to help you set up an <em>installment plan</em>, or request that he or she <em>waive</em> (forgive) some of fines and fees. Many courts will let you do <em>community service</em> to work off your debt—or you can even opt to spend time in <em>jail</em> to pay off or reduce what you owe.<sup><a href="#footnote-2128" id="footnote-ref-2128">[2097]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">If your debt has been sent to a private collection agency or the FTB, you can ask that agency to help you set up a <em>payment plan</em>. If the FTB is garnishing your wages, you can also ask them to change the amount that is being taken out of your paycheck (but they CANNOT change the total amount of debt you owe.) The FTB can be very helpful—so don’t be afraid to contact them for assistance! </p>
          <p class="text">The bottom line: Court-ordered debt can be a scary thing to deal with. But even if you can’t pay now, there are other things you can do to improve your situation. DON’T IGNORE YOUR DEBT or it will only get worse!</p>
