  <h1>What can’t employers ask about my criminal record?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153410"></a>What can’t employers ask about my criminal record?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">There are certain parts of your criminal record that employers CANNOT legally ask you about. Under state law, an employer cannot ask you about:</p>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTPublic vs. Private Employers</h4>
  
  <p class="textbox">Public (government) employers can ask and get access to more information than private companies or nonprofit organizations. Read carefully to understand what laws apply to public vs. private employers.</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Convictions that have been sealed, dismissed, expunged, or statutorily eradicated.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-1780" id="footnote-ref-1780">[1750]</a></sup> A private employer cannot ask a question like, “Have you ever been convicted of any crimes that were dismissed?” And if a private employer asks about these convictions, you don’t have to report ones that were expunged/dismissed.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">EXCEPTION: On the other hand, public (government) employers and law enforcement agencies can request more information about dismissed records from you than private employers.<sup><a href="#footnote-1781" id="footnote-ref-1781">[1751]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Convictions for minor marijuana-related offenses, if the conviction is over 2 years old.</em><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1782" id="footnote-ref-1782">[1752]</a></sup></sup> Minor marijuana-related convictions over 2 years old that an employer CANNOT ask about include, but are not limited to:</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Marijuana possession (other than concentrated cannabis).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1783" id="footnote-ref-1783">[1753]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Carrying or giving away small amounts of marijuana (other than concentrated cannabis).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1784" id="footnote-ref-1784">[1754]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Having a pipe, bong, or other device for illegally smoking marijuana.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1785" id="footnote-ref-1785">[1755]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Being in a room, car, or other location with someone who is illegally using or smoking marijuana, and helping them to do it.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1786" id="footnote-ref-1786">[1756]</a></sup></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Unlawfully being under the influence of marijuana (in other words, being <em>high</em>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1787" id="footnote-ref-1787">[1757]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Arrests that did not lead to a conviction.</em> Employers (private and most public employers) CANNOT ask about past arrests where you were not convicted of the alleged crime. This includes arrests where the charges against you were never brought, charges were dismissed, and cases where you were found not guilty. THERE ARE 3 EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE YOU SHOULD KNOW:<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1788" id="footnote-ref-1788">[1758]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">First, private and public employers can still ask about recent arrests that are pending or unresolved (for example, if you were arrested, posted bail money, and are awaiting trial, the arrest is still considered pending, and employers can learn out about those). PLEASE NOTE: If you live in a city or county that has “banned the box,” the rule for when employers can ask about pending arrests is different. See PG. 708 for more information about when an employer can ask.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Second, law enforcement employers can ask about and consider all arrests.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Third, health care facilities and pharmacy employers can ask about and consider CERTAIN arrests (for drug and/or sexual offenses) if you are applying for a job with regular access to drugs or medications (for drug arrests), or to patients (for sexual offense arrests).</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Arrests that led to the completion of a court diversion program.</em> A court diversion program (such as a drug rehabilitation program) helps a person charged with certain crimes avoid criminal charges—and therefore avoid a criminal record. By law, employers are NOT allowed to ask for any information about your participation in a court diversion program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1789" id="footnote-ref-1789">[1759]</a></sup> </ol>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Convictions More Than 7 Years Old</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">There is a weird gap in the law that you should know about. While employers CAN ask about and consider convictions older than 7 years old (and can ask you about these as part of an in-house background check), private background check companies CANNOT report information about convictions more than 7 years old on your background check report. This CANNOT come up in a background check.<strong> </strong></p>
  
  <p class="importantbox">REMEMBER: In general, if an employer asks you if you were ever arrested, you SHOULD NOT answer that question, and you DO NOT have to. Politely remind the employer that if he/she wants to learn about your criminal record, he/she can ask ONLY about relevant convictions—NOT arrests—to protect your rights.<strong> </strong></p>
