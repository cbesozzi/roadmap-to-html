  <p>
    Who can get their juvenile records sealed?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Like everything else, it depends. You must meet 5 basic criteria in order to get your juvenile record sealed:[3139]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are over 18 years old, OR it has been 5 years since you were last arrested or completed your juvenile probation (whichever is later);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You do NOT have any convictions as an adult for a felony OR for a misdemeanor involving “moral turpitude.” (“Moral turpitude” means the offense involved dishonest or immoral behavior,[3140] such as theft, fraud, certain sex and drug offenses, and offenses causing significant bodily injury); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your case started and ended in juvenile court (not in some other court, such as probate court or adult criminal court);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can demonstrate (and convince the judge) that you have been rehabilitated; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There is NO open civil lawsuit based on your juvenile offense.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you don’t meet ALL of the above requirements, you cannot get your juvenile record sealed.
