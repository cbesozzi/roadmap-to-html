          <h1>Will my criminal history affect my ability to get federal student aid?</h1>
          <h3><a id="EDU_FederalAid_CriminalRecordAffect"></a><a id="ED_FederalAid_CriminalRecordAffect"></a><a id="_Toc448153838"></a>Will my criminal history affect my ability to get federal student aid?</h3>
          <p class="text">Maybe. It depends on the circumstances of your offense, the type of aid you are applying for, and your incarceration status.<sup><a href="#footnote-2845" id="footnote-ref-2845">[2812]</a></sup> The following is a summary of the possible implications of a criminal record on your federal student aid eligibility.</p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">Drug Convictions: </div>
          <p class="text">If you were convicted of possession or sale of a controlled substance (felony or misdemeanor) while you were already receiving federal student aid, you will be ineligible to receive federal student aid funds for a specified period of time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2846" id="footnote-ref-2846">[2813]</a></sup> The length of time you are ineligible depends on the type and number these convictions you have, and whether or not you have fulfilled any rehabilitation requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-2847" id="footnote-ref-2847">[2814]</a></sup> (For detailed information on federal student aid and drug convictions, see Appendix E, PG. 1106.)</p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">Sex Offense Convictions: </div>
          <p class="text">If you have been convicted of a forcible or non-forcible sex offense and you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment after your incarceration for that offense, you are ineligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.<sup><a href="#footnote-2848" id="footnote-ref-2848">[2815]</a></sup> However, you are still eligible for other types of federal student aid. </p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">Currently Incarcerated:</div>
          <p class="text">Unfortunately, while you are incarcerated, you are directly prohibited from getting certain kinds of federal aid (by law), and indirectly banned from some of the others (by logistics). However, once you are released, most of these restrictions are lifted and you become eligible to receive all forms of federal aid. You can even apply before your release so that your aid will be ready by the time you start school.<sup><a href="#footnote-2849" id="footnote-ref-2849">[2816]</a></sup></p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">Selective Service:</div>
          <p class="text">You are not eligible for federal or state financial aid if you did not register for the Selective Service, unless you fall into one of the exceptions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2850" id="footnote-ref-2850">[2817]</a></sup> See Pg. 90 to figure out whether you are (or were) required to register; how to register now (if you are between 18 and 25 years old and required to register); and how to request an excuse (in a “Status Information Letter”) for not having registered before (if you are 26 or older, never registered, and do not fall into one of the exceptions). </p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you’re incarcerated, do not fill out the FAFSA unless you know you are going to be released in time to attend school <em>that same year</em>. FAFSA information is only good for one year. (Everyone who applies for federal student aid must complete a new FAFSA every year.) </p>
          <div class="headingboldunderl11">On Parole or Probation </div>
          <p class="text">You are free to apply for all forms of federal student aid, including those you couldn’t get while you were incarcerated. However, the drug and sex offense restrictions still apply (see above).<sup><a href="#footnote-2851" id="footnote-ref-2851">[2818]</a></sup></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153839"></a>Can I get federal student aid while I’m incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">It depends on what institution you are in, and what it offers,<sup><a href="#footnote-2852" id="footnote-ref-2852">[2819]</a></sup> so keep reading this section to better understand your eligibility for federal grants and federal loans. Most of the educational programs available to you while you are incarcerated are either free or do not qualify for financial aid in the first place. But remember, while you cannot <em>receive</em> most financial aid while you are incarcerated, you can still <em>apply</em> for financial aid so that the money is waiting for you when you get out.<sup><a href="#footnote-2853" id="footnote-ref-2853">[2820]</a></sup></p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc448153840"></a>Am I eligible for federal <em>grants</em> while I’m incarcerated? </h3>
          <p class="text">Maybe, It depends on <em>where</em> you are confined.<sup><a href="#footnote-2854" id="footnote-ref-2854">[2821]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">THIS IS A NEW LEGAL UPDATE!</span> In 2015, the U.S. Department of Education (U.S. DOE) launched a new federal program called the “<em>Second Chance Pell Pilot Program,”</em> which allows some incarcerated people to receive federal Pell Grants to cover many of the costs of college (tuition, fees, books, and supplies) while incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2855" id="footnote-ref-2855">[2822]</a></sup> Before this announcement, currently incarcerated people in state and federal facilities were NOT able to receive Federal Pell Grants.</p>
          <p class="text">The “Second Chance Pilot Pell Program” focuses on those who are eligible for release, especially students who are likely to be released within five years of getting their college education. The program is available only at certain state and federal correctional facilities that have applied to participate. More than 100 correctional facilities across the country are currently participating in the program, in partnership with 67 colleges and universities.<sup><a href="#footnote-2856" id="footnote-ref-2856">[2823]</a></sup> As of the publishing of this guide, the following California institutions are participating: California State Prison, Los Angeles County; California Institution for Women; Sierra Conservation Camp; and Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility.<sup><a href="#footnote-2857" id="footnote-ref-2857">[2824]</a></sup></p>
          <ol class="text">BUT NOTE: If you are committed to a juvenile detention facility, and you otherwise meet the requirements, you ARE eligible for a federal Pell Grant. </ol>
          <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to be eligible for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) you must have already received a Pell Grant. Therefore, if your institution does not offer one of the “Second Chance Pilot Pell Grants” because you are incarcerated, then by default, you are also not eligible for a FSEOG. </p>
