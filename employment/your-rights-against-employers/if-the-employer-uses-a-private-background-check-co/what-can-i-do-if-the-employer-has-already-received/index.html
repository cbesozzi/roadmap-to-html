          <h3><a id="_Toc448153424"></a>What can I do if the employer has already received information from a background check report that it shouldn’t have received by law?</h3>
          <p class="text">Unfortunately, employers sometimes get information that should NOT have been included in your background check report. They might ask you about it during an interview (or on a job application), or consider the information when deciding whether to hire you. Here are some suggested steps if this happens to you:</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>STEP 1: </strong>The first recommended step is that you get a copy of the background check report, so that you know what information the employer is seeing. For this reason, it’s important to always check the box to request a copy of the report when you give permission to an employer to run a background check on you.</p>
          <p class="text">If you didn’t check the box before, you can still get a copy of the report in 2 ways:</p>
          <ol class="text">If the employer decides take an adverse (negative) action against you—such as rejecting your job application—they must give you a copy of the background check report before taking the action.<sup><a href="#footnote-1832" id="footnote-ref-1832">[1802]</a></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">The background check company is required to give you a copy of the same report sent to the employer, if you ask for it within (at least) 2 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-1833" id="footnote-ref-1833">[1803]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text"><strong>STEP 2: </strong>If there are errors or inaccurate information on the background check report, it’s recommended that you point this out to the employer right away. If possible, you may also want to show the employer any proof of the correct information—for example, court papers showing that your conviction has been expunged, or that charges against you were dismissed. </p>
          <p class="text">You also have the right to make the background check company correct the information, and send the employer a notice and statement of the correction. For more information on correcting information with the background check company and notifying the employer of the correction, see PG. 724 below.</p>
          <p class="text"><strong>STEP 3:</strong> If the employer asks you about things that should NOT have been in your background check report—such as convictions that are more than 7 years old—it’s recommended you answer the question directly and honestly, but briefly:</p>
          <ol class="text">You can take responsibility for your actions. State the facts, but express regret for what happened. Don’t get defensive. Be honest, but don’t go into details. </ol>
          <ol class="text">You don’t need to go into details. Keep your answer short. Be honest, but only talk about necessary information based on the questions you are asked.</ol>
          <ol class="text">You can the employer how you have changed. Emphasize that the incident happened long ago and that you are a different person now. Explain what you learned while you were in prison/jail, and what you are doing differently now. Paint a picture of the person you are now. </ol>
          <ol class="text">You can emphasize your qualifications. Describe the things that will make you a good employee—such as previous work experience, job training programs, or classes that you’ve done—and any letters of recommendation that you have. Show the employer why you are qualified for the position and will be a benefit to the company.</ol>
          <ol class="text">You can describe your hopes and dreams. Show the employer than you are in control of your life and have short-term and long-term goals. Highlight any services that you’re getting to help you move on and achieve your goals. Emphasize that you would be very appreciative of the opportunity to work for them, and you will be the hardest worker they will ever have.<sup><a href="#footnote-1834" id="footnote-ref-1834">[1804]</a></sup> </ol>
          <p class="text"><strong>STEP 4: </strong>If the employer asks you (or makes comments) about incorrect or improper information in your background check report, you may want to write down anything the employer says and anything you say to the employer, so that you have a record to protect your rights later.</p>
          <h4 class="textbox">know your rightsSummary of your rights if an employer runs a background check through a private background check company:</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. You can ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report.</ul>

          <h4 class="subheading3">WHAT AN EMPLOYER CAN FIND OUT AND CONSIDER THROUGH THEIR OWN BACKGROUND CHECK INVESTIGATION…AND THE RULES THAT LIMIT THESE SEARCHES.</h4>
          <h4 class="textbox">know your rightsGeneral Overview of the Law &amp; your Rights</h4>
          <ul class="textbox">Instead of hiring a background check company, employers can also directly access your criminal record and other public records by conducting their own “in-house” background check on you.Employers are NOT required to get your permission before running an in-house background check.You have the RIGHT to receive a COPY of any public information an employer is viewing. It is recommended that you NEVER give up this right!Your RAP sheet is generally confidential and NOT accessible by employers.Your RAP sheet is not the only place to find your criminal records, because most criminal records are public records.If an employer decides not to hire you based on information in a public record (including criminal court records), the employer MUST give you a COPY of the public records.An employer is NOT required to give you copies of any NON-public information used (such as information from talking to people who know you).</ul>
          <p class="text">Most employers hire an outside private background check company to gather public record information on job applicants and produce a background check report (this method of running a background check is covered in the previous section, starting on PG. 694).</p>
          <p class="text">However, instead of hiring an outside background check company, an employer can conduct its own “in-house” (internal) background check on you. The employer can look at your public records directly, as well as interview your friends, family members, and former employers or co-workers. This “in-house” type of background check is a less common practice, but it is important for you to understand that if an employer chooses this route, there are different legal protections than when a private company runs the background check. </p>
