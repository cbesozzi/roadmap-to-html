          <h1>Detailed Questions & Answers About Criminal Record Bans in Government-Assisted Housing</h1>
          <h3 class="subheading2"><a id="Criminal_activity_govhousing_QnA"></a><a id="HS_Apply_BansGovt_QnAdetailed"></a><a id="_Toc448153145"></a>Detailed Questions &amp; Answers About Criminal Record Bans in Government-Assisted Housing</h3>
          <h4 class="textbox">WARNING: Read carefully</h4>
          <p class="textbox">In the chart above, we summarize 4 situations where a Public Housing Authority (PHA) and the owners of federal government-assisted housing MUST reject you under law based on particular types of convictions. PLEASE NOTE: </p>
          <ul class="textbox">These required (“mandatory”) bans apply only to SOME types of federal government-assisted housing, but not ALL types. There are government-assisted housing programs where these bans <em>do not apply</em>.Also, some of these required bans will last for the rest of your life, but others are only temporary bans.Refer back to PG. 402 for an overview of required vs. allowed bans.</ul>
          <p class="textbox">SO READ CAREFULLY!<strong> </strong>Don’t assume the ban applies to you. Try to match your exact situation and conviction/criminal record with this chart to see how your criminal record will impact your ability to get into federal government-assisted housing.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p class="text">Here we explain the information from the chart above in a question &amp; answer format in much more detail. You will learn about the specifics of each of these criminal record bans in government-assisted housing. Later we explain how to challenge denials due to your criminal record, beginning on PG. 444.</p>
          <h4 class="sidebox">DO YOU NEED LEGAL HELP? </h4>
          <p class="sidebox">If you have legal questions, we suggest calling a housing legal aid provider from the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1286, or contact Root &amp; Rebound at 510-279-4662 for further guidance or a referral.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153146"></a>What bans are <em>required</em> in government-assisted housing—for specific types of convictions and specific housing programs?</h3>
              <p class="text">Here we explain the four bans that are required (“mandatory”) for SOME types of federal government-assisted housing programs, but not ALL. There might be government-assisted programs where these bans DO NOT APPLY. <em>So please read carefully!</em> </p>
              <h4 class="subheading3">BAN 1: Methamphetamine production on federal government-assisted property  Lifetime ban from 3 federal government-assisted housing programs</h4>
              <p class="text">Under federal law, PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST PERMANENTLY DENY admission to an entire household to three of the federal government-assisted housing programs—<em>(1) Public Housing, (2) the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and (3) the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program</em>—if ANY MEMBER<em> </em>of the household has ever been convicted for the manufacture or production of methamphetamine ON THE PREMISES of any type of federal government-assisted housing.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1147" id="footnote-ref-1147">[1117]</a></sup></sup> Because this rule is so specific, the lifetime ban applies to only a <em>very small number of housing applicants.</em></p>
              <p class="text">Let’s break it down further. As you apply to a PHA for government-assisted housing, this lifetime ban only applies to you if someone in your household was:</p>
              <ol class="text">Convicted (meaning found guilty in a court of law), </ol>
              <ol class="text">Of the manufacture or production of Methamphetamine, AND</ol>
              <ol class="text">The criminal activity took place on the premises (on the property) of any type of federal government-assisted housing.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Lastly, if you are applying to a government-assisted housing program that isn’t one of the 3 programs that PHAs run (again, those are Public Housing, the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program), then this mandatory lifetime ban does NOT apply to you or your household.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1148" id="footnote-ref-1148">[1118]</a></sup></sup> Instead, you should look at the catch-all ban on PG. 401 that is allowed, but not required.</ol>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>I was denied by the PHA or the owner of government-assisted housing, but based on the information in this legal guide, I think it was a mistake or the required ban doesn’t apply to me. </strong><a id="Challenge_denial_gov_assist_housing"></a><strong>How do I challenge the denial? </strong>If another assisted housing program—not one of the three listed above—tries to impose a lifetime ban on you due to your conviction for the manufacture of production of methamphetamine on the premises of federal government-assisted property, you can challenge the lifetime ban and present mitigating information (meaning facts that are specific to your case and circumstances showing you should not be denied the housing—see PG. 400). </p>
              <ul class="textbox">Go to PG. 447 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for an informal review hearing.Go to PG. 417 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information you should include with your application, and as proof of mitigating circumstances &amp; rehabilitation with any challenges you bring.If there was a mistake in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention.</ul>
              <p class="textbox"><em>Mistakes could include:</em></p>
              <ul class="textbox">Errors in your criminal records (see UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132)Even though you were on the premises of the federal government-assisted housing, you did not actually manufacture the drugs, but you were automatically denied housing anyway; OREven though you were involved in the manufacturing of the methamphetamines, you were a victim of domestic violence that led to your involvement, and you shouldn’t be punished by the PHA. </ul>
              <h4 class="subheading3">BAN 2: Sex offense convictions requiring lifetime registration  Lifetime ban for almost all federal government-assisted housing programs</h4>
              <p class="text">Under federal law, PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST PERMANENTLY DENY admission to an entire household—to almost all federal government-assisted housing programs—if ANY MEMBER of the applicant household is required to be <em>lifetime registered</em> under any state’s sex offender registration program.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1149" id="footnote-ref-1149">[1119]</a></sup></sup> </p>
              <p class="text">THIS REQUIRED BAN DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU if you are required to register as a sex offender for a temporary or limited amount of time. Again, the ban only applies if you are required to register as a sex offender in any state for the <em>rest of your life. </em>Unfortunately, PHAs and owners of government-assisted property will often mistakenly apply the ban to anyone registered as a sex offender.</p>
              <p class="answer"><strong>EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING PROGRAMS (NO REQUIRED BAN)</strong>: The other exception is that owners of two government-assisted housing programs—Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties and Rural Development (RD) housing—are NOT REQUIRED to deny admission to a lifetime registered sex offender; they have discretion.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1150" id="footnote-ref-1150">[1120]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>I was denied by the PHA or the owner of government-assisted housing because I am a registered sex offender, but based on the information in this legal guide, I think it was a mistake or the required ban doesn’t apply to me. How do I challenge the denial?</strong>Some PHAs or owners misinterpret the rules that apply to sex offender registrants, and some apply their own criteria—which in the real world means that the PHA or owner will end up automatically banning a person who <em>shouldn’t be automatically banned</em> (an example of this would be if a PHA had a policy that permanently bans all people required to register on a state’s Sex Offender Registry list, even people who don’t have to register for their entire lifetime).<em> </em>If this is your situation, you can challenge the denial by asking the PHA for an informal review hearing (see PG. 447).Only if you meet the <em>legal definition</em> of a lifetime registered sex offender can you be permanently denied federal government-assisted housing without any other consideration of your individual circumstances. Thus, if you do not have a lifetime sex offender registration requirement, the PHA should analyze the <em>time, nature and circumstances</em> of the offense, as appropriate for any other criminal activity (see PG. 393).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1151" id="footnote-ref-1151">[1121]</a></sup></sup> As an applicant, you should also be allowed to show mitigating information and/or proof of your rehabilitation (see PG. 417 for explanations of what counts as mitigating information and proof of rehabilitation). For example, if you do not have to register as a sex offender for the rest of your lifetime, you should be able to establish that the criminal conduct was not violent, did not involve children, happened a long time ago, and that there have been no problems since the conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1152" id="footnote-ref-1152">[1122]</a></sup></sup></p>
              <ol class="text">Go to PG. 447 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for a review hearing.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Go to PG. 417 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information and proof of rehabilitation you should include with your application, and/or with any challenges you bring.</ol>
              <ol class="text">If there was a MISTAKE in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention. Mistakes could include errors in your criminal records (see the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132, which discusses how to fix errors in your record).</ol>
              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: There are other restrictions on where people who must register as sex offenders can live under California state law. It is VERY IMPORTANT to check your state and local laws regarding these requirements to know if they apply to you, and how it will affect where you can live. See PG. 393 of this HOUSING CHAPTER and PG. 182 of the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER to understand additional restrictions on where 290 registrants can live in California.</p>
              <h4 class="subheading3"><a id="HSG_Fed_Ban_Past_Drug_Activity"></a>BAN 3: Past Eviction for Drug-Related Activity on Federal Government-Assisted Property  Minimum 3-year Ban for Three Federal Government-Assisted Housing Programs</h4>
              <p class="text">Under federal law, PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST DENY admission to an entire household to three of the government-assisted housing programs—<em>(1) Public Housing, (2) the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and (3) the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program</em>—if ANY MEMBER<em> </em>of the household has ever been EVICTED from <em>any federal government-assisted housing program or property</em> because of drug-related criminal activity.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1153" id="footnote-ref-1153">[1123]</a></sup></sup> This ban must last for a minimum of 3 years, starting from the date of eviction, but PHAs and owners can choose to extend it.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1154" id="footnote-ref-1154">[1124]</a></sup></sup></p>
              <p class="text">PLEASE NOTE: This ban only applies to the three types of federal government-assisted housing mentioned above. It does NOT apply to the following types of government-assisted housing programs:</p>
              <ol class="text"><a id="HSG_NoBan_Past_Drugs_LIHTC_RD"></a>Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties and Rural Development (RD) housing;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1155" id="footnote-ref-1155">[1125]</a></sup></sup></ol>
              <ol class="text"><a id="HSG_NoBan_Past_Drugs_NoFedAssistanceHsg"></a>Housing applicants who were evicted for drug-related activity from any other type of housing or program that <em>does not receive federal government money</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1156" id="footnote-ref-1156">[1126]</a></sup></sup></ol>
              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT EXCEPTION TO THE RULE: PHA or owner <em>may</em> admit your household if the person whose drug-related criminal activity led to the eviction <em>later goes on to complete an approved, supervised drug rehabilitation program</em>, OR if your circumstances have changed.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1157" id="footnote-ref-1157">[1127]</a></sup></sup></strong> This is an important exception, because it gives you the power to change your situation!By taking and completing an approved drug rehabilitation program, you could become eligible for housing again, or <em>if your circumstances have changed. </em>“Changed circumstances” could mean:</p>
              <ul class="importantbox">The household member with the drug-related conviction has died or is in prison, and won’t return to the household.The applicant household has had no contact for a period of time and does not know the whereabouts of the former household member who was evicted for the drug-related activity.There could be other reasons the family should be allowed back into the housing if the person with the conviction is no longer in the picture or has been rehabilitated.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1158" id="footnote-ref-1158">[1128]</a></sup></sup></strong></ul>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>My application was denied by the PHA or the owner of government-assisted housing because of a past eviction from federal government-assisted property for drug-related criminal activity, but I think it was a mistake or that the ban is unreasonably long (more than 3 years). How do I challenge the denial?</strong></p>
              <ul class="textbox">You can challenge a denial because the ban is unreasonably long or because there was a mistake in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property relied on. Go to PG. 447 to learn how to challenge a denial by asking the PHA for an informal review hearing.Go to PG. 417 to learn about what kinds of mitigating information you should include with your application, and as proof of mitigating circumstances &amp; rehabilitation with any challenges you bring.If there was a mistake in the information the PHA or owner of the government-assisted property relied upon, you should immediately bring it to their attention. Mistakes could include errors in your criminal records (see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1132).</ul>
              <p><strong><strong>A NOTE ABOUT CHALLENGING UNREASONABLY LONG BANS FOR PAST DRUG-RELATED ACTIVITY ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED PROPERTY:</strong></strong></p>
              <ul class="textbox">If you were convicted of a less serious drug-related crime, such as mere possession, OR you have been rehabilitated (and can show you have changed, done classes, or improved yourself), these are all good reasons to challenge a ban that is significantly longer than 3 years. If you can, talk to a lawyer or advocate!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1159" id="footnote-ref-1159">[1129]</a></sup></sup> See General Guide Appendix A, on PG. 1286 of this guide for a list of legal aid providers in California. A lawyer can explain how to gather proof that shows the housing ban shouldn’t apply to you for more than 3 years. Again, go to PG. 408 to learn about the procedure for challenging a denial, and asking the PHA for an informal review hearing.</ul>
              <h4 class="subheading3">BAN 4: Current Illegal Drug Use  Required Ban while Illegal Drug Use is “Current” </h4>
              <p class="text">PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST DENY admission to an entire household if ANY MEMBER of the household is <em>currently</em> using illegal drugs.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1160" id="footnote-ref-1160">[1130]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
              <h5 class="question"><strong>QUESTIONS RELATED TO CURRENT DRUG USE:When does drug use or alcohol abuse disqualify me from getting into federal government-assisted housing?</strong></h5>
              <div class="textbox9"><em>Current drug use</em> on or near the property by any tenant, household member, person under the tenant’s control, or guest will disqualify you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1161" id="footnote-ref-1161">[1131]</a></sup></sup></span> “Current” means you used illegal drugs “recently enough to justify a reasonable belief” that you’re still using. In their written policies, PHAs and owners should spell out what they define as “recent,” and must abide by that policy. Read more about “recentness” requirements on PG. 482. To learn about how your past addiction could be a protected disability which allows you to ask for a “reasonable accommodation”—which means you can ask the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing to lift or relax this ban (see Appendix D, PG. 480).</div>
              <h5 class="question"><strong>How would PHA or owner find out about my alcohol or drug use?</strong></h5>
              <div class="textbox9">A PHA or owner could learn about your drug or alcohol use directly from you (in your application) or from access to records about your criminal history or drug treatment. To learn more about how a PHA or owner accesses records related to your alcohol or drug use, read Access to Your Drug/ Alcohol Records for Government-Assisted Housing on PG. 428.</div>
              <h5 class="question"><strong>Should I try to hide my current illegal drug use from the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing?</strong></h5>
              <div class="textbox9">No, you should be honest on the application. You can be denied the government-assisted housing—or later evicted (kicked out/terminated from the program)—for intentionally lying during the application process. </div>
              <h5 class="question"><strong>Do PHAs or owners of government-assisted housing consider whether I have participated in or completed a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program to let me into a housing program?</strong></h5>
              <p class="textbox">Generally, they don’t have to, but PHAs and owners may consider that you have participated in or have completed a drug rehabilitation program, and may ask you for documentation that you are not currently using illegal drugs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1162" id="footnote-ref-1162">[1132]</a></sup></sup> Specifically, you may have to provide documentation of your drug rehabilitation with your application if you want to avoid or reduce the 3+ year ban on admitting people who were previously evicted from federally-assisted housing due to a drug-related crime.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1163" id="footnote-ref-1163">[1133]</a></sup></sup> </p>
              <h5 class="question"><strong>Can PHAs or owners of government-assisted housing screen me by using or requiring a medical exam or drug test?</strong></h5>
              <p class="textbox">No. PHAs and owners may not require you to undergo any type of physical exam or medical testing in order to admit you to a housing program. This includes testing for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (Tb), pregnancy, and, presumably, drug/alcohol screening.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1164" id="footnote-ref-1164">[1134]</a></sup></sup> </p>
              <h4 class="textbox"><em>*** IF APPLYING TO GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING, <br/>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ANYONE WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD TO READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION ***</em></h4>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153147"></a>What bans are allowed, but not legally required in government-assisted housing—the “catch-all” category of<em> </em>bans that apply to *all people with criminal records*?</h3>
              <p class="text">For the many of you who do not fall into one of the required (“mandatory”) bans discussed above, it’s more likely you could get denied government-assisted housing because the Public Housing Authority (PHA) or the owner of the government-assisted housing has decided based on your criminal record that you <em>currently</em> “pose a risk to the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the property by other residents, the owner, or the PHA staff or agents/contractors.”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1165" id="footnote-ref-1165">[1135]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
              <p class="text">This is a “catch-all” category and allows the PHA or owner of government-assisted property to deny applicants with criminal histories more generally. They are allowed to consider a lot of information, including past convictions (even convictions you had expunged); arrests (even those that never led to a conviction); and in some cases your drug treatment records. See PG. 428 for detailed information about what criminal records a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted property can access about you.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153148"></a>How can I find out the criminal record policies of my local Public Housing Authority (PHA) or of the owner of government-assisted housing?</h3>
              <p class="textbox">REMEMBER THAT THESE “CATCH-ALL” BANS ARE NOT REQUIRED: <br/>This “catch-all” category is NOT a required ban. The PHA or owner is allowed to exclude you only if they can show that your criminal history poses a current threat to the health, safety, or peace of other residents, the owner, or PHA staff or agents/contractors. It’s recommended that they consider mitigating information and proof of your rehabilitation—and in the case of the Public Housing program, the PHA MUST consider such additional information!</p>
              <p class="text">Each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing will have different rules about what criminal history information they will ignore and what they will consider. By law, the PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing MUST put their policies <em>in writing</em> and make them available to applicants.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1166" id="footnote-ref-1166">[1136]</a></sup></sup> </p>
              <p class="text">The rules and policies of each local PHA and owner of government-assisted housing MUST not violate the legal protections discussed on PG. 428. Furthermore, the PHA must follow its own rules and policies. </p>
              <p class="text">You may want to consider talking to an advocate/lawyer about whether or not a particular PHA’s policies to exclude people with certain criminal records could be violating the law. (See PG. 1286 for a list of legal aid providers across California).</p>

              <p class="text">This also means that, for this application, when you are asked about any past convictions, you should list even those that have been <em>expunged</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1169" id="footnote-ref-1169">[1139]</a></sup></sup></span> If you lie or don’t include them, the PHA or owner can reject you during the housing application process <em>just for lying </em>OR the PHA or owner could evict you later if it finds out that you intentionally lied during the application.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1170" id="footnote-ref-1170">[1140]</a></sup></sup></span> </p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153150"></a>Under the “catch-all” ban, can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner deny me from government-assisted housing for arrests that did not result in a conviction?</h3>
              <p class="text">No.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1173" id="footnote-ref-1173">[1143]</a></sup></sup></span> A PHA or owner of government-assisted housing CANNOT deny, end assistance, or evict you based on <em>arrest records</em> alone.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1174" id="footnote-ref-1174">[1144]</a></sup></sup></span> Some PHAs or owners of government-assisted housing might ask about arrests, and some might not. But whatever the policy, the PHA or owner MUST be able to show that’s it is more probable than not that the <em>conduct underlying the arrest</em> occurred and that such conduct could <em>threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the building by other residents, the owner, or PHA staff or its agents/contractors</em>. This means the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing will need other forms of proof (beyond just the arrest record) that the conduct underlying the arrest occurred, because of course, an arrest is NOT legal proof that you actually committed a crime (unlike a conviction, which shows guilt).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1175" id="footnote-ref-1175">[1145]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
              <p class="text">If you were denied government-assisted housing based on arrest records alone (without more proof), you can challenge the denial, as this practice likely violates fair housing and anti-discrimination laws and/or your right to due process.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1176" id="footnote-ref-1176">[1146]</a></sup></sup></span> We suggest that you contact a housing attorney or legal aid organization that can help you (see the list of legal aid providers on PG. 1286). Whether or not you can find a lawyer to help you, you should try to get familiar with the procedure for challenging a PHA’s or government-assisted owner’s decision to deny you. For details on this process, see PG. 408.</p>

              <h3><a id="_Toc448153151"></a>Under the “catch-all” ban, will my participation in a pre-trial intervention or diversion program matter?</h3>
              <p class="text">If the program shows up on your background check as a conviction, then the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing can consider it, and possibly deny you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1177" id="footnote-ref-1177">[1147]</a></sup></sup></span><em> SO it depends on how it comes up on your background check.</em> </p>
              <ol class="text">If you are placed into a pre-trial intervention program and <em>you do NOT have to plead guilty in order to participate</em>, then a background check report will probably show the filing of a case, but no conviction while you are participating in the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1178" id="footnote-ref-1178">[1148]</a></sup> If you successfully complete the program, then your case will be dismissed without a conviction ever having been recorded. Therefore, it CANNOT show up as a conviction in a background check, because it never was one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1179" id="footnote-ref-1179">[1149]</a></sup></sup> If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1180" id="footnote-ref-1180">[1150]</a></sup></sup></ol>
              <ol class="text">If instead you are placed in a pre-trial intervention program that <em>requires you to plead guilty</em>, then this guilty plea will probably appear as a conviction on a background check report while you are still participating in the program. If you successfully complete the program, your guilty plea should be automatically withdrawn and those records sealed, after which a private background check company CANNOT report this as a conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1181" id="footnote-ref-1181">[1151]</a></sup></sup> If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1182" id="footnote-ref-1182">[1152]</a></sup></sup></ol>
