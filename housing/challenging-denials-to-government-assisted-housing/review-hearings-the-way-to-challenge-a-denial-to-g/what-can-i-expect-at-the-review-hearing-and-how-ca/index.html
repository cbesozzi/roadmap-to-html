        <h3><a id="_Toc448153233"></a>What can I expect at the review hearing? And how can I prepare?</h3>
        <p class="text"><strong>THE HEARING:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">Once I have sent in a written request for a review hearing, how can I prepare for the review hearing? </p>
        <p class="text">At the informal hearing or review, you are going to want to show the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing that you should not have been denied the housing because of mitigating circumstances/ proof of rehabilitation (see PG. 417), a disability that requires a reasonable accommodation (see Appendix D, PG. 480), or a mistake in the criminal records that the PHA or owner used (see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1141). Before the informal hearing/review, you should:</p>
        <ol class="text">Ask the PHA or owner for <em>all</em> documents and information regarding the denial of your housing application, including a copy of the criminal records it relied upon to deny you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1274" id="footnote-ref-1274">[1244]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Get a copy of your criminal record yourself to make sure it is correct. (For information on how to do this, see CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1154). </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Compare</em> your criminal record with the information the PHA or owner used to deny you.</ol>
        <ol class="text">At the same time, you will want to work on fixing any mistakes in the records used by the PHA or owner—or showing documentation of the errors. Records often have mistakes and you shouldn’t be denied housing for an error.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1275" id="footnote-ref-1275">[1245]</a></sup></sup> (See CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, PG. 1147.) This can take time, so you should act fast, and ask the PHA and/or owner of the government-assisted housing to hold the unit while you collect the documents you need.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Review your application &amp; be prepared to talk about important differences. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Make sure you know what you wrote on your application about your criminal record, illegal drug use, or whatever it was that made you get denied for the housing. For example, what did you say in response to the question about your convictions? What did you say about your illegal drug use? Whom did you say would live in your household? If the answer you gave on your application is not exactly the same as the answer you would give today, you must be able to explain why. If you didn’t include certain information about your criminal record in your application to the PHA or owner, you will have to explain why it was left out. Or if you said that a certain relative would be living with you who is not, you need to explain what has changed. </ol>
        <p class="text"><strong>IMPORANT:</strong> If you were denied under a ban that is allowed but not required, then you will want to prove to the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing that there are mitigating circumstances or evidence that you have changed and rehabilitated since the time of your offense. </p>
        <p class="text">If you were denied because of your criminal history, you should present evidence of rehabilitation to show the PHA you are <em>not</em> a threat to the health or safety of other residents, PHA staff or contractors. This includes all the letters and documents you can think of that will show how you have changed and grown since your negative conduct. You should get any of the following: letters of support.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1276" id="footnote-ref-1276">[1246]</a></sup></sup> Ask people who have supported you through reentry—like your current employer, a teacher, probation officer, social worker, neighbors, current or prior landlords, and community leaders-- to write a letter of support on your behalf. The letters should emphasize:</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT!</h4>
        <p class="sidebox"> You have the opportunity to tell the hearing officer why the decision he/she made is wrong</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">TIPS:</h4>
        <ul class="sidebox">Try to explain clearly what they missed, made mistake on, or why their decision was wrong.Be as composed and clear as possible.Bring a friend, witness, and/or lawyer or advocate if you can.</ul>
        <ol class="text">How your circumstances have changed since the negative conduct/ offense,</ol>
        <ol class="text">That you are a good person who gets along well with others,</ol>
        <ol class="text">That you are motivated to improve your life, <em>and</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">Your good performance or attendance record if you are in school or working.</ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153234"></a>What can I expect from the review hearing?<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1277" id="footnote-ref-1277">[1247]</a></sup></sup></strong> What is it like?</h3>
        <p class="text">Every hearing is different,<em> but generally, </em>the hearing is likely to be very informal (more details about these informal hearings below). It is <em>very different</em> from a court proceeding, and formal evidence rules do NOT apply. For example, the PHA or owner may introduce newspaper reports, police blotters, declarations or criminal records, with no one to authenticate or testify about the records.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1278" id="footnote-ref-1278">[1248]</a></sup></sup> You are also allowed to bring in any evidence showing why your criminal record should not bar you from getting into the housing program.</p>
        <p class="text">You are allowed, <em>and it’s recommended, </em>that you bring a friend or family member who can be supportive and can also be a witness to what is happening and what is said at the hearing.</p>
