          <p class="text">As required by law, Medi-Cal covers a set of “essential health benefits,” including:</p>
          <ol class="text">Hospital care and emergency services;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Medical services;</ol>
          <ol class="text">Prescription drugs;</ol>

          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintQualifying for Medi-Cal Because of a Disability:</h4>
          <p class="textbox"><a id="_Toc290728758"></a>If you think you qualify for Medi-Cal based on a disability, contact your county Medi-Cal office before you apply. Also, if you are homebound or living in an assisted care facility, you can ask to have a Medi-Cal representative visit you and help complete your application in person. For a statewide directory of county social services offices, see Appendix A, PG. 634.<sup><a href="#footnote-1485" id="footnote-ref-1485">[1455]</a></sup></p>
          <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintRetroactive Medi-Cal Coverage</h4>
          <p class="textbox">When applying for Medi-Cal benefits, you may request retroactive Medi-Cal coverage for medical services you received during any of the three calendar months immediately before the month that you applied to Medi-Cal, so long as the services would have qualified for coverage had you been enrolled in Medi-Cal at the time. If you do apply for retroactive benefits, you must complete a supplemental request form. You may request retroactive coverage when you apply for Medi-Cal or within one year of the last month for which retroactive coverage is sought.<sup><a href="#footnote-1486" id="footnote-ref-1486">[1456]</a></sup></p>
