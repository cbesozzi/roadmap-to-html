  <h1>Can I apply for CalWORKs while incarcerated?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125864"></a><a id="_Toc448153274"></a>Can I apply for CalWORKs while incarcerated?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">No. You can only apply for CalWORKs once you have been released from prison or jail, and you have active custody of a child as a parent or caretaker.<sup><a href="#footnote-1397" id="footnote-ref-1397">[1367]</a></sup> But if you’re currently incarcerated, you can and should look at the eligibility requirements so you are more aware of your options upon release.</p>
  
  <p class="text">You need to regain custody before you can apply for CalWORKs; and you can only have physical custody after you have been released. (To learn about how you can seek custody after release, go to the FAMILY LAW CHAPTER, PG. 881).</p>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox">EBT card lost or stolen?</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">If your EBT card is lost or stolen, or if you need to change your PIN, call (877) 328-9677</p>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125865"></a><a id="_Toc448153275"></a>How do I receive my CalWORKs benefits? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">If you are eligible for CalWORKs benefits, you will be issued your benefits on an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card unless you request that your benefits are directly deposited into your personal bank account. You will need to set up a PIN number for the card to use it, and can then use the card at most grocery stores and ATMs.<sup><a href="#footnote-1398" id="footnote-ref-1398">[1368]</a></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text">To avoid unnecessary fees and surcharges when withdrawing your CalWORKs cash, you should only use the card at ATMs with the “MoneyPass” symbol, or the same “Quest Mark” symbol that appears on the card-sleeve. To find free ATM locations, look for the appropriate symbol, ask your county worker, or visit the following website: <a href="http://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/Library/Cash_Access.pdf">http://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/Library/Cash_Access.pdf</a>.</p>
  
  <p class="sidebox"><img src="83.png"/>This “MoneyPass” symbol means it’s FREE to use your EBT card at that ATM location.</p>
  
  <p class="text">The “Quest Mark” symbol is on storefronts, checkout lanes, ATMs, and credit card machines to tell you that your EBT card can be used there.</p>
  
  <ol class="text">If the “Quest Mark” looks like this: . . . it’s only for cash benefits. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If the “Quest Mark” looks like this: . . . it’s only for CalFresh (food stamps) benefits. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If the “Quest Mark” looks like this: . . . it can be used for BOTH CalFresh and cash benefits.</ol>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125866"></a><a id="_Toc448153276"></a>Once I’m enrolled in CalWORKs, what rules must I follow to stay eligible? </h3>
  
  <h4 class="sidebox">TYPES OF CHANGES TO REPORt within 10 days</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">These kinds of changes include: moving to a new address; having someone join or leave your household; adding to your household a new member who has a drug-related felony, is in violation of a probation or parole condition, or is running from the law. </p>
  
  <p class="text">To keep getting CalWORKs benefits, you and your family must stay within income and resource limits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1399" id="footnote-ref-1399">[1369]</a></sup> In addition, you and all of the adults in your family must follow requirements related to Welfare-to-Work activities, reporting changes, and maintaining children’s access to health care and school.</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Welfare-to-Work:</em> Generally, you and any other adults in your family must participate in welfare-to-work activities for a certain number of hours per week. The hours and activities required of you will depend partly on your family situation, and partly on what county you live in (see PG. 555). In special cases, adults may be “exempt” (excused) from welfare-to-work requirements. You may be exempt if you are: disabled for 30+ days; under age 19 and attending school full-time; over age 60; caring for a relative’s child who is at risk of being put in foster care; OR caring for a sick or disabled person.<sup><a href="#footnote-1400" id="footnote-ref-1400">[1370]</a></sup> </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Reporting:</em> You must regularly report changes to your income and living situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1401" id="footnote-ref-1401">[1371]</a></sup> If both you and your child are on CalWORKs, you must report once every 6 months via a Semi-Annual Income Eligibility Report known as “SAR 7.” If only your child gets CalWORKs, you must report once a year. In addition, you must immediately report certain changes within 10 days. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Children: </em>If your child is under age 6, he or she must have all standard immunizations. If your child is of school age and under age 16, he or she must be attending school regularly.<sup><a href="#footnote-1402" id="footnote-ref-1402">[1372]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc290125867"></a><a id="_Toc448153277"></a>I believe my CalWORKs was wrongly denied or stopped. How do I appeal? </h3>
  
  <p class="text">If the county decides to deny your application, it must mail you a “Notice of Action” explaining why you were denied. It must do so within 30 days of receiving your application. If you disagree, you have the right to ask for a State Hearing to appeal (challenge) the denial. You must request a hearing within 90 days of the county’s decision.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1403" id="footnote-ref-1403">[1373]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <h4>Ways you can request a State hearing:</h4>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>By phone.</em> Call the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) at 1-800-952-5253 (TDD: 1-800-952-8349).</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>By mail. </em>Write your request on the back of the Notice of Action, or write a letter. Then<em> </em>mail your request to the county welfare agency’s address, which is on your Notice, or mail it to: CDSS Office of Hearings and Appeals; 744 P Street, M.S. 19-36; Sacramento, CA 95814. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>By fax. </em>Fax request to the CDSS State Hearings Division at 916-651-5210.<sup><a href="#footnote-1404" id="footnote-ref-1404">[1374]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <h4>Tips to remember when requesting a State hearing:</h4>
  
  <ol class="text">It’s recommended that you request a hearing <em>in writing</em>, so that there is a record of it. Keep a copy of your written request. </ol>
  
  <ol class="text">In your request, clearly state that you want a hearing, and briefly state your reason.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If you have a disability, note this in your request and specify any accommodations you will need. For example, if you need a large print of any official documents or a wheelchair-accessible room, write this in your request.<sup><a href="#footnote-1405" id="footnote-ref-1405">[1375]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <h4>Rights you have when requesting a State hearing:</h4>
  
  <ol class="text">You have a right to have the county welfare agency’s help, if you ask for it, with understanding how to appeal a decision about your case and what your next steps should be.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">You have a right to a free interpreter who will explain all procedures and also interpret for you at the hearing in your preferred language. If you want an interpreter, state this in your request, and specify your language.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">You have a right to choose a representative (such as a friend, family member, lawyer, or advocate) who will ask for a hearing on your behalf. You also have a right to bring anyone to your hearing if you do not want to go alone.<sup><a href="#footnote-1406" id="footnote-ref-1406">[1376]</a></sup></ol>

  <h4 class="sidebox">CalFresh Signing!</h4>
  
  <p class="sidebox">One adult household member (or authorized representative) must sign your CalFresh application under penalty of perjury. This means that if you knowingly told a lie (for example, lying about how many people live in your household), a criminal charge can be brought against you.</p>
  
  <p class="text">CalFresh is California’s “food stamps” program, providing money for low-income adults and their families to buy food. This program is part of the federal program called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).<sup><a href="#footnote-1407" id="footnote-ref-1407">[1377]</a></sup> Each county runs its own CalFresh program and issues food benefits (food stamps) in the form of a plastic Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, which looks and feels like a credit card. CalFresh includes the California Food Assistance Program (CFAP), which provides the same benefits as CalFresh but to <em>noncitizen legal permanent residents</em> (see PG. 522 for CFAP’s requirements).</p>
