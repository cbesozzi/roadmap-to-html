          <h3><a id="Expung_GovPardon_howdoIapplyforpardon"></a><a id="_Toc448153958"></a>What is the process for getting a pardon?</h3>
          <p class="text">How you go about getting a pardon depends on the type of pardon you are seeking. </p>
          <h5 class="numberboldblack">Pardon With Certificate of Rehabilitation</h5>
          <p class="text">You DO NOT have to do anything once you have your Certificate of Rehabilitation! When the judge grants your COR, he will also send a copy of your COR directly to the Governor’s Office. This will serve as your automatic application for a pardon AND as an official recommendation from the judge that the Governor should grant your pardon. You will not need to do anything else to apply.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3134" id="footnote-ref-3134">[3098]</a></sup></sup> Once the Governor receives a copy of your COR, s/he can do any of the following:</p>
          <ol class="text">Grant your pardon immediately (if you have no more than 1 felony conviction);<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3135" id="footnote-ref-3135">[3099]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">Do an investigation and review your case to decide whether to grant your pardon; OR</ol>
          <ol class="text">Ask the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) to investigate your case and make a recommendation about whether you should receive a pardon (see below under “Traditional or Direct Pardon”).<sup><a href="#footnote-3136" id="footnote-ref-3136">[3100]</a></sup> </ol>
          <h5 class="numberboldblack"><a id="Expung_GovPardon_Direct_Traditional"></a>Traditional or Direct Pardon (without a Certificate of Rehabilitation)</h5>
          <p class="text">You need to complete a formal application for a pardon –called an “<em>Application for Gubernatorial Pardon</em>.” If you are not eligible for a Certificate of Rehabilitation, or if any of the following apply to you, this is the only way to apply for a pardon from the Governor: </p>
          <ol class="text">Your conviction is from California but you do NOT currently live in California;</ol>
          <ol class="text">You were released from prison or onto parole before May 13, 1943; OR</ol>
          <ol class="text">You are serving a life sentencing without the possibility of parole, and you have 2 or more felony convictions.<sup><a href="#footnote-3137" id="footnote-ref-3137">[3101]</a></sup></ol>
          <p class="text">For instructions on how to complete a formal application for a traditional or direct pardon, see APPENDIX W, on PG. 1258.</p>
          <h5 class="numberboldblack">BPH-Recommended Pardon </h5>
          <p class="text">You cannot apply for a BPH-recommended pardon yourself—the BPH must recommend you to the Governor on its own.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3138" id="footnote-ref-3138">[3102]</a></sup></sup> However, you may be able to show the BPH that you deserve to be recommended for a pardon. If you have a BPH hearing, it’s recommended that you bring evidence (such as documents, certificates, or letters) showing:</p>
          <ol class="text">That you were a victim of domestic violence and it led to your offense; </ol>
          <ol class="text">Your extraordinarily good conduct or amazing accomplishments while incarcerated; or</ol>
          <ol class="text">Other special and unusual circumstances surrounding your conviction or sentence.</ol>
