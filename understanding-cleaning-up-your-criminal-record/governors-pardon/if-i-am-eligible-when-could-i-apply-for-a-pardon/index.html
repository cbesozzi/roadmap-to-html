  <p>
    If I am eligible, when could I apply for a pardon?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When you can/ should apply for a pardon depends on the type of pardon you are seeking.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pardon with Certificate of Rehabilitation
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Since a Certificate of Rehabilitation acts as an automatic application for a pardon, as soon as you are granted your COR, it will be forwarded straight to the Governor as a pardon request —and you don’t need to do anything else! If you do NOT have a Certificate of Rehabilitation yet, but your conviction is eligible for one, you can apply for a COR as soon as you’ve completed your period of rehabilitation. (For more information on getting a Certificate of Rehabilitation, see PG. 1184.) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Traditional or Direct Pardon (without Certificate of Rehabilitation)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can apply for a pardon directly from the Governor after you have been off probation or parole for 10 years, with NO criminal activity during that period.[3097] The 10 year requirement will only be waived (excused) in very rare situations (under “extraordinary and compelling circumstances”). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BPH-Recommended Pardon
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The BPH can only recommend you for a pardon while you are still incarcerated. There is no specific time frame for when the BPH can recommend you for a pardon, but it would likely be after the BPH has a chance to consider information about your case (for example, after you’ve had at least one BPH hearing).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If (or when) you have a BPH hearing, you can bring any evidence showing why you deserve to receive a pardon, based on your good conduct, accomplishments, the circumstances of your conviction, or your sentence. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are no longer in prison, you are not eligible for a BPH recommendation for a pardon.
