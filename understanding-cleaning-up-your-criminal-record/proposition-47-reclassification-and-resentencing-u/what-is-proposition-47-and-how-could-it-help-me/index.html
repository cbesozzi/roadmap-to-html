    What is Proposition 47 and how could it help me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Proposition 47 (Prop 47) is a law that was passed by voters in California and took effect in November of 2014.[2987] Prop 47 changed the law so that certain non-violent offenses that previously could be charged as “wobblers” or straight felonies now can only be charged as straight misdemeanors. Prop 47 also applies to past convictions, which means that you might be able to get your past felony convictions changed to misdemeanors if they meet the requirements under the new law. If you are still serving a sentence for a conviction that qualifies for Prop 47, you may be able to get your sentence reduced.

    IMPORTANT UPDATE:  The deadline to file Prop 47 applications has been extended to November 4, 2022!
