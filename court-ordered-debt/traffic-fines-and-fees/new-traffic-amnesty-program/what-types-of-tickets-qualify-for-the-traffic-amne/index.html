  <p>
    What types of tickets qualify for the Traffic Amnesty Program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Traffic Amnesty Program applies to all adult and juvenile[2192] vehicle code infractions[2193] (minor driving violations) due to be paid on or before January 1, 2013,[2194] as long as they were handled by a traffic court.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ANY person who is eligible to have a CA driver license, including undocumented persons who are eligible for an “AB 60 Driver License,” can apply for and get relief under the law (so long as the ticket qualifies). 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other non-traffic infractions that were unrelated to driving could also qualify (like tickets for sleeping on the sidewalk, jaywalking, loitering, or turnstile jumping) but this all depends on the county.[2195] Some misdemeanors may also qualify depending on your county.[2196]
