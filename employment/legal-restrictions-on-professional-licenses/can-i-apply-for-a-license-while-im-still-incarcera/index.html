          <h3><a id="_Toc448153473"></a>Can I apply for a license while I’m still incarcerated?</h3>
          <h4 class="sidebox">Special program for getting your cosmetology license while incarcerated</h4>
          <p class="sidebox">If you are incarcerated at Valley State Prison, California Women’s Institute, or Central California Women’s Facility (Chowchilla), there is a special program that can help you to get your cosmetology license while you’re incarcerated. You can complete your training school AND take the licensing examination in these facilities—meaning it is possible to already have your license in hand by the time you’re released.IMPORTANT: This program does NOT stop the licensing board from considering your criminal conviction, and does NOT change any of the other qualifications to get your license. In other words, the licensing board can still deny you a license if the board decides that your conviction is substantially related to the duties and responsibilities of a cosmetologist. </p>
          <p class="text">It depends.<strong> </strong>Each licensing board has different rules and requirements. Some may require you to wait a certain amount of time after your conviction or release before you can be eligible.<sup><a href="#footnote-1949" id="footnote-ref-1949">[1919]</a></sup> In addition, most boards will consider the amount of time that has passed since your conviction, and may give more weight to time after you were released or once you were off supervision.<sup><a href="#footnote-1950" id="footnote-ref-1950">[1920]</a></sup></p>
          <p class="text">For this reason, even if you’re not specifically required to wait, you still may be more successful if you wait to apply until after you’re released.</p>
