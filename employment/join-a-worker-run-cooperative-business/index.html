<h1>Join a worker-run cooperative business</h1>

<h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153482"></a>Join a worker-run cooperative business</h2>

<p class="text">A worker cooperative is a business that is owned and controlled by its workers. In other words, the workers are both the employees AND the employer. Usually, workers run the day-to-day operations of the business—such as making business decisions, assigning tasks to each person, etc., as well as the business’s finances. Although each person has a different level of responsibility, all workers are considered to be equal members and have equal power within the business.</p>

<p class="text">Any business can be a worker-owned and controlled cooperative. Worker co-ops have been successful in many different industries. Some examples are:</p>

<ol class="text">Service—housecleaning, day labor, restaurants, taxis, childcare</ol>

<ol class="text">Farming and food production—urban or community farms, community-supported agriculture programs, bakeries, restaurants</ol>

<ol class="text">Retail—grocery stores, bookstores, bike shops</ol>

<ol class="text">Health care—nursing, home health care, clinics, bodywork</ol>

<ol class="text">Skilled trades—printing, plumbing, woodworking, contracting</ol>

<ol class="text">Manufacturing and engineering—machine parts, fabricating</ol>

<ol class="text">Technology—web hosting, networking, voice and data systems</ol>

<ol class="text">Education—charter schools, teacher/student/parent-run schools</ol>

<ol class="text">Media and the arts—designers, galleries, performers, publishers</ol>
