    I am not a U.S. citizen, and I am told I have an outstanding detainer against me. What is a detainer? What could happen to me?
  </p>

    An ICE detainer is a written request by immigration officials to a local jail or other law enforcement agency that the agency detain an individual for an additional 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) after his or her release date so that ICE officials can decide whether to take the individual into federal custody and begin formal deportation proceedings.

    Even if you have a detainer against you, the USPC may still grant you release onto federal parole if you meet the other criteria in 28 C.F.R. § 2.18. The presence of a detainer is not in itself a valid reason for the denial of parole.[905]

  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you have an acceptable plan for community supervision, you can be released into the community if the detaining officials remove the detainer or don’t pick you up[906]
