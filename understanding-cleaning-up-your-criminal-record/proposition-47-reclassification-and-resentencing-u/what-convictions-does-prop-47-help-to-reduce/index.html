  <p>
    What convictions does Prop 47 help to reduce?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In general, Prop 47 applies to the following offenses:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Second Degree Burglary—Penal Code Section 459
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Forgery—Penal Code Sections 470, 475, 476
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Forgery, writing bad checks—Penal Code Section 476a
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Grand Theft—Penal Code Section 487
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Receiving Stolen Property—Penal Code Section 496(a)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Petty Theft with a Prior—Penal Code Section 666
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possession of Drugs for Personal Use—Health & Safety Code Section 11350
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possession of Concentrated Cannabis—Health & Safety Code Section 11357(a)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possession of Meth—Health & Safety Code Section 11377
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As of November 2014, anyone charged with one of these offenses can only be charged with a misdemeanor—NOT a felony. If you have a felony conviction for any of these offenses from before November of 2014, you may be able to get it changed to a misdemeanor under Prop 47 (called “reclassification”). If you are currently serving a felony sentence for a conviction of any of these offenses from before November 2014, you may be able to get your sentence reduced to a misdemeanor sentence (called “resentencing”). (For more information about how Prop 47 changes each of these offenses, see PG. 1180.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A Court of Appeal in California decided that the Prop 47 reclassification law applies equally to juveniles with offenses covered by Prop 47.[2988] This means that both juveniles AND adults can get eligible felonies reduced under Prop 47. Additionally, you can call your local Public Defender’s office for more information about Prop 47 in your county.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: Your conviction will NOT qualify for Prop 47 if you also have a conviction for certain serious felony offenses. Below is a list of offenses that will disqualify you from using Prop 47 to get your felony conviction reduced to a misdemeanor.
