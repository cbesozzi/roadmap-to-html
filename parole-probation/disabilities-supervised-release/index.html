        <h1>Disabilities & Supervised Release</h1>
        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153044"></a>Disabilities &amp; Supervised Release</h2>
        <p>If you have a disability and are under federal community supervision of any kind (including federal probation, supervised release, or federal parole), please go to PG. 286 to learn about your rights.</p>
        <h2><a id="PP_Federal_FederalParole_heading"></a><a id="_Toc448153045"></a>Federal community supervision: federal parolE</h2>
        <p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 eliminated federal parole for most people convicted of a federal crime. Now, instead of defendant’s serving an indeterminate sentence (i.e., one where a parole board determines how much of the Judge’s sentence you serve), all federal defendants serve 85% of his or her sentence. This is much like “mandatory release” discussed below. <em>See </em>the information on “RELEASE PLANNING” at Appendix II, PG. 365. In light of the Sentencing Reform Act, only a few groups of individuals are serving a federal parole sentences. </p>
