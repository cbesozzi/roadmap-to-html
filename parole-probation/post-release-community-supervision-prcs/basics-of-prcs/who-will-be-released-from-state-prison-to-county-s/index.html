  <h2><a href="/parole-probation/post-release-community-supervision-prcs/basics-of-prcs/who-will-be-released-from-state-prison-to-county-s/index.html">Who will be released from state prison to county supervision on PRCS?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Who will be released from state prison to county supervision on PRCS?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The following people will be released from state prison onto PRCS supervision: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Individuals currently serving terms for non-violent, non-serious commitment offenses;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some sex offenders; AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Individuals who, prior to October 1, 2011, would have been placed on non-revocable parole (NRP).[642]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT NOTE: If you were paroled from state prison before October 1, 2011, you will stay on parole, and not be placed on PRCS. However, if you are returned to the custody of state prison due to a parole revocation case, the CDCR will screen your case beginning at least 180 days before your calculated release date (see the next question about this timeline) to decide if you should be (1) returned to state parole or (2) placed on PRCS after serving the revocation term.[643]
