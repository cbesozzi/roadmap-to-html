  <p>
    Under the “catch-all” ban, can a Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing deny my application because of the convictions of family members who live with me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. You can be excluded from federal government-assisted housing for the convictions of family members who are part of the current household.[1153]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the person no longer lives with you, you should NOT be denied because of their convictions, but you may have to prove that he or she is not part of the household anymore.[1154]
