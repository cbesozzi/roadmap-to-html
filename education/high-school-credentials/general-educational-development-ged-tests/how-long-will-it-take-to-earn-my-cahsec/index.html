          <p class="text">It depends<em>.</em> Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, and individual circumstances. You may choose to study on your own, at your own pace; or you may take one or more GED test preparation classes, which may be designed to get you ready by a specific date. </p>

However, this may or may not be the best fit for you, depending on your needs and learning preferences.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2716" id="footnote-ref-2716">[2683]</a></sup></p>
