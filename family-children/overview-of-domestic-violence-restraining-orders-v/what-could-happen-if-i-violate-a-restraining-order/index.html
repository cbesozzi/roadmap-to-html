  <p>
    What could happen if I violate a restraining order against me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you violate the restraining order, you may go to jail, pay a fine, or both.[2515] A violation can be in MANY different ways, make sure you review the order and against you and know what you can and cannot do. Violations of a protective order can include contacting the person through social media even if it is just tagging a protected person in a picture or a comment. Violation of a protective order may also be leaving messages or being in the physical area of a protected person. A court may determine that you violated a protective order even if you respond to a message sent by the protected person. With all of these things in mind, the most simple instruction is to do not contact or respond to a person who has a restraining order against you in ANY manner.
