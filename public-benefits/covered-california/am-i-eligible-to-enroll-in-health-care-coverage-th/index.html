  <p>
    Am I eligible to enroll in health care coverage through Covered California?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To get health care through Covered California, you must be:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A California resident;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Lawfully present in the United States;[1412]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Age 18 or older, and 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Not currently incarcerated.[1413] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Based on your household size and income, your family may qualify for financial assistance to help you afford health care. By submitting a Covered California application, you’ll find out exactly what kinds of assistance you can get, and how much.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS: If you have one of these statuses, you may qualify for health coverage through Covered California: lawful permanent resident (“Green Card holder”); lawful temporary resident (“LTR”); asylee or applicant for asylum; refugee; Cuban/Haitian entrant; paroled into the U.S.; conditional entrant granted before 1980; battered spouse, child or parent; victim of trafficking or that person’s spouse, child, sibling, or parent; individual with non-immigrant status (including worker or student visa holders); Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) or applicant for TPS; Deferred Enforced Departure (“DED”); deferred action status; individual granted withholding of deportation/removal; applicant for withholding of deportation/removal; applicant for special immigrant juvenile status; applicant for adjustment to LPR status, with approved visa petition; registry applicant with Employment Authorization Document (EAD); applicant for cancellation of removal or suspension of deportation. Even if your immigration status is not listed above, you may still qualify for health insurance and should still apply!
