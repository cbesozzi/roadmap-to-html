          <h3><a id="_Toc317247513"></a><a id="_Toc448153612"></a>Are there convictions that will automatically ban me from reconnecting with my child in probate court?</h3>
          <p class="text">Yes, there are certain convictions that will automatically ban you from reconnecting with your child. See the chart on PG. 894 for more information. </p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc317247514"></a><a id="_Toc448153613"></a>What can I do to show the probate court judge that custody or visitation with me is in the “best interest of the child”?</h3>
          <p class="text">It can help to clearly explain the things that make you a positive person in the child’s life. You can emphasize your ability to care for the child, the strength of your relationship with the child, the stability you can bring to the child’s life, and why it is best for the child to live or visit with you. If possible, you should also talk to a lawyer. To find a free legal aid organization in your area, see Appendix A, PG. 981, for places that may be able to help.</p>
          <h3><a id="_Toc317247515"></a><a id="_Toc448153614"></a>What can I do to show mitigating circumstances and rehabilitative evidence related to my criminal record?</h3>
          <p class="text">As stated in the family court section on PG. 922, You can show the judge anything that indicates that giving you custody or visitation will be in the best interests of your child. You can show the judge things like: certificates earned during incarceration, letters to and from your child, letters of support from family and friends, documents that show attendance in self-help groups, proof of employment.<sup><a href="#footnote-2348" id="footnote-ref-2348">[2316]</a></sup> However, if you have a conviction that automatically bans you from getting custody or visitation with your child, then mitigating evidence will not be considered. See PG. 894 for a list of convictions that will automatically bar you from getting custody or visitation.</p>
