  <h1>What is “expungement”(a dismissal) in California?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448153909"></a>What is “expungement”(a dismissal) in California?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Expungement (also called dismissal) is a way to <em>clean up your record</em>, by <em>limiting</em> the criminal history information that <em>certain</em> people can see in your <em>background check</em><sup><a href="#footnote-2931" id="footnote-ref-2931">[2897]</a></sup><em> </em>and relieves you of some of the consequences associated with your conviction. </p>
  
  <p class="text">An expungement is also called a “dismissal” because your case is actually reopened by the court, the “finding of guilt” (your guilty or no contest plea, or guilty verdict) is withdrawn, and a plea of <em>not guilty</em> is entered. The court will then dismiss your case, and your record will be changed to show a dismissal (under Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4) rather than a conviction. </p>
  
  <p class="text">Getting your conviction expunged hides the conviction from certain people when they run a <em>background check</em> on you. For example, most private employers are NOT allowed to see a conviction that has been expunged.<sup><a href="#footnote-2932" id="footnote-ref-2932">[2898]</a></sup> Additionally, most private employers CANNOT ask you about, or even consider, a conviction that has been expunged when you apply for a job.<sup><a href="#footnote-2933" id="footnote-ref-2933">[2899]</a></sup> For information on how to get a conviction expunged, see PG. 1171.</p>
  
  <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Expungement does NOT erase the offense from your criminal record or RAP sheet. But it DOES <em>change</em> your record to show the conviction was dismissed.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2934" id="footnote-ref-2934">[2900]</a></sup></strong></p>
