<h1>Additional Laws That Apply to All People on State Parole</h1>

<p>
  Additional Laws That Apply to All People on State Parole
</p>

<p>
  In addition to general conditions, there are other laws that impact the civil rights of all people on state parole. These won’t be listed on your CDCR Form 1515: Notice and Conditions of Parole (the form your parole agent gives you upon release), but they are just as important.
</p>

<p>
  What other laws & restrictions apply to all people on state parole?
</p>

<p>
  IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS UPDATE!
</p>

<p>
  Recently, the California Supreme Court ruled that this voting ban applies only to people incarcerated in state prison (or in jail awaiting transfer to serve state prison sentences) and people on state parole. It does NOT apply to people otherwise incarcerated in jail, or to people on county-level probation, including mandatory supervision or post-release community supervision (PRCS). (See Scott et al. v. Bowen (2015).) This is a brand new ruling that extended voting rights to many more people in California! Read more on PG. 83 of the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER.
</p>

<p>
  Additional laws and restrictions that apply to you and all people on state parole are:
</p>

<p>
  YOU CANNOT VOTE — In California, people who are on parole (or currently incarcerated) may not vote in any elections.[431] Outside of California, people with felony convictions may vote in some elections but not others. Voting laws vary by state, so if you ever move to a new state, you should look into that state’s voting requirements. (To learn more about voting rights in California, and to see a chart of who can vote based on the supervision they’re on, go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID & VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 83.)
</p>

<p>
  YOU CANNOT SERVE ON A JURY — In California, people with felony convictions cannot serve on juries, even after they have been discharged from parole.[432] This means you may not be able to serve on a jury for the rest of your life (unless the law changes).
</p>

<p>
  Is there any way to get back my right to serve on a jury?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. You may be able to restore your right to serve on a jury in California. Depending on your situation, you might be able to:
</p>

<p>
  Have your felony reduced to a misdemeanor (misdemeanors don’t prevent you from serving on a jury in California); or
</p>

<p>
  Apply for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (COR), which automatically includes an application for a Governor’s Pardon. A COR won’t restore your right to serve on a jury, but a Governor’s Pardon will.
</p>

<p>
  Apply directly for a Governor’s Pardon, which will restore your right to serve on a jury.[433]
</p>

<p>
  (For more information on all three of these possible remedies, see the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1132.)
</p>

<p>
  YOU CANNOT BE ON PRISON GROUNDS WITHOUT APPROVAL — In California, it is a crime for a former prisoner to be on prison grounds for any reason without the warden’s prior approval.[434] To obtain permission to visit, you must get written approval from your parole agent and send it to the warden, along with a letter requesting the warden’s permission and a completed visiting questionnaire (CDCR Form 106, see Appendix O, PG. 323).[435]
</p>

<p>
  GENERAL VS. SPECIAL CONDITIONSAside from the general conditions of parole, are there other special conditions that could be imposed on me?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. There are discretionary special conditions that your parole agent can impose on you as long as these conditions meet certain legal standards (see PG. 290). There are also mandatory special conditions that are imposed on certain categories of individuals, as required by California state law. Continue reading below for more information about special conditions. 
</p>

<p>
  Special Conditions of State Parole: Conditions that apply ONLY to certain People on parole
</p>

<p>
  DO YOU THINK THAT A special PAROLE CONDITION IS VIOLATING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS?
</p>

<p>
  Go to PG. 188 to learn how to challenge a parole condition, which you can do either from prison or when you are out in the community.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) or a parole agent may impose special parole conditions that add EXTRA limitations to a person’s life. This section explains when special conditions may be applied, and what rights you have against these conditions.
</p>

<p>
  Who sets special parole conditions, and how do they decide?
</p>

<p>
  CAN I ASK FOR MY SUPERVISION LEVEL TO BE REVIEWED or REDUCED?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. Most parolees who complete 180 days of satisfactory parole will automatically be assigned to the “minimum supervision” category — EXCEPT for people whose commitment offense is legally classified as “violent” (see Cal. Penal Code § 667.5); 290 registrants (see Cal. Penal Code § 290); people with cases that received a lot of media or public attention, and certain gang members (as documented on CDCR Form 812-A). Even if you are not automatically assigned to “minimum supervision” after 180 days of completing satisfactory parole, you can ask the unit supervisor to reduce your supervision level, and he or she will make a decision on your case. (Cal. Penal Code § 3504.)
</p>

<p>
  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and individual parole agents can require you to follow certain special conditions, which are special rules you must follow while on parole.[436] 
</p>

<p>
  If you are a “lifer” in California, or if you were released onto parole before July 1, 2013, or if you were charged with a parole violation before July 1, 2013,[437] then the BPH can require you to follow certain special parole conditions.[438] 
</p>

<p>
  If you are not a “lifer,” county Superior Court judges are in charge of handling your parole conditions and revocations of your parole.[439] Superior Court judges may impose special parole conditions, but these special conditions must be “reasonably related” to your commitment offense (the offense for which you spent time in prison), your “criminogenic needs” (issues that affect your risk of recidivism, such as substance abuse, family ties, and social relationships), and your criminal history.[440] 
</p>

<p>
  Special conditions required by CDCR and/or your parole agent will depend on your individual circumstances, including your commitment offense, your criminogenic needs, your criminal history,[441] specific conditions required by law (called mandatory special condititions — see the box below for more information), and other parole expectations. Your special conditions will be part of your parole plan, and they can change depending on how well you do on parole.[442] (See the next question to learn about what your parole plan is.)
