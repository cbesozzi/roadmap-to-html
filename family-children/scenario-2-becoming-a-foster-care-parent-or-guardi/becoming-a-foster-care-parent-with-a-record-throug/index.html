<p class="text">Foster care is a system run by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) that provides temporary homes for children who cannot live with family or a legal guardian. A child in foster care was removed from his or her home by Child Protective Services (CPS) because the child’s parents were <em>unable, unwilling or unfit</em> to care for the child. The goal of foster care is to reunify the child with his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) OR find another suitable permanent living arrangement. This may include an adoptive home, long-term guardianship, or living with a relative.</p>

<ol class="text">For more information on adoption, see PG. 947.</ol>

<ol class="text">For more information on guardianship, see PG. 927. </ol>

    Who can be a child’s foster parent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To become a foster parent in California, you need to get a license from the California Department of Social Services and pass a criminal background check.[2366]

  <p>
    How could my criminal record affect my ability to become a foster parent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your past conviction(s) may prevent you from becoming a foster parent.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you want to become a child’s foster care parent through the dependency court, your criminal record will be a factor both in (1) your ability to get the required state license from the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to be a foster parent AND (2) whether the dependency court judge decides that it is in the “best interest of the child” for you to be their foster parent.[2367]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For a list of convictions the WILL or MAY prevent you from becoming a foster parent, see PG. 894
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For more information on what a dependency court judge looks at when deciding what is in the “best interest of a child,” see PG. 906
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Before you apply for a foster care license, get a complete record of your convictions. This is important so that you can make sure that your record is correct and so that you can begin, if possible, dismissing convictions from your record if possible.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For information on cleaning up your record, see the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER on PG. 1132.

  <p>
    What is the background check process for potential foster parents?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In order to become a foster parent in California, you need to get a license from the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) and pass a criminal background check.[2368] Prospective foster parents, as well as anyone else who will have contact with the foster child, must provide two sets of fingerprints to the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ)—one set is to run a state record check and one set is to perform a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) national check.[2369]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to checking a person’s criminal history, the CA DOJ checks the Child Abuse Registry and reports to the CDSS any previous complaints for the CDSS to further investigate.[2370] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PLEASE NOTE: The same background check rules and process apply to a person living in a foster home OR providing childcare to a foster child, even if that person is not the foster parent him/herself[2371]

  <p>
    What convictions will bar me from becoming a foster parent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At first, any conviction will stop you from becoming a foster parent, until you have received an “exemption” from the state (which is only given for certain convictions).[2372] For some convictions, you can ask for an “exemption” from CDSS—but many convictions will automatically ban you from becoming a foster parent.[2373]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Convictions that will automatically ban you from becoming a foster parent include:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Murder;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Manslaughter;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Voluntary manslaughter;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Kidnapping;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rape;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sexual battery; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All crimes requiring registration as a sex offender.[2374]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For a full list of the convictions that will automatically bar you from becoming a foster parent, see Appendix H, on PG. 1007.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are unsure if your conviction will prevent you from becoming a foster parent, talk to a lawyer, Family Law/Self-Help Facilitator (see a list of local contact information in Appendix A, PG. 981), or your local county CPS agency.

  <p>
    If you have a criminal conviction on your record, you may still be able to become a foster parent if you apply for an “exemption.”[2375] When reviewing your application for an exemption, the California Department of Social Services will asses whether you have good character and are rehabilitated. The following factors will be considered when making that determination:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The nature of the crime. 	
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Period of time since the crime was committed and number of offenses. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime that would demonstrate that repetition is not likely. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Activities since conviction, including employment or participation in therapy or education, that would indicate changed behavior. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Granting by the Governor of a full and unconditional pardon. For more information on a pardon from the Governor, see PG. 1188 in the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Character references. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A certificate of rehabilitation from a superior court. For more information on how to get a certificate of rehabilitation and what it means, see PG 1184 in the UNDERSTANDING & CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     Evidence of honesty and truthfulness as revealed in exemption application documents and interviews.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Documents include, but are not limited to:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A Criminal Record Statement (LIC 508D, Criminal Record Statement); and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The person's written statement/explanation of the conviction and the circumstances surrounding the arrest. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Evidence of honesty and truthfulness as revealed in exemption application interviews and conversations between the person or others and the Department.[2376]
