  <p>
    What are professional and occupational licenses and what do they require?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In California, people who work in certain jobs are required to get a license from the state to do so. There are over 200 professions in California that require a professional or occupational license—ranging from barbers and cosmetologists, to security guards, contractors, teachers, nurses, doctors and lawyers. Professional and occupational licenses are granted and regulated by different licensing boards, agencies, and bureaus (over 40 in total, each for a different industry), all under the control of the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).[1908]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Applying for a professional or occupational license generally requires submitting fingerprints, paying application fees, and proving that you meet certain educational and/or work experience requirements, which are set by the particular licensing board to which you’re applying.[1909]
