  <h1>What are the main types of supervision in California?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448152776"></a>What are the main types of supervision in California?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">There are 4 main categories of supervision in California. They are:</p>
  
  <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STATE PAROLE: </span>In California, parole is a condition of release for many people coming out of prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-313" id="footnote-ref-313">[313]</a></sup> It only applies in felony cases when a person is sentenced to state prison. It also only takes effect after release from prison.</p>
  
  <p class="text">People sentenced to serve <em>determinate sentences </em>— such as an exact term of “seven years” — serve the specified amount of time in prison ordered by the judge. Once their sentence is over, they are released.</p>
  
  <p class="text">People sentenced to serve indeterminate terms, such as “25 to life with the possibility of parole,” are released only after a Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) determines that they are ready to re-enter society.<sup><a href="#footnote-314" id="footnote-ref-314">[314]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">Most people released from California state prison are required to serve a period of parole after they are released. People on parole — called “parolees” — remain under the control of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s (CDCR) Division of Adult Parole Operations (DAPO). People on parole are supervised by CDCR parole agents, and must meet certain requirements or “conditions” of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-315" id="footnote-ref-315">[315]</a></sup></p>
  
  <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">COUNTY PROBATION &amp; NEW FORMS OF COUNTY-LEVEL SUPERVISION:</span> Probation is a type of supervision that a judge orders at trial as <em>part of the original sentence</em>, either as an alternative to incarceration OR in addition to incarceration.<sup><a href="#footnote-316" id="footnote-ref-316">[316]</a></sup> California probation reduces or eliminates the time that a person must spend in custody in jail or prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-317" id="footnote-ref-317">[317]</a></sup> People on probation must report to their county probation office (for more about formal probation, go to PG. 215) or to local superior court (for more about informal probation, go to PG. 210), and must meet certain requirements or “conditions” of probation. Depending on the circumstances, either the court or a probation officer monitors the person’s compliance with his or her probation terms. Informal probation, formal probation, mandatory supervision, and post-release community supervision (PRCS) are all types of community supervision that fall under the responsibility of California’s county probation departments. Unlike state parole offices, which are all operated by CDCR and DAPO, county probation departments have a lot more independence and differences between them. Here is a quick overview of the different types of county probation:</p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>INFORMAL PROBATION: Informal probation is a type of supervision for some misdemeanor convictions in which you are supervised by the court, not by a probation officer.It is also called “court,” “summary,” and “misdemeanor” probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-318" id="footnote-ref-318">[318]</a></sup></strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>FORMAL PROBATION: Formal probation is a type of supervision for felony and some misdemeanor convictions in which you are supervised by a probation officer <sup><a href="#footnote-319" id="footnote-ref-319">[319]</a></sup></strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>POST-RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION (PRCS): If you are released from state prison after incarceration for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual crime, you are placed under supervision by county probation officers, instead of being placed on state parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-320" id="footnote-ref-320">[320]</a></sup> This is called post-release community supervision (PRCS). PRCS can last up to 3 years, but it can end earlier if you do not violate any conditions of your PRCS.<sup><a href="#footnote-321" id="footnote-ref-321">[321]</a></sup></strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>MANDATORY SUPERVISION: In California, through a process called “split sentencing,” a judge can split the time of a sentence between a jail term and a period of supervision by a county probation officer. This type of supervision is called mandatory supervision.</strong></p>
  
  <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">FEDERAL PROBATION</span>: People convicted of certain federal offenses may be sentenced to federal probation or supervised release. The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System oversees federal probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-322" id="footnote-ref-322">[322]</a></sup></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>FEDERAL PROBATION: After you are convicted of a federal crime, federal probation is used as an alternative sentence <em>to prison time</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-323" id="footnote-ref-323">[323]</a></sup></sup> This means federal probation is a type of sentence in itself. If you are on federal probation, you must report to your assigned probation office <em>and</em> comply with the conditions of your federal probation.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-324" id="footnote-ref-324">[324]</a></sup></sup> </strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>SUPERVISED RELEASE: Supervised release is overseen by federal district courts with the help of federal probation officers.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-325" id="footnote-ref-325">[325]</a></sup></sup> The judge can sentence you to a term of supervised release <em>after your release from federal prison</em>.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-326" id="footnote-ref-326">[326]</a></sup></sup> In other words, a term of supervised release does not <em>replace</em> any part of your prison term; rather, a judge orders supervised release <em>in addition to</em> any prison term you may serve.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-327" id="footnote-ref-327">[327]</a></sup></sup> In some cases, the judge who sentences you is actually <em>required by law</em> to impose a term of supervised release in addition to a prison term.<sup><a href="#footnote-328" id="footnote-ref-328">[328]</a></sup> It’s common for a federal sentence to include a prison term, followed by a period of supervised release.</strong></p>
  
  <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">FEDERAL PAROLE:</span> Although federal parole was officially eliminated in 1984, certain categories of people may still be on federal parole. These categories include: (1) people who were sentenced in federal court before November 1, 1987; (2) people who violate criminal laws in Washington, DC (the nation’s capital); (3) people convicted of crimes within the U.S. military’s criminal justice system; and (4) people convicted in certain foreign transfer treaty cases. People who are on federal parole are supervised by federal probation officers.<sup><a href="#footnote-329" id="footnote-ref-329">[329]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc448152777"></a>What is the difference between the state and federal systems?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Federal and state correctional systems operate separately from each other. The system that convicted you — either federal or state — determines <em>where you</em> will serve time and also <em>what type of supervision</em> you will be on after your release.</p>
  
  <p class="widetableintroitalcaps">Below is a chart that summarizes some key differences between the state and federal systems.</p>

  <h3><a id="_Toc448152778"></a>I’m not sure what type of supervision applies to me. How do I find out?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">You may not know what type of supervision you are under. It’s possible that you could be under more than one type of supervision, or under different types back-to-back. If you don’t know, and <em>you are still incarcerated</em>, you should ask a correctional counselor in your institution. If you don’t know, and <em>you are out</em>, you should ask the case manager or supervising officer you report to.<em> </em></p>
  
  <p>Once you know what type of supervision applies to you, you can skip to the section in this chapter that is relevant to your situation.</p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you are (or will be) on state parole, go to PG. 162.</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you are (or will be) on county probation, or some other county-level supervision (like “mandatory supervision” or “PRCS”), go to PG. 218.</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you are (or will be) on federal probation, go to PG. 236.</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you are (or will be) on federal supervised release, go to PG. 249.</strong></p>
  
  <p class="listparagraph"><strong>If you are (or will be) on federal parole, go to PG. 268.</strong></p>
  
  <h4 class="textbox">A Note About the Terms Used in the Parole &amp; Probation Chapter:</h4>
  
  <p>In this Chapter, when we refer to people returning from the community from prison and jail, we often use official terms and phrases that are used by the California Department of Corrections (CDCR) and other correctional agencies. We don’t always agree with this official language, and we believe it can be dehumanizing; but at times we use it in order to explain the official rules clearly to our readers. Meanwhile, we support efforts to use humanizing language when talking about currently or formerly incarcerated people. To learn more about such efforts, led by formerly incarcerated advocates, visit Root &amp; Rebound’s blog post summarizing an open letter by Eddie Ellis: <a href="https://rootrebound.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/discourse-can-de-humanize-open-letter-on-language-from-cnus/">https://rootrebound.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/discourse-can-de-humanize-open-letter-on-language-from-cnus/</a><strong>.</strong></p>
