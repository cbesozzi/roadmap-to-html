  <p>
    Can I get health care through Covered California while I’m incarcerated?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No. You cannot get health care through Covered California while you are incarcerated, but you may apply for Medi-Cal once you are nearing your release date (more information on Medi-Cal starting on PG. 538). Or if you prefer to have private health care through Covered California, you may apply once you are released (see below for more details).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Helpful HintIf you’re currently serving a sentence in jail or prison, special rules apply to you for applying for health insurance:[1443]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While you’re incarcerated:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You are eligible to enroll in Medi-Cal while incarcerated. You may apply on your own, or through any enrollment program available at your facility.[1444] You can’t start using a Medi-Cal health care plan while you’re incarcerated; but if you enroll before your release, you may be able to get health care more quickly once you’re out.[1445] To learn more about Medi-Cal and how to enroll while incarcerated, go to PG. 538. You are not eligible to buy a private health care plan through Covered California, and the Individual Mandate (see PG. 532) doesn’t apply to you as long as you’re incarcerated following a criminal conviction. This means you don’t have to worry about paying a penalty, or applying for an exemption from the penalty, during your incarceration.[1446]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once you’re released:You may be eligible to enroll in health care through Covered California; and the Individual Mandate (see PG. 532) may now apply to you. This means you may now be legally required to have health care, or pay a tax penalty—unless you get an exemption (read more about exemptions on PG. 532).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you want to enroll in Medi-Cal, and you didn’t already enroll while incarcerated, you can apply at any time after your release. For details about Medi-Cal, go to PG. 538.If you want to buy a private health care plan (and also get tax credits to help pay for it), you have 60 days after your release to notify Covered California, get approved for a Special Enrollment Period (see PG. 534), submit a Covered California application, and enroll in a health care plan. If you don’t complete this process in 60 days, you must wait for the next Open Enrollment period (see PG. 533), and you may have to pay a penalty.[1447]
