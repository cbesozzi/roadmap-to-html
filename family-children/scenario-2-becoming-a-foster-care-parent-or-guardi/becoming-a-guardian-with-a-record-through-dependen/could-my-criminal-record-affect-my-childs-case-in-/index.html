    Could my criminal record affect my child’s case in juvenile delinquency court?

    No. Your criminal record cannot affect your child’s case in juvenile delinquency court.
  </p>
  
  <p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    What juvenile delinquency court is;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What happens when your child is arrested and accused of breaking the law;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The rights you as a parent and your child have when your child is charged with a crime;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The type of hearings you and your child must attend;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The decisions the court can make about your child when your child has been charged with a crime; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    How your child’s records can be sealed.[2395]
  </p>
  
  <p>

  <p>
    What will I learn about adoption?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Understand adoption.The background check process for potential adoptive parents.Whether you can adopt a child if you have a criminal record.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This section is focused on people with criminal records who want to BECOME adoptive parents.
