          <h1>What are the different courts in California that make decisions about family and children?</h1>
          <h3><a id="_Toc312427094"></a><a id="_Toc314389702"></a><a id="_Toc317247490"></a><a id="_Toc448153590"></a>What are the different courts in California that make decisions about family and children?</h3>
          <p class="text">There are 3 different courts in California that make decisions about family matters and the care of children: <span class="emphasisitalic">probate court</span>, <span class="emphasisitalic">juvenile court</span>, and <span class="emphasisitalic">family court</span>.</p>
          <p class="text">It is important to understand the basics of all three courts so you know the best place to go to restore or establish your rights as a parent, grandparent, caregiver, or guardian.</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">Here are the 3 courts and what you need to know:</span></p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">(1) Family court</span> handles cases about <strong>divorce</strong>, <strong>child support</strong>, <strong>paternity/parentage</strong>, and SOME <strong>child custody and visitation</strong> cases.</p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">(2) Probate court</span> handles “probate guardianship” cases. Individuals who want to become a child’s legal guardian, such as relatives or family friends, may file guardianship petitions in this court for temporary or permanent guardianship. This does <em>not</em> end the parent’s rights, but instead puts them on <em>pause.</em></p>
          <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">(3) Juvenile court</span> includes two divisions: <em>dependency</em> and <em>delinquency</em>.</p>
          <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Dependency court</span> handles cases of child abuse and neglect, also called CPS cases. The government agency Child Protective Services (CPS) opens a case in dependency court if someone reports that a child may be at risk. (Note: CPS can have different names in each county of California; it is often called the Department of Child and Family Services). If a child is at risk at home, the dependency court may take over custody of the child. A child is sometimes called a “ward” of the dependency court.</ol>
          <ol class="text">NOTE: <span class="emphasisitalic">Delinquency court</span> makes decisions in cases where a child (under the age of 18) is arrested and charged with a crime. This court may send the young person to juvenile hall as a punishment for breaking the law. For more information on delinquency court, visit the California Courts’ website at <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-delinquency.htm">http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-delinquency.htm</a>. We do not go into detail about delinquency court in this guide because the guide is focused on people in the adult criminal justice system and in reentry from prisons and jails.</ol>
          <div class="textstrongemphasis">If you know which court your family’s or child’s case is in:</div>
          <p class="text">This section gives background on all three courts—<em>probate, family, and dependency</em>. If you already know which court your case (or your child’s case) is in, you can skip directly to the section of this Chapter that discusses that court.</p>
          <div class="textstrongemphasis">If you do NOT know which court your family’s or child’s case is in:</div>
          <p class="text">If you do <em>not</em> know which court your case (or your child’s case) is in, or if it’s in any court at all, read the steps on PG. 897 to learn how to find out which court might be involved. You can also review the chart on the next page (PG. 914 to get a basic idea of what each of the three courts does.</p>

Each court has different rules and procedures. If you’re unsure about which court your case is or should be in, use the chart as a starting point as you work towards reunifying with your children or grandchildren. </p>
