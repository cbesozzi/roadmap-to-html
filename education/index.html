                <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>

                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <h4 class="textbox">What will I learn? </h4>
                <ul class="learn-bullets">A basic overview of your educational optionsWhat you need to get started in pursuing your education</ul>
                <p class="text">Getting an education is one of the most important steps you can take in re-entry if it feels right to you. Education can open doors, create opportunities, and lead to better and more stable employment. This Chapter is a roadmap to help you start (or continue) planning so that you can reach your educational goals. It discusses what programs, schools, and financial aid opportunities are available, and it takes you through the process of deciding what is right for you. The advice here is intended to be practical both for people who are currently incarcerated, as well as for people who were formerly incarcerated and have returned to the community.<em>NOTE FOR READERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED: </em>Throughout this guide, we will often suggest that you “call” the resource that you need. We understand that it might not be possible for you to make these phone calls yourself while you are incarcerated, however we offer it as general information for you, your family, and your advocates to use for your benefit.</p>
                <h4 class="textbox">DID YOU KNOW? </h4>
                <p class="textbox">Studies show that formerly incarcerated people who receive general education or vocational training are much less likely to return to prison and much more likely to find employment after their release. In fact, people who participate in correctional education programs while incarcerated have a 43 percent <em>lower</em> chance of returning to prison, and a 13 percent <em>higher</em> chance of finding employment, than people who do not do educational programs while incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2544" id="footnote-ref-2544">[2544]</a></sup> </p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153730"></a>Questions to start with</h1>
                <p class="text">Thinking through the following questions will help you set your educational goals and decide which path is best for you. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153731"></a>What are my educational options?</h3>
                <p class="text">Your decision about which school or program you enroll in will depend on many factors: your personal and career goals, your finances, your educational background and current skills, and your ability to overcome any barriers that may arise because of your criminal history. Your decision may also depend on day-to-day needs—such as your health, family responsibilities, access to transportation, and parole or probation conditions.  To start, here is an overview of the educational options this Chapter will cover:</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes</span> (PG. 951) improve your basic math, reading, writing, and life skills; and these classes can help you get ready for high school-level work.<span class="emphasisitalic">High school credentials (diploma or GED)</span> (PG. 953) are a minimum requirement for many jobs, and are a necessary step before you can continue your education through a Career Technical Education program or a college or university degree. You can earn a high school credential by completing a high school diploma program or passing the GED test.<span class="emphasisitalic">Career Technical Education (CTE) programs</span> (PG. 961) train you for specific kinds of jobs, and sometimes lead to certificates or professional/occupational licenses that you need for those jobs. Different programs take different lengths of time, but they’re often designed so that you can complete them in 1 year.<span class="emphasisitalic">College Degree: </span>Two-year and four-year colleges and universities award college degrees (also called academic degrees) for completing a program of academic study. College degree programs usually do not train you for a specific type of job, but give you a wide variety of general skills that are useful for many different professions. The different types of college (academic) degrees are: associate, and bachelor’s.<span class="emphasisitalic">Two-year college (associate degree) programs</span> (PG. 966) allow you to earn an associate degree, which can be a stepping-stone to entry-level jobs or to a four-year college program. Note: Part-time students will take longer than 2 years.<span class="emphasisitalic">Four-year college and university programs</span> (PG. 965) allow you to earn a bachelor’s degree, which can be a stepping-stone to higher-level jobs or to graduate or professional school. Note: Part-time students will take longer than 4 years.<span class="emphasisitalic">Graduate or professional schools</span> allow you to earn advanced degrees after you’ve earned a bachelor’s degree. Earning a professional degree allows you to become licensed to work in professions like law or medicine; the kinds of jobs it can lead to depends on your field of study.<sup><a href="#footnote-2545" id="footnote-ref-2545">[2545]</a></sup> Earning a master’s degree generally takes 2 years, and a doctorate degree can take 3 years or more.</ol>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153732"></a>What educational options do I have while I’m on probation or parole?</h3>
                <p class="text"><em>It depends. </em>Once you are released, you will have access to free resources available in the community—including the Internet, public libraries, and community service organizations—that can help you do research, apply to schools and programs, and get financial assistance (“financial aid”) to help pay for your education. You may also become eligible (qualify) for more types of financial aid once you are released, which can allow you to consider schools or programs that you otherwise might not be able to afford.<em>However, </em>the educational options available to you will ultimately depend on the community you live in (urban areas tend to have more opportunities), your life circumstances (such as family responsibilities), and any probation or parole conditions that might affect your access to educational programs and services (such as travel restrictions). </p>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your parole agent or probation officer should be supportive and encourage you to pursue your educational goals as part of your successful reintegration.<sup><a href="#footnote-2546" id="footnote-ref-2546">[2546]</a></sup> If you find that s/he is not supportive, or that your parole/probation conditions make it difficult or impossible for you to get an education, there are steps you can take! </p>

                <p class="text">You have options, but unfortunately your options and the quality of the programs will depend on where you’re incarcerated. The programs and resources available to you will be different based on whether you’re incarcerated in a federal prison, state prison, or county jail. In addition, the availability of programs and resources will be different across different facilities.<sup><a href="#footnote-2548" id="footnote-ref-2548">[2548]</a></sup> In general, the following programs will be available to you:</p>
                <ol class="text">If you’re in a federal prison, you should have free access to assessment testing, ABE classes (including literacy and ESL), GED programs,<sup><a href="#footnote-2549" id="footnote-ref-2549">[2549]</a></sup> CTE and job readiness programs,<sup><a href="#footnote-2550" id="footnote-ref-2550">[2550]</a></sup> as well as a College Coordinator who can help you enroll in and complete correspondence (mail) courses.<sup><a href="#footnote-2551" id="footnote-ref-2551">[2551]</a></sup>If you’re in a California state prison, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provides free access to assessment testing, ABE classes (including literacy and ESL), GED programs, high school diploma programs, CTE and job readiness programs, occupational licensing, library services, and tutoring support programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2552" id="footnote-ref-2552">[2552]</a></sup> If you’re incarcerated in a California county jail, California law gives individuals counties permission (and resources) to establish education programs in all adult county correctional facilities and to award diplomas and certificates for completion of study in these programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2553" id="footnote-ref-2553">[2553]</a></sup> However, the law does not require that the counties do so, or control how those programs are to be structured. Therefore, the availability and quality of educational programs varies from county to county.<sup><a href="#footnote-2554" id="footnote-ref-2554">[2554]</a></sup> If you are incarcerated in county jail, you will need to check with your facility to see what educational programs are available to you.</ol>
                <p class="textbox">For details about the different programs that might be available while you are incarcerated, read the section on Learning the Educational Landscape, starting on PG. 951. Even if you don’t have access to programs or classes that are right for you while you’re incarcerated, there are programs you can complete on your own through correspondence courses or self-study. There are also practical steps you can take while incarcerated to prepare for your education after release.</p>
                <p class="text">For information about correspondence and self-study courses, see PG. 977. For information on preparing for your post-release education while you are still incarcerated, see PG. 943.</p>

                <p class="text">The process of pursuing your education—not to mention the larger process of transitioning back into your community—can be rewarding, but also challenging and stressful at times. You’ll be dealing with a lot of forms, applications, and procedures and this may feel overwhelming. Here are some tips for staying on track throughout this process: </p>
                <ol class="text">Gather and organize all the documents you will need for applying to schools and programs, financial aid, and employment (see list of documents below PG. 932). Keep all your important documents together, and use a large envelope or folder to store them. Keeping these papers clean, safe, and organized will save you lots of time and frustration.<sup><a href="#footnote-2555" id="footnote-ref-2555">[2555]</a></sup> Getting some of these documents may require lots of paperwork, a long application process, or lots of follow-up efforts, so if you are able to gather these documents as soon as possible, take advantage of this and gather them to save you time. (For details about these documents—what they are and how to get them—see the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 21.) Take the time to make informed decisions. Before committing to any school or program, get as much information as possible and consider your options carefully. Do background research at the library or on the Internet, ask questions to people who have been through the program or know of its reputation, beware of scams and bogus credentials, and investigate ways to save time and money. Ask for help! Get advice from the people who are there to help you. If you are currently incarcerated, talk to the education staff, counselors, and program directors at your facility. Ask friends and family members to do research and gather information for you. If you’re in the community, visit your local public library and look for reentry programs, social service organizations, career centers, and community colleges in your area.</ol>

                <p class="text">In general, these are the documents you’ll need to have ready as you apply for schools, programs, and financial aid.

                <p class="text">Your immunization record (also called your vaccination record) is a list of all the vaccines (medicines) you received as a child and as an adult that prevent common diseases like polio, chicken pox and tuberculosis.

                <p class="text">Unfortunately, there is no national database of immunization/vaccination records. The only records that exist are the documents you or your parents were given when you were vaccinated, and the medical records kept by the doctor or clinic where you were vaccinated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2558" id="footnote-ref-2558">[2558]</a></sup>If you need official copies of your immunization/vaccination records, there are several places you can look:<sup><a href="#footnote-2559" id="footnote-ref-2559">[2559]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">Ask a parent or guardian if they kept the records of your childhood immunizations/vaccinations;Check with your elementary school, high school and/or college for records of any immunizations (generally, records are kept only for 1-2 years after students leave the school system); Check with your correctional facility’s health care services department to see if it has kept records of your immunizations/vaccinations;Check with previous employers (including the military) that may have required immunizations/vaccinations; Check with your doctor (immunization/vaccination records are maintained at doctors’ offices for a limited number of years); Contact your state’s health department. Some states have registries that include adult immunizations/vaccinations. </ol>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">NOTE</span>: California does have a registry, but it is relatively new (within the last 10 years only), and it is not used by all doctors’ offices. For more information, visit: </p>

                <p class="text">If you can’t find your immunization/vaccination records, you may need to get vaccinated again. While this is not ideal, it is safe to repeat vaccines. Your doctor may also be able to do blood tests to see if you are already immune to certain diseases, so you do not have to repeat those vaccinations.<sup><a href="#footnote-2560" id="footnote-ref-2560">[2560]</a></sup></p>

                <p class="text">Setting your educational goals involves asking yourself some important questions about your future. What purpose do you want your education to serve? Is it a way to achieve a specific goal – for example, a way to get a better job? Is it an opportunity for personal growth? Or both?Going through some of the questions below may make it easier to make a decision and help you get a clear idea of the goals you want to reach. Often there are several answers to a question, so making lists can help you organize your thoughts and priorities.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153740"></a>Some questions for you to think about on your personal educational journey</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153741"></a>What are your short-term and long-term educational goals?</h3>
                <p class="text"><em>What are your immediate educational needs? </em>Your immediate needs may affect which avenue of education you choose to take:</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153742"></a>What practical considerations do you need to take into account?</h3>
                <p class="text">Outside factors and life circumstances can have a huge impact on your educational goals. As an adult student, you may have work and family obligations to juggle. If you’re incarcerated or on parole/probation, you may have to work around special restrictions in order to pursue your education. In light of all this, you’ll want to pick an education program that you can balance with your other responsibilities, and that fits your current situation as well as your future goals. For example, you may ask yourself: </p>
                <ol class="text">How much time do you have to devote to your education? Do you have a family to support and take care of? Will you need to work to support yourself while in school? Are your options limited because you are still incarcerated or on parole or probation? See PG. 940 </ol>

                <p class="text">Once you have a list of potential jobs and careers that you are interested in, you will need to start narrowing it down. You should start by considering your lifestyle and identifying any factors or circumstances that might conflict with a job you are interested in. For example, criminal convictions, family responsibilities, and travel or mobility restrictions can affect whether a particular job or career is a good fit for you.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153747"></a>Does the job or career you are interested in have restrictions against people with criminal records?</h3>
                <p class="text">Some jobs or career fields are prohibited or have limited opportunities for people with certain criminal convictions—called legal job restrictions. Additionally, many jobs in California require you to get a professional/ occupational license in order to work in this job, and many licensing boards have restrictions about issuing licenses to people with certain convictions (see next question for more information). So even though this information can be difficult and frustrating to learn, it will help you to design the best path for yourself—one that you are passionate about but that is also realistic. Given the laws and barriers in place regarding certain professions and license, this information may be useful to consider when making decisions regarding your educational path.

These professional/occupational licenses are issued and regulated by over 40 different licensing boards under the control of the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2571" id="footnote-ref-2571">[2571]</a></sup></sup>Applying for a professional/occupational license generally requires submitting your fingerprints, paying various application fees, and proving that you meet certain educational and/or work experience requirements, which are set by the particular licensing board that you’re applying to.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2572" id="footnote-ref-2572">[2572]</a></sup></sup></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153753"></a>If I am still incarcerated. what barriers might I face in pursuing my education?</h3>
                <p class="text">Thankfully, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), and the California Department of Education (California DOE) have all recognized that providing educational opportunities to people who are incarcerated is critical to rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.<sup><a href="#footnote-2582" id="footnote-ref-2582">[2582]</a></sup> However, the systems are far from perfect, and it is important for you to be aware of the obstacles you may face when you are pursuing an education while incarcerated. Be patient! There is almost always a way to make it work if you are dedicated to reaching your educational goals. Here are some of the common issues that you might face when pursuing your education while you are still incarcerated, followed by suggestions that can help you achieve your goals in spite of the challenges:</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">The programs I need are just not available.</div>
                <p class="text">The quality and availability of programs for different educational needs varies greatly from facility to facility. Additionally, even if your facility offers the program you want, there are often long waitlists to get enrolled. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion</span>: Try supplementing your coursework with a correspondence course or related self-study. If you are waiting to get into a class, find out what the students are learning about—maybe you can get a head start!</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">The prison mail system is getting in the way.</div>
                <p class="text">If you decide to pursue your education through a correspondence course, or if you want to create your own self-study program, you may find that the prison mail system is frustrating your efforts. Materials and assignments may be slow in getting to you, and some items may not get to you at all because they are not allowed by your facility. All of this could mean significant delays in your studies or prevent you from completing them at all. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Be patient. There is no time limit on most correspondence courses—you can take as long as you need to complete the coursework. The goal is to learn the materials and pass the class, no matter how long it takes. Slow progress is still progress! If you find that your facility is overly restrictive in what materials it will allow in, try writing to the correspondence course administrator to explain your situation. See if he or she can put the materials into a format that your facility will be less likely to object to. (For a list of schools with a history of successfully offering correspondence courses to incarcerated people, see Appendix D, PG. 1001.) </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t afford the cost of programs and/or materials.</div>
                <p class="text">For any program or course that is not offered by the facility directly, you will be responsible for the cost of any necessary books, materials, or course fees. If you cannot afford these expenses, you may be prevented from participating in the program or taking the course. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Try to find someone else at your facility who is taking or has taken the course. See if that person is willing to share materials with you or donate them to you when he or she is done. Look into financial aid options to help with your costs. Some forms of financial aid are available while you are incarcerated, and there are even special scholarships to help incarcerated people afford textbooks and materials. (See <em>Paying for Your Education</em>, PG. 980 for more information about these programs.) </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I have limited access to technologies.</div>
                <p class="text">Distance Education courses commonly require that you have access to certain technologies (audio/video equipment, computers, the Internet) in order to participate in the program (except for traditional mail-only correspondence courses). If you don’t have a way to use the media that contains the course content, you won’t be able to take the course. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span><em> </em>Shop around for a course that doesn’t require the use of equipment that you don’t have. Try signing up for a program or activity in your facility that will give you access to the technology you need and will allow you to use it in your spare time (make sure you are authorized to do so!). </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I am not eligible for financial aid.</div>
                <p class="text">Certain types of financial aid are not available to you while you are incarcerated, and other types are not available if you have certain types of convictions.<span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Apply for the types of financial aid that are available to you while you are incarcerated. Plus, while you are incarcerated, you can apply for financial aid that you will become eligible for once you are released, so the money will be ready for you when you get out. (For more information about financial aid, see <em>Paying for your Education</em>, PG. 980.)</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153754"></a>If I am under federal, state, or county supervision, what barriers might I face?</h3>
                <p class="text">While you are under supervision, your parole or probation officer should fully support your efforts to pursue your education.<sup><a href="#footnote-2583" id="footnote-ref-2583">[2583]</a></sup> However, sometimes even the normal conditions of supervision can get in the way, and make it difficult for you to reach your educational goals. Fortunately, there are ways to work around your restrictions and steps you can take to stay on track even while they are in place. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you find that your parole or probation officer is not supportive of your efforts to get an education, or that the conditions of your supervision are so restrictive that they make it impossible for you to pursue your education, this might be a violation of your rights. You should contact an attorney who can advise you and look into getting your restrictive conditions lifted. (For more information, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 130.)</p>
                <p class="text">Here are some of the common barriers that you might face when trying to pursue your education while you are under supervision, followed by suggestions that can help you achieve your goals in spite of the challenges:</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t get to school because I have travel limitations.</div>
                <p class="text">While you are on supervision you may have restrictions on how far you can travel, or you may not have reliable transportation, or you may have to rely on public transportation. All of these factors may limit where you can go to school. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Look into local schools and programs that are easily accessible for you and do not involve a long commute. You can also explore Distance Education and correspondence course options. You may even be able to use the computers at your local public library to take these courses. (For information on Distance Education see PG. 974 or for correspondence courses, see PG. 977. For information on resources at your local public library, see PG. 930.) </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t go to the school I want because I can’t move out of the area.</div>
                <p class="text">Similar to travel restrictions, while you are under supervision, you probably will not be allowed to move outside of the county or the state. If the school you want to go to is in another county or state, you may not be able to attend it. <span class="emphasisitalic">Suggestion:</span> Again, local schools and programs are your best bet. If you are located in a rural area where your options are severely limited, get started earning credits through Distance Education and correspondence courses. Once you’ve completed your term of supervision, you can transfer to the school you want to attend and bring your earned credits with you. (For information on Distance Education see PG. 974 or for correspondence courses, see PG. 977. For information on transferring credits, see PG. 974.) </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I can’t fit school into my schedule because of restrictions on my time (“passes,” curfews, work requirements).</div>
                <p class="text">While you are under supervision, you may be restricted in the amount of time you can spend attending classes, or by the hours of the day that you are allowed to be away from home to attend. You may have a curfew imposed on you or you may be required to get a “pass” that is only good for a short period of time in order to leave your residence. You may also be required to work a certain number of hours a day, which leaves little time for school.<span class="emphasisitalic">Solution:</span> If you only have a limited amount of time to attend school each day, consider starting part time instead of full time. Take a class or two, and then build your schedule up when you are able. Also, Distance Education programs and correspondence courses are more flexible and can generally be worked around any schedule.</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">I am required to register as a sex offender.</div>
                <p class="text">If you are required to register as a sex offender, you should still be able to attend the school or program of your choice, but you will need to comply with sex-offender residency restrictions. This means that you cannot live in on-campus housing, and you must live at least 2000 yards from the school campus.<sup><a href="#footnote-2584" id="footnote-ref-2584">[2584]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153755"></a>If I have completed my sentence, and I’m off supervision, what barriers might I still face?</h3>
                <p class="text">Once you have completed your sentence, including any term of supervision, most of the barriers that we have discussed so far will no longer exist for you. Unfortunately, your criminal record may still inhibit or interfere with your educational plans. See PG. 945</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153756"></a><a id="ED_choosingeducationalpath"></a>How to choose the educational path that meets your specific educational goals</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153757"></a>Once everything is considered, how do I start finding the educational program that is right for me?</h3>
                <p class="text">Whatever education level you are currently at and whatever your future education plans are, the general steps you should follow when deciding on a program are the same. Use these steps to help guide you through your decision-making process. Along the way, you can talk to people around you who can help. Your Correctional Counselor, the staff in the Education Department, a school or career center counselor, and family and friends can provide advice and support throughout this process. </p>
                <h4 class="step">FIND PROGRAMS THAT FIT YOUR NEEDS</h4>
                <p class="text">Obviously, you want to find a program that meets the interests that you identified in the very beginning of this chapter (see “Setting Your Educational Goals,” PG. 935), but in order to find a program that truly fits your needs, must consider the practical factors that will impact your educational experience. You should think through the following questions to help you guide your decision:</p>
                <h4 class="sidebox">Larger Schools v. Smaller Schools</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Larger schools tend to have more diverse student populations, and a greater variety of extra-curricular activities and clubs. However, you may feel distracted and overwhelmed in this environment, and class size is larger which means less individual attention from the teacher. </p>
                <ol class="text">Do you want to study full or part-time? Is it more important for you to finish the program quickly or do you need to split your class time with other responsibilities? Would you prefer to go to a large school or a smaller school? Do you need to be in a classroom at all, or is distance learning a better option for you? Do you want to go to a public (state-funded) or private (privately owned) school? </ol>
                <h4 class="step">RESEARCH SCHOOL/PROGRAM QUALITY</h4>
                <p class="text">Evaluate the quality of each school or program by following these steps:<sup><a href="#footnote-2585" id="footnote-ref-2585">[2585]</a></sup> </p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Check for “accreditation” and other approval</span>.Find out if the school or program is accredited. Accredited schools have been reviewed by an accrediting organization recognized by the U.S. Dep’t of Educ. (USDE) and meet established USDE requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-2586" id="footnote-ref-2586">[2586]</a></sup> If working in the field requires a license and certification, find out if the school or program is approved by the proper state licensing agency and the professional organization that grants certifications.<sup><a href="#footnote-2587" id="footnote-ref-2587">[2587]</a></sup> Search for a school in the Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions &amp; Programs (<a href="http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation">www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation</a>). If a school is accredited, it will show up in the database <span class="emphasisitalic">Find data on how well the school’s graduates are doing.</span><em> </em>Find out if the school has a Gainful Employment Disclosure, which should provide information about overall costs for students, average debt, graduation and job placement rates, and which occupations students are prepared for..<sup><a href="#footnote-2588" id="footnote-ref-2588">[2588]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Talk to people in the school or program.</span><em> </em>Ask current students, alumni (former students), and teachers how well the school or program prepares students for their field, and whether it helps students find jobs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2589" id="footnote-ref-2589">[2589]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Ask employers what they think of the program.</span> Find employers in the field that you would want to work for and ask them to rate the program. <span class="emphasisitalic">WARNING: BE CAREFUL OF SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS THAT ARE SCAMS:</span>Beware of for-profit schools that are out to take your money -- not to give you a quality education. These schools spend lots of money on recruiting, and little on teaching or career services for students. They also tend to charge higher tuition than public community colleges and are likely to leave you with high debt, poor training, and slim chances of finding a job. Following the research steps above will help you avoid these schools.<sup><a href="#footnote-2590" id="footnote-ref-2590">[2590]</a></sup>Similarly, beware of “schools” or “programs” that aren’t real schools or programs, but instead are diploma mills — companies selling diplomas. These companies promise to give you a certificate, diploma, or degree for very little work in a very short time. The credentials they offer have little or no value in the job market.<sup><a href="#footnote-2591" id="footnote-ref-2591">[2591]</a></sup>Here are some warning signs that a “school” or “program” may be a scam or a diploma mill:It is not accredited, or it is accredited by an agency that is not nationally recognized;It requires little or no academic work, and involves minimal interaction with teachers;It allows you to earn a certificate in an unusually short period of time; It requires that you pay a flat fee for the credential; Its mailing address is a post office box or suite number;Its website ends in “.com” instead of “.edu”.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2592" id="footnote-ref-2592">[2592]</a></sup></sup></ol>
                <h4>Why accreditation is important:</h4>
                <ol class="text">Employers generally respect credentials from an accredited institution with a good reputation, and view job-seekers with such credentials more favorably. Credits from a non-accredited school, generally cannot be transferred to an accredited school.You must attend an accredited school to be eligible for government financial aid.</ol>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153758"></a><a id="ED_howcriminalrecordaffectsadmission"></a>Can I be denied acceptance to an educational program or institution because of my criminal history?</h3>
                <p class="text">Sadly, yes<em>.</em> Over the last decade, more and more colleges and universities across the country have begun to look into applicants’ criminal histories as part of the admissions process.<sup><a href="#footnote-2594" id="footnote-ref-2594">[2594]</a></sup> In a recent study, two-thirds of the responding institutions reported collecting criminal history information on prospective students.<sup><a href="#footnote-2595" id="footnote-ref-2595">[2595]</a></sup> Most commonly, institutions ask applicants to self-report their criminal history (answer “yes” and then explain). Some schools do conduct full criminal background checks on prospective students and then use the information to deny admission to people with criminal records, or give them conditional admission with added requirements and restrictions—kind of like “admission on probation.”<sup><a href="#footnote-2596" id="footnote-ref-2596">[2596]</a></sup> Unfortunately, there is nothing illegal about what they’re doing, and no real legal way to stop them from doing it. The best defense, however, is a good offense—in other words, be proactive! Take steps to clean up your criminal record, participate in rehabilitation programs, and be prepared with answers to questions about your criminal history. (See the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029 for information and details on how to “clean up” your record.)<span class="emphasisitalic">The Good News…</span>Many colleges and universities will let you appeal a denial based on your criminal record, and will work with you to help you get in. Reach out to the Admissions Office staff and to school advisors to show them that you are serious and dedicated to your future. Take advantage of any opportunity to show that your criminal history is just that—history. You can use your personal essay (part of your application), in–person interview, letters of recommendation, and any other supporting documents to show the admissions committee that you are more than just your record.<sup><a href="#footnote-2597" id="footnote-ref-2597">[2597]</a></sup> Here are some other facts to keep in mind that work in your favor:</p>
                <ol class="text">There are no educational opportunities that you are legally banned from because of your criminal record—no matter what is in it;California public community colleges, state colleges, and state universities do not ask prospective students about their criminal history (as a policy);<sup><a href="#footnote-2598" id="footnote-ref-2598">[2598]</a></sup>Educational institutions are not authorized under California law to request background checks on people,<sup><a href="#footnote-2599" id="footnote-ref-2599">[2599]</a></sup> (however, there is nothing to stop them from asking self-reporting questions on applications). Distance Education programs are not likely to ask about your criminal history because they do not have to worry about campus safety (Although there is no evidence that a student with a criminal history poses an increased safety risk,<sup><a href="#footnote-2600" id="footnote-ref-2600">[2600]</a></sup> this is the main reason schools care about your criminal history). Many schools will look at your criminal history only to flag you if you are applying to a program in a career field that you’re not allowed to work in anyway because of your criminal history (common in medical schools).<sup><a href="#footnote-2601" id="footnote-ref-2601">[2601]</a></sup> (For more information on licensing and employment restrictions, see EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, PG. 654.)Some colleges collect criminal history information, but never actually use it.<sup><a href="#footnote-2602" id="footnote-ref-2602">[2602]</a></sup> </ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153759"></a>Do I need to disclose my juvenile record when applying to different educational programs?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. Technically, a juvenile “adjudication” is not a criminal conviction. If your case was heard in a juvenile court, and you received a juvenile adjudication, then you were not “convicted” of a crime. So, if the application asks if you were “convicted of a crime” or if you have any “criminal convictions,” and you only have a juvenile adjudication, you can truthfully answer “no.” You do not have to disclose your juvenile adjudication.<sup><a href="#footnote-2603" id="footnote-ref-2603">[2603]</a></sup> However, some applications ask if you have ever been “arrested” or “adjudicated guilty,”<sup><a href="#footnote-2604" id="footnote-ref-2604">[2604]</a></sup> in which case, your juvenile arrest and adjudication count, and need to be reported. <em>Remember</em>, if you were tried as an adult, even if you were under 18, and you pleaded or were found guilty, then you do have a criminal conviction. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Even if you are not directly asked to disclose your juvenile record on an application, you may want to anyway. There is always a chance that the admissions committee will find out about a juvenile arrest or adjudication somehow, and think you were being dishonest in not reporting it.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2605" id="footnote-ref-2605">[2605]</a></sup></strong> HOWEVER,<span class="emphasisheavy"> </span>when you get your juvenile record sealed in California, <em>it’s as if it never existed</em>.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2606" id="footnote-ref-2606">[2606]</a></sup></strong> So, if you got your juvenile record sealed, you do not need to disclose anything in it.

                <p class="text">The easiest way to assess your education level is to take an assessment test (also called a placement test). There are two assessment tests that are often used for adults who wish to continue their education: the TABE and the CASAS.<sup><a href="#footnote-2607" id="footnote-ref-2607">[2607]</a></sup>Don’t worry, these are not the kind of tests you need to study for! These tests measure what academic skills you’re already good at and which ones you need to work on. They help you determine what classes will be the right fit for your current education level.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153765"></a>What does it mean to have a learning challenge or special need?</h3>
                <p class="text">Each of us learns in our own way and at our own speed. However, for many people, their brains have particular trouble receiving, storing, processing, retrieving, or communicating information.<sup><a href="#footnote-2615" id="footnote-ref-2615">[2615]</a></sup> The brain’s trouble with these things is called a learning challenge (often called a “learning disability”). Unfortunately, many people have struggled in school their whole lives, but do not realize that their difficulties stem from learning challenges that can be overcome. Many people with learning challenges are able to prosper in school if they get the proper guidance, support, and instruction. The most common learning challenges are: </p>
                <ol class="text">Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—inability to control behavior or pay attention, often accompanied by hyperactivity.Dyslexia—difficulty reading, understanding, and processing written words.Dyscalculia—difficulty with number values, calculations, and math concepts.</ol>
                <p class="text">There are many other types of learning challenges, including those related to writing, processing visual or sound information, memory, organization, and attention to detail. If certain subjects—or school in general—always seemed difficult for you, you may suffer from a learning challenge that was not discovered. For more information about learning challenges, visit the Learning Disabilities Association of America at <a href="http://ldaamerica.org/adult-learning-disability-assessment-process/">http://ldaamerica.org/adult-learning-disability-assessment-process/</a>, or the National Association for Adults with Learning Disabilities at <a href="http://naasln.org/">http://naasln.org/</a>. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153766"></a>How do I find out if I have a learning challenge?</h3>
                <p class="text">If you think you may have a learning challenge, the first step is to get a professional assessment. A qualified professional can determine the source of your difficulty, and work with you to figure out what special learning tools may help you overcome it. Additionally, if you are diagnosed with a learning disability, schools and programs are required by law to give you special treatment to allow for your special learning needs. This is called giving you an “accommodation.” Accommodations can include: </p>
                <ol class="text">Giving you extra time to take tests;Letting you use a calculator; OR Providing you with reading or writing assistance.<sup><a href="#footnote-2616" id="footnote-ref-2616">[2616]</a></sup> </ol>

You should then have access to ABE classes. (In federal facilities, ABE is part of a broader program called Adult Continuing Education or ACE). If your assessment shows that you’re not fluent in English, you must be enrolled in ESL, and if you don’t have a high school degree, you must be enrolled in classes designed to lead to a GED or high school diploma.<sup><a href="#footnote-2627" id="footnote-ref-2627">[2627]</a></sup> If you’re not enrolled in these classes for some reason, but you want to be, ask your education advisor about getting placed into these classes.<sup><a href="#footnote-2628" id="footnote-ref-2628">[2628]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">In a California state prison</span>: To enroll in any education program, you must have a TABE score on file.

                <p class="sidebox">A GED is a high school proficiency test, which may allow you to earn a high school equivalency certificate in a more expedited manner or at your own pace. The test requires you to pass 4 parts in different subjects matters at your own pace. However, An adult high school diploma requires more coursework prior to obtaining your diploma. An Adult High School Diploma requires certain coursework to be completed at your own pace. After all the coursework is completed, you will be required to pass an exit exam called California High School Exit Examination. It is important to note that if you have already completed many high school courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, a high school diploma program may be a faster route than a GED.</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153779"></a>How do I prepare for the GED test?</h3>
                <p class="text"><strong>FIRST:</strong> Learn as much as you can about the GED test. You should know: What subjects and skills does the test cover? How long does the test take? What do the questions look like? You can get information by contacting the GED Testing Service (see PG. 957 for contact information), by asking teachers or tutors in a GED program, and by looking at GED practice tests and study materials (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials). Here is some general information to start with:</p>
                <ol class="text">The GED test has 4 modules (subject-matter tests): language arts, math, social studies, and science. You can take all 4 modules on the same day, which takes 7+ hours; or you can schedule them for separate dates.<sup><a href="#footnote-2651" id="footnote-ref-2651">[2651]</a></sup> As of January 1, 2014, the GED test is computer-based; but if you’re in a prison or jail that doesn’t have computers set up, you might be taking the test with a pencil and paper.<sup><a href="#footnote-2652" id="footnote-ref-2652">[2652]</a></sup> To find out which version of the test you’ll take, ask your facility’s education department staff. </ol>
                <p class="text"><strong>SECOND:</strong> Learn as much as possible about your readiness for the test. You should know:</p>
                <ol class="text">Which subjects or skills do you feel confident about, and which ones should you focus on improving? How comfortable do you feel with the test format? Do you need to practice answering test questions more quickly? What study methods are best for your current skills and learning style? You can get a sense of how ready you are by taking practice GED tests on your own, and/or by working with teachers or tutors in a GED program who can give you feedback about your skills (see below for tips on finding GED programs and study materials, including practice tests). </ol>
                <p class="text"><strong>THIRD:</strong> Make use of teaching, tutoring, and study materials that are available to you. Below is general information about potential resources that you may be able to use:</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re currently incarcerated:</div>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">In a federal prison</span>: When you get to your federal facility, staff will review your county jail assessment information. If you don’t have a high school degree, you will be enrolled in classes designed to lead up to a GED or a high school diploma (unless they decide that you must take Adult Basic Education classes first).<sup><a href="#footnote-2653" id="footnote-ref-2653">[2653]</a></sup> Ask your education advisor if you have questions about enrollment. <span class="emphasisitalic">In a California state prison</span>: If you don’t have a high school credential, you can enroll in GED classes if your TABE scores qualify you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2654" id="footnote-ref-2654">[2654]</a></sup> You may also be able to get extra tutoring support through the Voluntary Education Program (VEP).<sup><a href="#footnote-2655" id="footnote-ref-2655">[2655]</a></sup> Ask your correctional counselor or education department staff about enrolling in GED classes or VEP. (Remember, before you enroll in GED or VEP, you must have a TABE score on file.<sup><a href="#footnote-2656" id="footnote-ref-2656">[2656]</a></sup> See PG. 947 for information about the TABE and getting an educational assessment). <span class="emphasisitalic">In a California county jail</span>: If your educational assessment scores qualify you for GED courses, your facility should enroll you if they offer these courses.<sup><a href="#footnote-2657" id="footnote-ref-2657">[2657]</a></sup> If not, you can contact community service organizations to request materials. See Appendix B, PG. 992 for a list or organizations that provide GED materials. </ol>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you are in county jail awaiting transfer to a federal or state facility, you will NOT be allowed to take anything with you, including any books or other materials related to your educational programming, when you are transferred. You will need to gather all of your materials ahead of time and mail them to someone on the outside before you are transferred. That person can then mail your materials back to you at your new facility.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2658" id="footnote-ref-2658">[2658]</a></sup></strong></p>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Even though most facilities in California at the federal, state, and county level offer GED classes, often there are long waiting lists to get in, or they are offered in “cycles” (which means that if you miss the beginning of the cycle, you cannot enroll until the next one). If you cannot enroll in a GED class for any reason, you should try to begin studying on your own. Check your facility’s library for GED “prep” books and materials. These resources will walk you through lesson plans, and usually contain sample questions and practice tests.<sup><a href="#footnote-2659" id="footnote-ref-2659">[2659]</a></sup> They can also be ordered through most book distributors. Check with your facility for a list of book distributors that are approved to send materials to inmates. There are also a number of community adult literacy programs and other service organizations that will send books and materials to incarcerated people for free. You can contact these organizations to request the study materials you need. For a list of organizations that provide books and materials to incarcerated people, visit Urbana Campaign to Prisoners at <a href="http://www.books2prisoners.org/partnerships.php">http://www.books2prisoners.org/partnerships.php</a> or see Appendix B, PG. 992. </p>

                <p class="textbox">If you are preparing for a GED test while incarcerated and find out that you will be released before you finish your class or program, ask your GED teacher for a “progress report.” This report will show exactly where you are in the process, so that you can pick up your studies in the same place after your release.<sup><a href="#footnote-2660" id="footnote-ref-2660">[2660]</a></sup> </p>

                <h2 class="subheading2">Adult High School Diploma Programs </h2>
                <h4 class="sidebox">GED vs. High school diploma</h4>
                <p class="sidebox">Compared to a GED program, which may focus on preparing you to answer test questions quickly, a high school diploma program requires you to complete many classes that are part of a high school education. Required course subjects include: English (reading, writing, literature); math (algebra, geometry); natural science (biology, ecology, physics); social science (history, civics, economics); humanities (art, religion); and electives (health, media literacy).</p>
                <p class="text">This section will help you decide whether an adult high school diploma program is a good option for you. You’ll also learn how to locate and sign up for an adult high school diploma program that meets your needs. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153782"></a>What is an adult high school diploma program? How can it help me?</h3>
                <p class="text">These diploma programs are for adults who didn’t finish high school, and who want to complete the courses normally required for high school graduation (instead of taking a GED or high school equivalency test).<sup><a href="#footnote-2674" id="footnote-ref-2674">[2674]</a></sup> High school diploma programs are offered in most jails and prisons, and in adult schools and community colleges throughout California.<sup><a href="#footnote-2675" id="footnote-ref-2675">[2675]</a></sup> In most adult high school diploma programs, you can choose to enroll in traditional classes, or to complete courses at your own pace through individual study and regular check-ins with teachers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2676" id="footnote-ref-2676">[2676]</a></sup> In addition, some programs also allow you to complete correspondence courses through mail or email with teachers (for details on distance learning, see PG. 974; for correspondence programs, see PG. 977). After completing all of the required courses, you will have to pass an “exit” exam, called the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) to receive your high school diploma.<sup><a href="#footnote-2677" id="footnote-ref-2677">[2677]</a></sup> All students in California public schools must pass the CAHSEE before they are awarded a high school diploma. This includes people who earn their diploma while incarcerated. </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153783"></a>How much time will it take to earn my high school diploma?</h3>
                <p class="text">It depends. Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, life circumstances, and learning preferences. Depending on the program you enroll in, you might work toward your diploma individually, at your own pace; or you might work with a teacher who creates assignment deadlines and a long-term schedule for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2678" id="footnote-ref-2678">[2678]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4 class="textbox">GENERAL TIPS</h4>
                <p class="textbox">If you’ve already completed many of the courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, an adult high school diploma program is likely a faster route for you than the GED.If you haven’t completed many high school courses, the GED will probably be a faster path to your high school equivalency certificate.<span class="emphasisitalic">But consider</span>, if you have not taken many high school courses yet, and you have some time to spend on your high school education, you might prefer a diploma program because it can be an opportunity to explore new subjects and skills that you won’t learn in a GED program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2679" id="footnote-ref-2679">[2679]</a></sup></p>

                <ul class="textbox"><strong>TIP 1</strong>: Many community colleges offer dual enrollment programs or continuing education programs, which allow you to earn an adult high school diploma or equivalency certificate AND get started on earning college credits at the same time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2689" id="footnote-ref-2689">[2689]</a></sup> <strong>TIP 2</strong>: If you have meaningful school, work, or life experience, find out if you can make it count toward your diploma. Some adult schools or programs might give you credit for past high school work, job training, work experience, community service, military service, or self-study. Ask the individual school or program if it will do this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2690" id="footnote-ref-2690">[2690]</a></sup></ul>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="Educ_HigherEducation"></a><a id="_Toc448153786"></a>Higher education overview</h1>
                <p class="text"><em>Once you’ve earned your high school credential, what’s next? It’s time to revisit your long-term educational and career goals. Do you need a certain skill-set or type of training for your desired career field? Do you have to earn a specific degree to practice in your chosen profession? If so, “higher education” might be right for you. </em></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153787"></a>What is higher education?</h3>
                <p class="text">“Higher education” refers to additional schooling that you take beyond the high school-level, that leads to a professional certification or academic degree, such as a Career and Technical Education (CTE) certificate, associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or graduate or professional degree.

                <h4 class="sidebox">WHAT TYPE OF VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE? </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">CTE programs commonly cover fields such as: agriculture and natural resources, arts and media, building and construction, education and child/family services, energy and utilities, fashion and design, finance and business, health science and medical technology, hospitality and tourism, information technology, manufacturing and product development, marketing and sales, public services, or transportation services.<strong> </strong></p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153789"></a>What is Career and Technical Education? </h3>
                <p class="text">If you want a skills-based job in a particular career field, you may want to enroll in a CTE program where you focus on learning to do a specific type of work in that field. CTE programs are also called “certificate” or “vocational training” programs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2691" id="footnote-ref-2691">[2691]</a></sup> This chapter will help you think about whether a CTE program is a good choice for you; and, if so, what type of CTE program might be right for you. </p>
                <h4 class="textbox">Tutoring Help</h4>
                <p class="textbox">Most CTE programs lead to a <em>certificate</em>, but some lead to a <em>college degree</em>. This section focuses on CTE programs that lead to a <em>certificate</em>. If you’re interested in enrolling in a CTE program that leads to a <em>college degree</em>, you will find more helpful information in the following section on college degrees (PG. 965). </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153790"></a>How can a CTE program help me?</h3>
                <p class="text">In California, CTE programs are offered at community colleges, technical colleges, trade schools, vocational schools, at some 4-year colleges—and in many CDCR facilities and county jails. A CTE certification program can be a good path for you if the occupation you want <em>requires</em> a certificate, or if you want to gain practical skills and get into the workforce more quickly. Most CTE certificate programs are designed to get you certified, licensed, and hired in your chosen field directly and efficiently. A certificate can also be a stepping-stone toward a college degree, as some colleges accept certificate program credits and count them as progress toward a college degree.<sup><a href="#footnote-2692" id="footnote-ref-2692">[2692]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: A certificate is NOT a degree. It’s an award that shows you completed an educational or training program after high school. A certificate is also NOT an occupational license or certification, which you may need to do your job, depending on what your field is and where you live.</p>
                <p class="text">The cost of earning a certificate through a CTE program may not be worth it in certain fields where jobs are low-wage, unstable, and difficult to get. Also, if employers in your desired field don’t always require a certificate, you might consider going straight into the workforce.

Most programs have “open admissions,” meaning that if you meet the educational requirements, you will be admitted automatically, if space is available. For programs that are very popular, you may have to submit an application and be accepted to the program before you can enroll (admission is not automatic). To learn more about program requirements and enrollment policies, you can call the admissions office of the school you are interested in. This information is also usually available on the school’s website. Four-year colleges generally require you to submit an application for admission and be accepted to the school before you can enroll and register for classes. Applications often are available online (and can be submitted online), or you can call the school’s admissions office and ask them to send you an application by regular mail or email. There is usually a nonrefundable fee for applying, but you may be able to get the fee waived. </p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153797"></a>What are the different kinds of academic degrees? </h3>
                <p class="text">There are three main categories of college degrees: </p>
                <ol class="text">Associate degreesBachelor’s degreesGraduate Academic and Professional degrees. </ol>
                <p class="text">Different degrees are awarded in different subject and career areas, and they all have different requirements. For some degrees you have to earn another degree first, before you can pursue them. The various degrees are discussed in detail below</p>

                <h3><a id="_Toc448153799"></a>What is an associate degree? </h3>
                <p class="text">An associate degree (sometimes called a “two-year” degree) is an undergraduate college degree that is awarded by community and junior colleges (sometimes called “two-year colleges”), technical schools, and some four-year colleges and universities. Associate degree programs are designed to take two years of full-time study to complete (but part-time students may take longer), and generally require students to take various general education courses like English, math, and science. An associate degree can be a stepping-stone toward earning a bachelor’s degree or can prepare you to enter the workforce directly.<sup><a href="#footnote-2717" id="footnote-ref-2717">[2717]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153800"></a>What are some of the advantages of pursuing an Associate Degree?</h3>
                <p class="text">An Associate Degree is a great option for many people because:</p>
                <ol class="text">It can be earned in only 2 years;It costs less than a 4-year degree;It gets you into the workforce faster;The programs are more flexible, and can be scheduled around work or other obligations;It can be a low-cost stepping stone to a 4-year college or university, if you transfer credits (see PG. 974 for more information on transferring credits).</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153801"></a>What types of Associate Degrees are there?</h3>
                <p class="text">There are two categories of associate degrees: </p>
                <ol class="text">Associate of Arts (AA)/Associate of Science (AS)Associate of Applied Arts (AAA)/Associate of Applied Science (AAS). </ol>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">AA and AS degree programs</span> tend to be designed for students who eventually want to earn a bachelor’s degree at a four-year college or university. Therefore, these programs focus more on preparing students for higher levels of academic study. The courses offered and credits earned in an AA or AS program are meant to be easily transferred to a four-year college. (See PG. 974 for information on transferring credits.)<span class="emphasisitalic">The “Applied” degrees (AAA and AAS)</span>, on the other hand, are more geared toward preparing students for a particular career. Therefore, these programs emphasize more technical and vocational skills. AAAs and AASs are the college degree equivalent of CTE certificates.<sup><a href="#footnote-2718" id="footnote-ref-2718">[2718]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153802"></a>How can I decide if an Associate Degree is right for me, and which type I should get?</h3>
                <p class="text">An AA or AS degree may be a good choice if your main priority is not just to gain practical job skills, but also to sharpen your academic skills, explore diverse areas of study, and engage in critical analysis. They may also be a good choice if you intend to continue on to get your bachelor’s degree, but you want to save on costs. When you transfer your AA or AS credits to a four-year college, you can get up to half of the required credits for your bachelor’s degree at a fraction of the cost.<sup><a href="#footnote-2719" id="footnote-ref-2719">[2719]</a></sup>An AAA or AAS degree may be a good choice for you if you want to learn technical skills for a specific occupation, but you also want to have a college degree (not just a certificate). These degrees are also good for you if you want the technical, practical skills to work now, but you think that you might eventually want to get a higher college degree.<sup><a href="#footnote-2720" id="footnote-ref-2720">[2720]</a></sup> </p>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> In California, all public (state-funded) universities are required to guarantee a number of openings for students transferring from California Community Colleges (one transfer student for every two freshman admitted). This means that you have a good chance of getting into a California State University or a University of California school if you transfer in from a community college.<sup><a href="#footnote-2721" id="footnote-ref-2721">[2721]</a></sup></p>

                <ol class="text">In California, public community colleges are among the most economical choices for earning a college degree. Technically, there is no tuition, however, there are enrollment fees that are charged per credit-unit that you take.At the time of publication, the enrollment fee for California residents is $46 per credit-unit.<sup><a href="#footnote-2722" id="footnote-ref-2722">[2722]</a></sup>This per-unit enrollment fee is for California residents and is the same for all public community colleges across the state. Full-time enrollment is generally 12 credit-units per week (1 credit-unit = 1hour of class time), but you can take more or less if you like. (You may be eligible for a waiver of this fee, see PG. 986 for information on waiving community college enrollment fees.)Private community colleges and four-year colleges are the most expensive options (costs vary greatly, but may be several thousands of dollars). </ol>

They tend to have a larger student population and larger class sizes. <span class="emphasisitalic">Private schools</span> are generally more expensive, and tend to focus on keeping classes small and exposing students to many different subjects.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2729" id="footnote-ref-2729">[2729]</a></sup><strong>NOTE ABOUT IN-STATE TUITION:</strong> Most schools require that you have lived in California for a certain period of time in order to get the discounted “resident” or “in-state” tuition rate. <sup><a href="#footnote-2730" id="footnote-ref-2730">[2730]</a></sup> Some schools will consider time that you spent incarcerated in California towards this requirement. Check with your school’s admissions and financial aid offices to find out if your period of incarceration qualifies you as a California resident under that school’s policy. </p>

Almost everyone who applies to a four-year college or university must take one of these tests. Schools use applicants’ scores on these exams to make admissions decisions. The SAT covers math, reading, and writing, and focuses more on vocabulary and how well you can reason. It’s more popular with private schools, and with schools on the East and West coasts.<sup><a href="#footnote-2736" id="footnote-ref-2736">[2736]</a></sup> The ACT covers math, English, science, and reading, and focuses more on how much you know about the subjects being tested.

                <h2 class="subheading2"><a id="Educ_DistanceEduc"></a><a id="_Toc448153818"></a>Distance education</h2>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153819"></a>What is Distance Education?</h3>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Distance Education</span> (also called Distance Learning) is an education program that uses various technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the teacher. It is a way for students to take a formal course of study (high school, vocational, or college-level) without having to travel to the classroom. Although the students and the teachers are separated, the hallmark of Distance Education is regular and substantial interaction between them.<sup><a href="#footnote-2750" id="footnote-ref-2750">[2750]</a></sup> Distance Education courses usually incorporate multiple forms of media, including printed materials, CDs or DVDs, audio recordings, telephone communication, audio or video conferencing, email, and Web-casts and Internet streaming. There are two types of Distance Education interaction modes: “synchronous” and “asynchronous” instruction.<sup><a href="#footnote-2751" id="footnote-ref-2751">[2751]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153820"></a><span class="emphasisitalic"><strong>How do the two types of distance education work?</strong></span></h3>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Synchronous instruction</span> means that all of the students and the instructor(s) participate in the class at the same time, even though they are not in the same place. This is usually done through “live” teleconferencing, video conferencing web conferencing, or Internet chats. The class is given at a set time, and everyone calls or logs in at that time to participate. Synchronous courses can offer a level of interactivity similar to that of a traditional face-to-face class.<sup><a href="#footnote-2752" id="footnote-ref-2752">[2752]</a></sup> <span class="emphasisitalic">Asynchronous instruction</span> does not require that the student(s) and the instructor(s) participate at the same time. Students choose when they want to study the course materials or interact with the instructor(s). Asynchronous instruction is more flexible than synchronous instruction, but offers less interactivity because it is not “live.” In asynchronous instruction, course materials and communications are often delivered via CDs or DVDs, by traditional mail correspondence, or through e-mails, listservs and Internet downloads.<sup><a href="#footnote-2753" id="footnote-ref-2753">[2753]</a></sup></p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153821"></a>Are there benefits to distance education? </h3>

                <p class="textbox"><strong>BEWARE:</strong> Distance Education programs can vary in quality and legitimacy (quality of instruction can be low, credits/degrees may not be recognized by other schools or programs). Some programs are outright scams. (For information on how to tell if a program is a scam, see <em>Choosing Your Educational Path</em>, PG. 943).</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153822"></a>What credentials can I earn through distance education?</h3>
                <p class="text">Thanks to the Internet, you can earn pretty much any credential through a Distance Education program that you can earn through a traditional educational program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2755" id="footnote-ref-2755">[2755]</a></sup> This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor’s degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees. Distance Education programs are offered in most major CTE and college degree program areas. Program quality does vary greatly, however. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">WARNING: While many accredited, reputable schools offer credential programs through Distance education, there are also plenty of scam programs that will take your money and leave you with a useless piece of paper.

                <h4 class="textbox">ACCREDITATION OF DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMS</h4>
                <p class="textbox">There are numerous commercial websites that advertise hundreds of Distance Education programs and schools in the U.S. and abroad. However, keep in mind that schools and programs pay to be listed on these websites. This means that when you search these sites, only those that have paid will come up—you will not see the rest of the schools and programs out there, so the results of your search will be limited. Also, many of these websites claim that they only list “accredited” schools and programs, however, you should always do your own research to make sure that a school or Distance Education program is 1) legitimate and 2) recognized by an approved accrediting agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2756" id="footnote-ref-2756">[2756]</a></sup> (For more information on accreditation and scam programs, see <em>Choosing Your Educational Path</em>, PG. 943.)</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153824"></a>How much do distance education programs cost?</h3>
                <p class="text">The cost of Distance Education programs varies based on the type of program, the delivery media, and the institution that it is offered through. Programs offered through four-year colleges and more prestigious schools will be more expensive than those offered through local community colleges. </p>

Only accredited Distance Education institutions are allowed to participate in federal financial aid programs. Even if a school or program is eligible to participate, it must choose to do so. To find out if financial aid is available for a particular school or program, check with that institution’s financial aid office (For more information on financial aid, see <em>Paying For Your Education</em>, PG. 980).</p>
                <h2 class="subheading2"> <a id="Educ_CorrespondenceCourses"></a><a id="_Toc448153825"></a>Correspondence courses</h2>
                <p class="text">A correspondence course is a course offered by a school or program, where the student is separated from the teacher and course materials are provided through the mail or over the Internet. There is very little interaction between the student and the teacher, communication is usually initiated by the student (whenever the student wants), and students work at their own pace. Although there are some similarities, correspondence courses are not considered a type of distance education under federal law (see the table below for key differences).<sup><a href="#footnote-2757" id="footnote-ref-2757">[2757]</a></sup> </p>
                <h4>The Difference Between Distance Education and Correspondence Courses</h4>
                <p class="text">Although these two terms seem similar and are often confused, they refer to two different learning situations. Distance Education is generally an option that requires Internet access. Although Distance Education is one option to earn credit, due to the need of media/ Internet access, it may not be a possible option for an individual who is currently incarcerated.</p>

                <p class="text">Like with Distance Education programs, you can earn pretty much any credential that you can earn through traditional schooling through a correspondence course. This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor’s degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees. Program quality does vary greatly, however. While many accredited schools offer credential programs through correspondence courses, this is where you are most likely to see scam programs offering bogus higher education degrees. (For more information on spotting correspondence course scams, see <em>Choosing Your Educational Path</em>, PG. 943).</p>

                <h4 class="textbox">Student Responsibilities for Correspondence Courses</h4>
                <p class="textbox">If you enroll in a correspondence course while you are incarcerated, you will be responsible for getting all of the required textbooks and materials yourself. You may also be responsible for finding a “proctor” at your institution to administer any midterm or final exams. A proctor is someone who watches over you while you take your exam to make sure that you are the one actually taking the exam, and that you do not cheat. </p>

                <h4 class="textbox">Paying for Correspondence Course</h4>
                <p class="textbox">You may be eligible to receive financial aid to pay for your correspondence study, but it depends on the school you are taking courses through. Because of federal regulations, schools that offer primarily correspondence courses are not eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs. If more than 50% of the courses the institution offers are correspondence courses, or more than 50% of the students enrolled are taking correspondence courses, then the school is not eligible for federal financial aid. Additionally, a school is not eligible if more than 25% of its students are incarcerated.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2759" id="footnote-ref-2759">[2759]</a></sup> </sup>(For more information on financial aid, see Paying For Your Education, PG. 980.)</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153829"></a>Graduate academic and professional degree programs</h1>
                <p class="text">These degrees are offered at four-year colleges and universities and at graduate academic and professional schools. You must have a Bachelor’s degree before you can move on to pursue a graduate academic or professional degree. Students studying to earn one of these degrees must take highly advanced and specialized courses in a specific academic or professional field. It generally takes two years of full-time study for a <em>master’s degree, </em>and three to four years of full-time study for a <em>doctorate degree</em>.</p>
                <ol class="text">Graduate <span class="emphasisitalic">academic</span> degree programs require advanced study in an academic field. They emphasize theory, as opposed to practical application, with the goal of contributing to the body of knowledge on a subject. Master of Arts (M.A.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) are examples of graduate academic degrees. Graduate <span class="emphasisitalic">professional</span> degree programs require advanced study in a professional or vocational field. They emphasize the practical application of knowledge to a professional practice, and are usually required in order to get a license to work in that profession.<sup><a href="#footnote-2760" id="footnote-ref-2760">[2760]</a></sup> Master of Engineering (M.E.) and Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) are examples of graduate professional degrees. </ol>

                <p class="text">Your local public library should have various books and guides about graduate academic and professional schools and the programs they offer. These are also available from most book-sellers. You can also contact the alumni services center of the college where you got your undergraduate degree for information and help on searching for and applying to graduate academic and professional schools. </p>

                <p class="text">The federal government, state governments, organizations, businesses, and agencies offer financial aid of one or more types. Generally, financial aid providers fall into the following broad categories: <sup><a href="#footnote-2763" id="footnote-ref-2763">[2763]</a></sup> </p>

                <p class="text">Federal student aid is probably the most common type of financial aid that people rely on to help them pay for school. Most federal student aid is offered through the Department of Education.<sup><a href="#footnote-2764" id="footnote-ref-2764">[2764]</a></sup> (For detailed information on federal student aid, visit the Federal Student Aid website at: <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/">https://studentaid.ed.gov/</a>.) Federal student aid includes: <span class="emphasisitalic">Federal Grants</span>—Grants do not have to be repaid unless 1) you drop out of school, or 2) your GPA falls below a certain minimum (usually specified in the grant). </p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Federal Pell Grant</span>—This is the largest grant program available in the United States. Grants are awarded based on financial need.<span class="emphasisitalic">Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</span>—This grant is a supplement to the Pell Grant. It is reserved only for those students who already received a Pell Grant, but need more aid. The government gives a set amount of money to the schools that want to participate in the program, and the schools then give this grant to the students who have the most financial need. You must have been offered a Pell Grant to be eligible for this grant.<sup><a href="#footnote-2765" id="footnote-ref-2765">[2765]</a></sup></ol>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Federal Loans</span>—These are loans made to you by the federal government. They usually have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options than regular loans. The amount you are allowed to borrow depends on the cost of the school you want to go to, your financial need, and what other aid you get. Since these are loans, you will have to pay the money back!</p>
                <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Direct Loan</span>—The U.S. Dep’t of Educ. lends you the money directly.<span class="emphasisitalic">Federal Perkins Loan</span>—A school-based loan program where the school lends you money if you show exceptional financial need.<sup><a href="#footnote-2766" id="footnote-ref-2766">[2766]</a></sup> </ol>
                <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Federal Work-Study</span>—Work-study allows you to earn money through part-time employment (on or off campus) while you are in school. If you are awarded work-study aid, you are guaranteed to earn a certain amount of work-study funds as long as you have a work-study approved job (however, you cannot earn more than that amount).<sup><a href="#footnote-2767" id="footnote-ref-2767">[2767]</a></sup><span class="emphasisitalic">Other federal student aid programs</span> <span class="emphasisitalic">outside of the Department of Education include:</span></p>

                <p class="text">Maybe. It depends on the circumstances of your offense, the type of aid you are applying for, and your incarceration status.<sup><a href="#footnote-2769" id="footnote-ref-2769">[2769]</a></sup> The following is a summary of the possible implications of a criminal record on your federal student aid eligibility.</p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">Drug Convictions: </div>

                <p class="text">Unfortunately, while you are incarcerated, you are directly prohibited from getting certain kinds of federal aid (by law), and indirectly banned from some of the others (by logistics). However, once you are released, most of these restrictions are lifted and you become eligible to receive all forms of federal aid. You can even apply before your release so that your aid will be ready by the time you start school.<sup><a href="#footnote-2773" id="footnote-ref-2773">[2773]</a></sup></p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">Selective Service:</div>
                <p class="text">You are not eligible for federal or state financial aid if you did not register for the Selective Service, unless you fall into one of the exceptions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2774" id="footnote-ref-2774">[2774]</a></sup> See Pg. 80 to figure out whether you are (or were) required to register; how to register now (if you are between 18 and 25 years old and required to register); and how to request an excuse (in a “Status Information Letter”) for not having registered before (if you are 26 or older, never registered, and do not fall into one of the exceptions). </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you’re incarcerated, do not fill out the FAFSA unless you know you are going to be released in time to attend school <em>that same year</em>. FAFSA information is only good for one year. (Everyone who applies for federal student aid must complete a new FAFSA every year.) </p>
                <div class="headingboldunderl11">On Parole or Probation </div>
                <p class="text">You are free to apply for all forms of federal student aid, including those you couldn’t get while you were incarcerated. However, the drug and sex offense restrictions still apply (see above).<sup><a href="#footnote-2775" id="footnote-ref-2775">[2775]</a></sup></p>

Most of the educational programs available to you while you are incarcerated are either free or do not qualify for financial aid in the first place.

                <p class="text">Once you are released, you become fully eligible for federal student aid again. Your status on parole, probation, or under any other type of supervision does not affect your eligibility. However, any general restrictions based on your conviction history (drug/sex offenses) still apply.<sup><a href="#footnote-2786" id="footnote-ref-2786">[2786]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153844"></a><a id="ED_applyingforfedaid"></a>How do I apply for federal student aid?</h3>
                <p class="text">Everyone who applies for federal student financial aid must start by filling out the Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA). Not only does the FAFSA give you access to federal student aid (the largest source of financial aid), but most states and individual schools also use the FAFSA to determine what state or school-based financial aid you may be eligible for. </p>
                <ol class="text">If you have internet access, you can fill out the FAFSA online at: <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/">https://studentaid.ed.gov/</a>; If you want to fill out the paper version, you can get the form from most local public libraries or from the financial aid office of the school you want to attend. (There is a sample version of the 2015-2016 FAFSA provided in Appendix F, PG. 1004); You can also call the <span class="bold">Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC): </span>1 (800) 4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) to request a <span class="bold">copy </span></ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153845"></a>What information will I need to fill out the FAFSA?</h3>
                <p class="text">The FAFSA asks you for basic personal identifying information such as your name, date of birth, and address, as well as for information about your financial situation. Some of the information and documents you may need are:<sup><a href="#footnote-2787" id="footnote-ref-2787">[2787]</a></sup></p>
                <ol class="text">Your social security number;Your driver license number (if you have one);Your Alien Registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen (For a full list of eligible noncitizens, visit <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fotw15a.htm">https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fotw15a.htm</a>, or see Appendix G, PG. 1015);Federal tax information or tax returns including IRS W-2 information;Records of any untaxed income, such as child support received, interest income, and veterans non-education benefits that you received in the last year;Information on cash; savings and checking account balances; investments, including stocks and bonds and real estate (but not the home you live in); and business and farm assets.</ol>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153846"></a>When should I apply for federal financial aid?</h3>
                <p class="text">The FAFSA must be filled out at the beginning of the year <em>in which you intend to start school</em>. It becomes available on January 1, and although technically there is no deadline, try to fill it out as soon as possible after that date. Each state and every individual school has its own deadline by which it must receive FAFSA information in order to include federal funds in the financial aid package that it offers you. </p>
                <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you’re incarcerated, you should not fill out the FAFSA unless you know you are going to be released in time to attend school <em>that year</em>. FAFSA information is only good for one year. (Everyone who applies for federal student aid must complete a new FAFSA every year.) </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153847"></a>I already have student loans, can my student loans be deferred while I am incarcerated? </h3>
                <p class="text">Yes, you can have your loans deferred, but you must apply for a deferment. Deferment is a process that permits your to temporarily put your loan payments on hold for up to three years, depending on your loan provider and circumstances. If you have: Federal Perkins Loans then contact the school that made your loan or the school’s servicing agent. If you have: Direct Loans or Direct PLUS Loans then contact the Direct Loan Servicing Center at 1-800-848-0979 or online at <a href="http://www.dl.ed.gov">www.dl.ed.gov</a>.If you have FFEL Loans (includes FFEL PLUS Loans) then contact the lender or agency holding your loan. For the phone number of the agency in your state, contact FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID.<sup><a href="#footnote-2788" id="footnote-ref-2788">[2788]</a></sup>If you cannot get in touch with your student loan provider then we suggest asking someone on the outside to send you the necessary forms for deferment from your loan provider. Also, we suggest asking your case manager for proof of your incarceration so you can provide that to the loan providers along with the other paperwork. For more information on deferring your student loans while incarcerated, please write Root &amp; Rebound anytime or call us on our hotline every Friday from 9AM to 5PM PST. </p>

                <p class="text">The Cal Grant program is the largest source of student financial aid in California.

                <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE ABOUT CHANGE IN LAW FOR TANF/CALWORKS: </h4>
                <p class="sidebox">If you were qualified for TANF/Calworks but found ineligible because of a drug conviction, your criminal history would have previously disqualified you from the BOGFW program (see PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER, PG. 489, for details about TANF/CalWORKS eligibility). However, this law changed on April 1, 2015. After that date, your conviction history no longer makes you ineligible for TANF/CalWORKS benefits, so you may be able to qualify for BOGFW now.</p>
                <p class="text">The Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver (BOGFW) program waives enrollment fees for California Community Colleges for qualified low-income students. If you qualify for this waiver, you can go to community college for free (NOTE: you will still have to pay for other education expenses, such as course materials and supplies). If you are taking a correspondence course through a California Community College while you are incarcerated, you may qualify for a BOGFW—keep reading to learn more.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153853"></a>How do I know if I qualify for BOGFW?<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-2792" id="footnote-ref-2792">[2792]</a></sup></strong></h3>
                <p class="text">First, to qualify for the Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver, you must be a California resident. If you are a CA resident, you must also qualify based on one of several other criteria, for example, if you receive government benefits or fall into an eligible income bracket. (For a full list of BOGFW qualifications, see Appendix I, PG. 1017; for a 2015-16 BOGFW Application, see Appendix J, PG. 1020.)</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153854"></a>Will my criminal history disqualify me from state-based student aid?</h3>
                <p class="text">Maybe. If you are still incarcerated, you are disqualified from receiving any type of Cal Grant financial aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-2793" id="footnote-ref-2793">[2793]</a></sup> Additionally, certain drug convictions may make you ineligible for a Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver.</p>
                <h3> <a id="_Toc448153855"></a>How do I apply for state-based student aid?</h3>
                <p class="text">In order to apply for California-based financial aid, you will need to fill out either the FAFSA (see above) or the California Dream Act application, and submit your certified GPA to the Student Aid Commission. For detailed instructions on how to apply for state-based financial aid in California, visit the California Student Aid Commission website at: <a href="http://consumerfinance.gov/">http://consumerfinance.gov/</a>, or speak to a counselor in your school’s financial aid office. </p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153856"></a>School-Based Financial Aid</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153857"></a>What kinds of school-based aid might be available to me? </h3>
                <p>Many colleges and universities have their own financial aid programs and may offer scholarships, grants, loans, or work-study programs directly. Eligibility for school-based aid programs can be based on financial need, merit, or a variety of other qualifications. You should contact the financial aid offices of the schools you are interested in to find out what financial aid might be available from the individual schools. Some schools have more financial aid funding available and may be able to offer you a more substantial award. This may be an important factor in your decision about which school you want to attend.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153858"></a>Will my criminal history disqualify me from school-based aid?</h3>
                <p class="text">Again, policies for receiving school-based financial aid vary by school. Each school has its own requirements for the different types of aid it offers. Remember, even if your criminal history disqualifies you for some types of aid, you may still be eligible for others, so it is important to ask.</p>
                <h1 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153859"></a>Scholarships</h1>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153860"></a>What kinds of scholarships might be available to me? </h3>
                <p class="text">Many private organizations offer scholarships, usually to students meeting certain qualifications or having certain characteristics. Such scholarships may be need-based or merit-based (e.g., requiring high GPA or test scores). They may also be based on cultural, religious, ethnic, racial, national identity, political, religious, or other beliefs, or based on your chosen academic or career field.</p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153861"></a>How do I find and apply for scholarships?</h3>
                <p class="text">The best place to start is the financial aid office at the school you plan on attending. The financial aid counselors on staff can help you search for scholarships that you may qualify for.Other resources for information on scholarships include:</p>
                <ol class="text">Catalogs, such as Scholarships, Fellowships, and Loans and Peterson’s Scholarships and Loans for Adult Learners, which can be found at your public library. The following websites offer information on many types of scholarships: U.S. Dep’t of Educ.: <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov">https://studentaid.ed.gov</a>College Board: <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org">https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org</a>CollegeNet: <a href="http://www.collegenet.com">http://www.collegenet.com</a>CollegeToolkit.com: <a href="http://www.collegetoolkit.com">http://www.collegetoolkit.com</a>Fastweb: <a href="http://www.fastweb.com">http://www.fastweb.com</a>FinAid: <a href="http://www.finaid.org">http://www.finaid.org</a>Go College: <a href="http://www.gocollege.com">http://www.gocollege.com</a>Sallie Mae Scholarship Service: <a href="http://www.salliemae.com">http://www.salliemae.com</a>Scholarships.com: <a href="https://www.scholarships.com">https://www.scholarships.com</a></ol>
                <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE ON SCHOLARSHIPS:</strong> Be creative when you search for scholarships. They are awarded for all kinds of reasons and can be based on almost any criteria. Often funders do not even advertise that they offer them. You may even find scholarships specifically targeted at helping currently and formerly incarcerated people pursue higher education!<sup><a href="#footnote-2794" id="footnote-ref-2794">[2794]</a></sup> </p>
                <h3><a id="_Toc448153862"></a>Will my criminal history disqualify me from scholarships?</h3>
                <p class="text">Not necessarily. Most scholarship applications do not ask for criminal history information. So, as long as you qualify for the scholarship otherwise, your criminal record should not be a factor in whether or not you can get it. If a scholarship application does ask for your criminal history, there’s usually no harm in applying anyway, and it won’t affect any other scholarships you apply for. </p>
                <h2><a id="_Toc448153863"></a>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="text">Getting an education is probably the single-most important gift you can give yourself. It will open doors for you and help secure a future that is stable and rewarding—both financially and personally. In this chapter, we hope you learned practical steps that can help you along your educational path. We hope that we have inspired you to step onto that path with confidence and enthusiasm! </p>

                <p class="text">Many students have questioned the potential to be able to advance a career in specific fields/majors that require state licensure, registration with the state, or internships for units that necessitate clearance/background checks. We have found that each student should understand the "concern" when using ones criminal history against them. Depending on the type of credentials one is trying to pursue, each entity will look at the relevance of the crime in lieu of the career/licensure, (e.g. if you were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, applying for pharmacy school or becoming a pharmacy technician may not be the route to take), however we have come across state entities that have utilized one's juvenile record and were attempting to reject state licensure based on moral turpitude for having a criminal history in general. In order to combat this each student must be proactive in developing a healthy source of documentation on the contrary in order to detract from the legal distractions that do not have any relevance to the path contemplated and are used solely for the purposes of discouraging students from applying for a specific cause. We have successfully assisted students in receiving such state licensure but it indeed can be a battle, which can be overcome.</p>

The length of time you are ineligible depends on the type and number of convictions you have had for these offenses committed while you were receiving aid. The law differentiates between “possession of illegal drugs” and “sale of illegal drugs.” The table below lists the period of ineligibility by type of conviction, either possession or sale of a controlled substance and number of offenses:<sup><a href="#footnote-2796" id="footnote-ref-2796">[2796]</a></sup> </p>
