        <h3><a id="_Toc312427146"></a><a id="_Toc314389767"></a><a id="_Toc317247566"></a><a id="_Toc448153665"></a>Can my criminal record affect paternity issues and reconnecting with my child?</h3>
        <p class="text">Yes. After establishing paternity, a parent with a criminal record may be limited or completely denied some or all of the benefits of paternity at the time of the court hearing OR may have to establish a record of good behavior to do things like visit the child. This is a sad reality for many people in reentry trying to reconnect with their children. However, to even begin the process and establish a record of good behavior, it’s necessary to establish legal paternity/ parentage.</p>
