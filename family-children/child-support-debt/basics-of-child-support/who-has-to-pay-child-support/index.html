  <h1>Who has to pay child support?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc312427159"></a><a id="_Toc314389782"></a><a id="_Toc317247581"></a><a id="_Toc448153680"></a>Who has to pay child support?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">A court can only order you to pay child support if you are legally considered to be the child’s mother or father.<sup><a href="#footnote-2469" id="footnote-ref-2469">[2437]</a></sup> You have to pay child support when a family court judge makes a <em>child support order</em>, which says how much each parent is required to pay. A family court judge can make a child support order in any of the following cases (<em>please note:</em> <em>EITHER</em> parent can ask the judge for a child support order in any of the following cases):<sup><a href="#footnote-2470" id="footnote-ref-2470">[2438]</a></sup></p>
  
  <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Divorce, legal separation, or annulment—</span>for parents who are married to each other and want to end their relationship;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Paternity (parentage)—</span>for parents who are NOT married to each other;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Petition for Custody and Support of Minor Children—</span>for parents who have signed a voluntary Declaration of Paternity, OR who are married and want to stay married; </ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Domestic violence restraining order—</span>for married OR unmarried parents; OR</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">In some situations, the <span class="emphasisitalic">Local Child Support Agency (LCSA</span><em>)</em> may also start a child support case in court against one or both parents/caregivers (see next question for more information about LCSA child support cases).<sup><a href="#footnote-2471" id="footnote-ref-2471">[2439]</a></sup></ol>
  
  <p class="text">In general, you must continue to make child support payments until your child turns 18 years old,<sup><a href="#footnote-2472" id="footnote-ref-2472">[2440]</a></sup> or until the judge or LCSA agrees to change the order. Child support also ends if your parental rights are terminated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2473" id="footnote-ref-2473">[2441]</a></sup></p>
  
  <h5 class="question">Do legal guardians have to pay child support?</h5>
  
  <p class="text">No.<sup><a href="#footnote-2474" id="footnote-ref-2474">[2442]</a></sup> Child support is a parental responsibility, not a legal guardian’s responsibility, and therefore a judge cannot order a legal guardian to pay child support.<sup><a href="#footnote-2475" id="footnote-ref-2475">[2443]</a></sup> But <em>adoptive parents</em> DO take on a legal financial responsibility to support their adoptive child(ren)—because they assume <em>all legal rights and responsibilities of biological parents</em> (unlike legal guardians).<sup><a href="#footnote-2476" id="footnote-ref-2476">[2444]</a></sup></p>
