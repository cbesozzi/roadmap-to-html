  <h1>How are spousal support payments made?</h1>
  
  <h3><a id="_Toc312427179"></a><a id="_Toc314389805"></a><a id="_Toc317247607"></a><a id="_Toc448153706"></a>How are spousal support payments made?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Most spousal support is paid through “earning assignments,” also known as “wage garnishments.” This is a portion of money that is removed from your paycheck BEFORE you get paid. In the same way that many taxes are taken out, an “earning assignment” or wage garnishment is removed directly from your paycheck and is considered payment for your court spousal order (and/or child support order).<sup><a href="#footnote-2530" id="footnote-ref-2530">[2498]</a></sup> </p>
  
  <ol class="text">If you also have a child support earnings assignment in place, child support will be taken from your check first. Then, if you also owe spousal or partner support that will be taken from your check.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If the local child support agency (LCSA) is involved in your case, they will automatically issue the earnings assignment and begin collecting from your paycheck through your employer.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">If the LCSA is not involved in your case, your former spouse or domestic partner, or the court itself, will prepare an “earnings assignment” and send it to your employer.</ol>
