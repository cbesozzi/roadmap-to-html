    What types of supervision now fall under the control of county probation after realignment?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here is a quick overview of the different types of supervision that are now under the control of county probation departments in California after Realignment:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Informal Probation (also called summary or court probation): Informal probation is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by the court, not by a probation officer. A judge may order informal probation for misdemeanor convictions, but not for felony convictions at the time you’re sentenced; however, if you receive formal probation for a felony conviction, your supervision level may be later reduced to informal probation.[598] To learn more, go to PG. 210. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Formal Probation: Formal probation is a type of supervision in which you are supervised by a probation officer. It’s the minimum supervision that a judge can order for a felony conviction, and it can also be given out for some more serious misdemeanor convictions and people who have prior convictions.[599] To learn more, go to PG. 215.(Note: Depending on the type of felony, you may not be on probation, but rather on state parole, which is covered separately, beginning on PG. 162.) 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS): PRCS is a new type of supervision created by Realignment. Now, people who are released from state prison after serving a sentence for a non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual crime will be supervised by local county probation officers instead of state parole officers. PRCS can last up to 3 years, but will end after 1 year if you do not violate any of your PRCS conditions.[600] To learn more, go to PG. 218.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mandatory Supervision: Mandatory supervision is also a new type of supervision created by Realignment. If you were convicted of a “non-non-non” felony, judges in California state courts can now use a tool called “split sentencing,” which splits the time of your sentence between time in jail and a period of supervision by a county probation officer. This period of supervision after the jail term is called mandatory supervision.[601] To learn more, go to PG. 224.
