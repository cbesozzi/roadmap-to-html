          <h3><a id="_Toc448153151"></a>Under the “catch-all” ban, will my participation in a pre-trial intervention or diversion program matter?</h3>
          <p class="text">If the program shows up on your background check as a conviction, then the PHA or owner of the government-assisted housing can consider it, and possibly deny you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1177" id="footnote-ref-1177">[1147]</a></sup></sup></span><em> SO it depends on how it comes up on your background check.</em> </p>
          <ol class="text">If you are placed into a pre-trial intervention program and <em>you do NOT have to plead guilty in order to participate</em>, then a background check report will probably show the filing of a case, but no conviction while you are participating in the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1178" id="footnote-ref-1178">[1148]</a></sup> If you successfully complete the program, then your case will be dismissed without a conviction ever having been recorded. Therefore, it CANNOT show up as a conviction in a background check, because it never was one.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1179" id="footnote-ref-1179">[1149]</a></sup></sup> If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1180" id="footnote-ref-1180">[1150]</a></sup></sup></ol>
          <ol class="text">If instead you are placed in a pre-trial intervention program that <em>requires you to plead guilty</em>, then this guilty plea will probably appear as a conviction on a background check report while you are still participating in the program. If you successfully complete the program, your guilty plea should be automatically withdrawn and those records sealed, after which a private background check company CANNOT report this as a conviction.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1181" id="footnote-ref-1181">[1151]</a></sup></sup> If there are errors in your background check, the PHA or owner must give you an opportunity to correct them.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1182" id="footnote-ref-1182">[1152]</a></sup></sup></ol>
