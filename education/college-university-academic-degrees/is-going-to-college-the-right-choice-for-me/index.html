    Is going to college the right choice for me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    PROS:CONS:Can be a time to explore new and different areas of study.Can help you build social and professional networks with classmates and instructors. Can help you develop reading, writing, and analytical skills that are useful for many careers, and in daily life.Can prepare and qualify you for better jobs, increase your chances of getting hired, and boost your wages in the long run.[2758] Can prepare and qualify you for graduate or professional study, which may lead to even better jobs.Can be time consuming and may delay your entry into the workforce. College campus life can be distracting and overwhelming. Academic coursework may not give you the specialized technical skills and training you need for certain careers. A college degree is not necessary or even helpful in some career fields. Can be very expensive—if you take out loans to pay for school, you may end up with a lot of debt.

    What are the different kinds of academic degrees? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are three main categories of college degrees: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Associate degrees
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bachelor’s degrees
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Graduate Academic and Professional degrees. 
  </p>
  
  <p>

    Associate Degree Programs

    What is an associate degree? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An associate degree (sometimes called a “two-year” degree) is an undergraduate college degree that is awarded by community and junior colleges (sometimes called “two-year colleges”), technical schools, and some four-year colleges and universities. Associate degree programs are designed to take two years of full-time study to complete (but part-time students may take longer), and generally require students to take various general education courses like English, math, and science. An associate degree can be a stepping-stone toward earning a bachelor’s degree or can prepare you to enter the workforce directly.[2759]
