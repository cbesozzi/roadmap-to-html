<h1>General Conditions of State Parole: Little Protection Against Invasion of Privacy, Searches & Seizures</h1>

<p>
  General Conditions of State Parole: Little Protection Against Invasion of Privacy, Searches & Seizures
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, one of the conditions of parole is that you have almost no rights against searches and seizures by parole officers or other law enforcement, but you DO have some. Since this is a very important issue in daily life, this section explains in detail what privacy rights you DO hold against law enforcement searches.
</p>

<p>
  What are my rights to privacy of person, residence, or property while on parole?
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, you lose most of your constitutional rights against searches and seizures while you’re on parole. When you are OFF PAROLE, the government and law enforcement cannot unreasonably search you or your property or take things from you; and if they search you illegally, they can’t use what they find as evidence against you in court.[416] But when you are ON PAROLE, you have very few rights when it comes to searches of yourself, your property, or your residence. If you are on parole:
</p>

<p>
  You, your residence, and any of your property can be searched or seized (taken) by a probation officer, a CDCR agent or officer, or any other peace/police officer, at any time (day or night), with or without a warrant, with or without cause[417] — even if non-parolees live with you.[418]
</p>

<p>
  Officers can also search the passenger compartment of any car while you are a passenger, even if you are not the driver or owner of the car.[419]
</p>

<p>
  If you are placed in custody pending parole revocation proceedings, parole agents and other law enforcement officers may search your property.[420] 
</p>

<p>
  These conditions have been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court as applying to people on parole  even though the same conditions would violate the constitutional rights of someone who is not on parole or not in custody.[421] 
</p>

<p>
  If a law enforcement or parole officer knows you’re on parole, then the officer is allowed to assume that you’re subject to a “parole search condition” — meaning, that you can be searched without a warrant, without consent, and without reasonable suspicion or “probable cause” — since this is a general condition that applies to all people on parole.[422] 
</p>

<p>
  WHAT IS “PROBABLE CAUSE”?
</p>

<p>
  An officer has “probable cause” to search someone on parole, his/her residence, or his/her property when the officer has heightened knowledge that they are at the address where either the parolee or the subject of an arrest warrant resides.Motley v. Parks, 432 F.3d 1072, 1079 (9th Cir. 2005) overruled in part by United States v. King, 687 F.3d 1189 (9th Cir. 2012).
</p>

<p>
  HOWEVER: By law, if officers do not know that you’re on parole,[423] or if they do not have “probable cause” to believe that you live in the residence they want to search,[424] then they CANNOT search you, your residence, or your property in ways that go beyond normal rules that protect all citizens 
</p>

<p>
  Are there any other limitations on parole searches?
</p>

<p>
  Yes. When the officer knows or has probable cause to believe you are on parole, there is just one rule limiting his or her power to search you. The rule is that “searches must be no more intrusive than necessary for a legitimate interest in parole supervision.”[425]
</p>

<p>
  Courts have understood this to mean that parole searches must be “reasonable” — meaning they cannot take place too often, be at unreasonable times of day or night, be unreasonably long, or be conducted in an “arbitrary or capricious” (random or reckless) manner.[426] Searches cannot be motivated by the officer’s dislike of you, nor can they be used in ways that don’t serve legitimate law enforcement purposes (for example, they can’t be used to harass or embarrass you).[427]
</p>

<p>
  When conducting a parole search of your house, law enforcement officers must give you notice of their authority and purpose for the search before they enter your house.[428] 
</p>

<p>
  What if a parole or law enforcement officer conducts a search that I believe is unlawful? What action can I take?
</p>

<p>
  When law enforcement officers conduct an unlawful search, a person on parole has very few legal remedies. First off, it is very rare for a court to find that a parole search was “unreasonable.” Plus, even if a court finds that a parole search was “unreasonable” and therefore unlawful, evidence found through that search can still be used against you at a parole revocation hearing.[429] 
</p>

<p>
  If you believe that officers unlawfully searched you or your property, you should tell the attorney who is representing you. At a parole revocation hearing, you and your attorney should be notified of evidence used against you (see PG. 200 for information on parole revocation hearings). 
</p>

<p>
  IN SUM, WHILE YOU ARE ON PAROLE, OFFICERS CAN SEARCH YOU OR YOUR PROPERTY:
</p>

<p>
  WITHOUT your consent (your permission);WITHOUT a search warrant;WITHOUT “probable cause” or even reasonable suspicion that you violated parole.[430] 
</p>

<p>
  BUT…In order to search you or your property, an officer must know or have a reason to know that you are on parole or some other type of supervision. Courts have said that a search may be illegal if the parole officer didn’t know, or didn’t have reason to know, that the person being searched was on parole. However, any items that are taken (seized) during the search may still be used as evidence against you in a later court proceeding or in a revocation hearing. Still, the search/seizure cannot be more intrusive than reasonably necessary.If you believe you were subject to an illegal search — or if you believe that an officer who searched you without probable cause, consent, or a search warrant didn’t know you were on parole — tell your attorney, contact a public defender’s office, or call Root & Rebound’s Reentry Legal Hotline at 510-279-4662 (Fridays, 9 am – 5 pm PST)..
