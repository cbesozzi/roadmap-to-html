  <h2><a href="/the-building-blocks-of-reentry/pre-release-planning-getting-a-california-state-id/who-is-eligible-for-the-cal-id-program/index.html">Who is eligible for the CAL-ID program?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Who is eligible for the CAL-ID program?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under the expanded CAL-ID program, you are eligible for a California state ID if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a set release date, AND that date is 120-210 days (approximately 4-7 months) away;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You previously had a California state ID or California driver license;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your previous California state ID or driver license was issued in the past 10 years; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You don’t owe any DMV fees for your previous California state ID or driver license; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a photo on file with the DMV that is no more than 10 years old; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You don’t have any active felony holds, warrants, or detainers that could cause you to go back to prison or jail after your release;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You don’t have an active Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold that would cause you to be deported after your release;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can provide an address where you will live after your release (note: this is the address that will be printed on the California state ID card, not your prison address); AND
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You provide the following information, and the DMV can make sure it’s true:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    True full name;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Date of birth; 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Valid Social Security Number (SSN); 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Legal presence (legal immigration status) in the United States 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Note: In case you don’t know some of this information, CDCR should have it on file.[67]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    REMEMBER: Even if you are not eligible for the CAL-ID program, you can still apply for a California state ID through the normal process after you are released. Below, learn how to apply for a California state ID once you’re out.
