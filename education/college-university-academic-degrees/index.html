<h1>College & university academic degrees</h1>

<h2 class="subheading"><a id="Educ_CollegeUnivAcademicDegrees"></a><a id="_Toc448153795"></a>College &amp; university academic degrees</h2>

<p class="text">If you have the desire, time, and financial resources to explore a wider range of academic subjects and skills, you may want to pursue a college degree. In college you can study a diverse range of topics, instead of focusing only on the skills you need for one type of job; and you can develop a broad foundation of writing and critical thinking skills to sharpen your mind and prepare you for a wide variety of careers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2787" id="footnote-ref-2787">[2754]</a></sup> A college degree also may help you qualify for more secure, higher-status, and better-paying jobs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2788" id="footnote-ref-2788">[2755]</a></sup> </p>

<div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re currently incarcerated</div>

<p class="text">You likely do not have access to in-person college programs, but you may be able to pursue a college degree through Distance Education. (See PG. 1076 for information on Distance Education programs.) </p>

<div class="headingboldunderl11">If you’re formerly incarcerated</div>

<p class="text">You can pursue a college degree at a community or junior college, a technical school, or 4-year college or university. While college can be expensive,<sup><a href="#footnote-2789" id="footnote-ref-2789">[2756]</a></sup> there are ways to reduce and supplement the expense (see Paying for College, PG.<strong> </strong>1082).<sup><a href="#footnote-2790" id="footnote-ref-2790">[2757]</a></sup> </p>
