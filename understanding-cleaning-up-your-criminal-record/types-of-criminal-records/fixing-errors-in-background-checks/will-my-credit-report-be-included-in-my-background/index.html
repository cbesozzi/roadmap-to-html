          <h3><a id="_Toc448153892"></a>Will my credit report be included in my background check?</h3>
          <p class="text">Generally, no. Background check companies are NOT allowed to include your credit report in your regular background check, because not everyone who is allowed to see your background check is also allowed to see your credit report. When companies run your credit report, they must follow a separate set of rules that are specific to credit reports, which are not covered in this guide. The only time that your credit report and background check will be together is when someone who is <em>ALLOWED to see both</em> requests them together (for example, a landlord can request both at the same time, but most employers cannot see your <em>credit</em> report, just your criminal background check).<sup><a href="#footnote-2916" id="footnote-ref-2916">[2882]</a></sup> </p>
          <h3>HOW DO I GET A COPY OF MY CREDIT REPORT WHILE I’M INCARCERATED?</h3>
          <p class="text">You must mail in a request for your free credit report to the following address:</p>
          <p class="text">Annual Credit Report Request Service<br/>PO Box 105281<br/>Atlanta, GA 30348</p>
          <p class="text"><br/>Include your full name, date of birth, Social Security Number and any addresses used in the last two years in a letter stating that you are requesting a free credit report. To find out how to obtain your Social Security Number, see [PG. XX]</p>
          <p class="text"><em>NOTE: </em>When this guide refers to background checks or background check reports, it means information about your <em>criminal history</em> (and certain other personal information)—but NOT your credit report.
