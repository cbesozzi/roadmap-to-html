  <p>
    What special conditions could apply to me on federal parole?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the U.S. Parole Commission determines that it is necessary to protect the public from further crimes and to provide adequate supervision over you, it may impose a special condition other than one of the general conditions above. Examples of special conditions of release that the Commission might require of you are found at 28 C.F.R. § 2.204(b)(2), and include the following possible requirements:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the Parole Commission requires you to participate in a drug-treatment program, you must submit to a drug test before release and to at least two other drug tests, as determined by your Probation Officer. However, a decision not to impose this special condition, because available information indicates that you have a low risk of future substance abuse, constitutes good cause (a good reason under the law) for suspending the drug testing requirements of 18 U.S.C. 4209(a).[933] Furthermore, a grant of parole or re-parole depends on your passing all pre-release drug tests administered by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).[934]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must live in or participate in a program at a community corrections center, or both, for all or part of your period of supervision;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must participate in a drug-or alcohol-treatment program, and abstain from all use of alcohol and other intoxicants;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As an alternative to incarceration, you may be put on house arrest (home confinement), meaning you remain at home during nonworking hours, and your compliance is monitored by telephone or electronic signaling devices;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must allow a supervising off it a time of their choosing, to conduct a search of your person, or of any building, vehicle, or other area under your control, and to seize contraband found.
