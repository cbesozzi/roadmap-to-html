  <p class="text">If you and your spouse or partner either get a court-order for spousal support or you agree to a payment plan on your own, the spouse or partner that is the higher wage earner will have to pay the lesser-earning spouse or partner an adequate amount of money to help pay for the less his/her basic living expenses.<sup><a href="#footnote-2529" id="footnote-ref-2529">[2497]</a></sup></p>

  <p class="text">Owing spousal support can affect your credit score, your ability to get some types of employment, your income, and more. For example:</p>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Your Credit Score Can Be Affected:</em> If a Local Child Support Agency (LCSA) is involved they will report your support non-payment to credit rating agencies. They are also entitled to use all the enforcement mechanisms that they use for child support non-payments.</ol>
  
  <ol class="text"><em>Your Employment and Income Can Be Affected:</em> If the person receiving spousal supports files for wage garnishment, your employer may be forced to withhold part of your wages to pay back your past due spousal support.</ol>
