        <h1>I can’t read, and/or I physically can’t vote by myself. Can I get help in the voting booth?</h1>
        <h3><a id="_Toc328831324"></a>I can’t read, and/or I physically can’t vote by myself. Can I get help in the voting booth?</h3>
        <p class="text">Yes. If you can’t mark a ballot because you can’t read, and/or because you have a disability, tell a poll worker when you get to your voting location (“polling place”).</p>
        <ol class="text">You have the right to use a voting machine that is accessible to you. Poll workers should explain how to use the voting equipment before you go into the booth, and should also provide further help if you need it after you go into the booth. They are legally required to do so.<sup><a href="#footnote-282" id="footnote-ref-282">[282]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You also have the right to select up to 2 people (including a poll worker) to help you in the booth, as long as these people aren’t your employer, agents of your employer, or officers/agents of your labor union.<sup><a href="#footnote-283" id="footnote-ref-283">[283]</a></sup> </ol>
        <h3><a id="_Toc328831325"></a>What could happen if I voted in an election that I was not legally allowed to vote in? </h3>
        <p class="text">It depends. If you ACCIDENTALLY voted in an election when you had no legal right to do so, you will probably not be in trouble with the law. But if you PURPOSEFULLY voted in an election when you had no legal right to do so, and you knew you were breaking the law by voting, you could be found guilty of voter fraud. <sup><a href="#footnote-284" id="footnote-ref-284">[284]</a></sup> (Voter fraud requires “specific intent,” as explained on PG. 75)<sup><a href="#footnote-285" id="footnote-ref-285">[285]</a></sup>.</p>
        <h2><a id="_Toc328831326"></a><a id="VIII_SELECTIVE_SERVICE"></a>SELECTIVE SERVICE REGISTRATION</h2>
        <h3><a id="_Toc328831327"></a>What is the Selective Service system, AND why is it important? </h3>
        <p class="text">The Selective Service System is a federal agency that keeps a list of all adult males in the United States.<sup><a href="#footnote-286" id="footnote-ref-286">[286]</a></sup> In case of a military emergency, the federal government uses the Selective Service registration list to draft men for military service<sup><a href="#footnote-287" id="footnote-ref-287">[287]</a></sup> — and to provide public service work assignments for men who are morally opposed to military service.<sup><a href="#footnote-288" id="footnote-ref-288">[288]</a></sup> If you’re a male between ages 18 and 25 and you live in the United States, and you don’t fall under one of the legal exceptions, you <em>must </em>register with the Selective Service <em>before you turn 26</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-289" id="footnote-ref-289">[289]</a></sup> To learn about the legal exceptions to registration, see the list below under the question: “WHO IS <em>NOT</em> REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH SELECTIVE SERVICE?”<sup><a href="#footnote-290" id="footnote-ref-290">[290]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">You need to know about the Selective Service because almost <em>ALL</em> males who are between ages 18 and 25, and who live in the United States, are legally required to register with Selective Service, with only a few exceptions. <em>IT’S THE LAW, </em>and if you do not follow it, there could be negative consequences. If you did not apply when you legally should have, you might now be disqualified from certain federal or state programs and benefits — such as student financial aid, citizenship, federal job training, or federal jobs. Read on for more information. </p>
