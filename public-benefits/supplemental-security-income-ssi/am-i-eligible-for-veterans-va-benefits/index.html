  <h2><a href="/public-benefits/supplemental-security-income-ssi/am-i-eligible-for-veterans-va-benefits/index.html">Am I eligible for veterans’ (VA) benefits?</a></h2>

  
  <p>
    Am I eligible for veterans’ (VA) benefits?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Generally, to be eligible for most VA benefits:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must have been discharged from active military service,[1662] and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must have served the minimum time in service;[1663] and 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your character of discharge must not be dishonorable or based on bad conduct;[1664] and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must not be statutorily barred from all VA benefits because of your reason for discharge
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must not currently be wanted for an open felony warrant.[1665] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    DISHONORABLE CONDITIONS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Under VA regulations, your discharge was issued “under dishonorable conditions” if you were released under any of the following circumstances: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “acceptance of an undesirable discharge to escape trial by general court-martial”“mutiny or spying”“an offense involving moral turpitude (generally including conviction of a felony)”;“willful and persistent misconduct”; or“homosexual acts involving aggravated circumstances or factors affecting the performance of duty.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your basic eligibility for different benefits will also depend on the type of military service you performed, how long you served, and other specific needs or issues you may have.[1666] For more details about benefits you may qualify for, visit a VA regional office, call 1-800-825-1000, visit www.va.gov/benefits, or create an account at www.ebenefits.va.gov.[1667] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ABOUT DISHONORABLE DISCHARGES
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Certain dishonorable discharges may bar you from all VA benefits (see PG. 621).[1668] But for some dishonorable discharges, including most situations involving a felony conviction, you might still qualify for benefits if the VA reviews your case and decides your discharge wasn’t under dishonorable conditions (see PG. 622) through a “discharge uPGrade.”[1669] More specifically, if you have a discharge status of honorable or general under honorable conditions, you are automatically eligible to apply for most VA Benefits including VA health care, VA Compensation, and VA Pension.[1670] If you have a discharge status of dishonorable or bad conduct (by general court martial) you are likely barred from all VA benefits.[1671] If you have a discharge status of other than honorable (OTH), bad conduct (special court martial), or uncharacterized, the VA is required to make an individual determination as to whether you were discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable (see PG. 621).[1672] This determination is based solely on your period of service in the military, not conduct or convictions post-service.[1673]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Can my criminal history limit my ability to get VA benefits? 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    VA BENEFITS & FELONY CONVICTIONS
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition, for certain VA benefits, your benefit amounts will be restricted or discontinued if you’ve been incarcerated for 60 or more days for a felony conviction.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes. You’re not eligible for VA compensation, pension, or death benefits if:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You’re currently wanted for an open warrant on a felony charge;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You’re violating a probation or parole condition for a felony sentence;[1674] or
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have a felony conviction that led to your discharge[1675]—unless and until the VA reviews your case and determines that the circumstances leading to your discharge may have been “other than dishonorable.”[1676]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    IMPORTANT: INFORMATION ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE & DISCHARGE CONDITIONS: If you served more than one term of active military service, and your discharge for one of the terms was under dishonorable conditions, you may not be eligible for VA benefits based on that term—however, if your discharge for a different term of service ended under honorable conditions, you can still be eligible for VA benefits based on this separate term.[1677]Also, if you completed a full term of enlistment, and it didn’t end with a formal discharge because you later reenlisted, you can still be eligible for VA benefits based on completion of that first term.[1678]If you have disabilities that are service-connected, and your discharge was under dishonorable conditions, you may not be eligible for VA disability compensation due to your discharge status. However, as long as your discharge isn’t related to a situation that would absolutely disqualify you from VA benefits by law (see PG. 621) you may still be eligible for VA health care benefits (e.g., treatment at a VA medical facility) for those disabilities.[1679].
