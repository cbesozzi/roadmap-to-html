          <h3><a id="_Toc448153252"></a>I live in transitional housing, and the housing provider (or parole) IS trying to evict me with very little notice &amp; without going to court. Is this legal &amp; what are my options?</h3>
          <p class="text">In most cases, a transitional housing provider MUST follow all of the normal rules and laws to evict you. That means they must follow all of the rules for giving you proper notice and taking you to court if they want to evict you.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1294" id="footnote-ref-1294">[1264]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
          <p class="text">** There is one <em>VERY SMALL EXCEPTION</em> that could allow a transitional housing provider to evict you more quickly than the standard court process. However, for this exception to apply, it must be <em>explicitly</em> written in the contract you signed with the transitional housing provider. There are other requirements beyond that, but at a minimum, if it‚Äôs not in your contract with the transitional housing provider, then the transitional housing provider can‚Äôt evict you overnight, with little notice, or without first going to court.</p>
          <p class="text">If this issue is a condition of your supervision (a requirement of parole or probation), see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG.¬†145, to learn more about rules (called ‚Äúconditions‚Äù) of different types of supervision in California, and how to challenge them.</p>
          <h2><a id="_Toc448153253"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p class="text">Where you live is critical to your well-being. Unfortunately, it can also be one of the most challenging aspects of reentry. Hopefully, this Chapter has helped you understand your housing options, and given you the tools to help you to find appropriate housing and recognize illegal discrimination when it occurs.</p>
