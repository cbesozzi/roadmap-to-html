  <p>
    Can the Department of STate Hospitals (DSH) hold me beyond my Maximum Discharge Date (MDD)?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Possibly. If you are classified as a MDO and you reach your maximum discharge date (your maximum parole term under state law, after which you must be discharged; see PG. 170), the DSH can seek to continue your mental health commitment. This means you would have to stay in inpatient treatment for one more year.[501] 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your MDO commitment is continued,the DSH can continue to seek re-commitment every year.[502] If the DSH seeks to continue your MDO commitment, you’ll be appointed an attorney and a jury trial in the county Superior Court. The district attorney will represent the DSH. At trial, the DSH must prove that you still meet MDO criteria — that you are (1) diagnosed with a serious mental illness that causes you to pose a substantial danger of physical harm to others, AND (2) were sentenced to prison for an offense involving violence.[503]
