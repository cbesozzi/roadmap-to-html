          <p class="text">It depends, but probably not entirely.</p>
          <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The process for changing or lowering your PAST, OVERDUE child support debt (“arrears”) is <em>different</em> than the process for changing your CURRENT child support payment amount. This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue</em> child support debt. To learn about changing your <em>current</em> child support payments, see PG. 964.</p>
          <p class="text">This question will explain how to change your <em>past, overdue </em>child support debt.</p>
          <h4 class="step">First, figure out whether you owe overdue child support payments to the other parent (or caregiver) or to the state.</h4>
          <p class="text">To find out, you can contact the LCSA and ask for a breakdown (detailed list) of your arrears. This will show how much you owe to the other parent and/or to the state. The chart below can also help you figure out whom you owe child support to—but it’s always best to get a breakdown from the LCSA to be sure!</p>
          <h4 class="step">Once you know whom you owe money to, use the following chart to figure out your next steps:</h4>

You may be able to work out an agreement to forgive some or all of the overdue child support, in exchange for your paying off the remaining amount right away. <em>For example</em>, you could offer to make—and the other parent (or caregiver) could agree to accept—a single lump sum payment all at once, rather than making many smaller payments over time and having the debt drag out.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="textbox">Important Information to Know:</p></td><td><p class="textbox">If you miss <em>any</em> of your current child support or COAP payments, your COAP agreement will be cancelled AND you will owe all the debt that was previously reduced. You may not receive a refund for any of the COAP payments that you’ve already made, and you will be unable to reapply to the COAP program for 2 years.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2518" id="footnote-ref-2518">[2486]</a></sup></sup></p></td><td><p class="textbox">If you reach an agreement with the other parent, you should make sure to put it in writing for the LCSA and the judge.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2519" id="footnote-ref-2519">[2487]</a></sup></sup></p></td></tr></table>
