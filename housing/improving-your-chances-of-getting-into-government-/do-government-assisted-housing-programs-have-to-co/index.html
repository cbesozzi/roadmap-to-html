  <h3><a id="_Toc448153158"></a>Do government-assisted housing programs have to consider mitigating circumstances &amp; evidence of rehabilitation?</h3>
  
  <p class="text">Generally, programs are not required to consider mitigating circumstances and evidence of rehabilitation,<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1194" id="footnote-ref-1194">[1164]</a></sup></sup> but they are encouraged to do so.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1195" id="footnote-ref-1195">[1165]</a></sup></sup></span> Only the Public Housing program—run by your local Public Housing Authority (PHA)—MUST consider mitigating circumstances (that is in cases where the PHA has a criminal record ban in place that is not required by law—see PG. 401 for more information on such bans that are <em>allowed</em>, but not required).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1196" id="footnote-ref-1196">[1166]</a></sup></sup> </p>
  
  <p class="text">Good news! THIS GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND PRESENT FACTS IN A WAY THAT WILL PUT YOUR RECORD IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT—WHICH WILL IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING ACCEPTED.</p>
  
  <p class="text">All PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing are ENCOURAGED to look at the following (and for the Public Housing program, PHAs <em>must</em> look at the following):<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1197" id="footnote-ref-1197">[1167]</a></sup></sup></p>
  
  <ol class="text">Every application for housing on a case-by-case basis;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The seriousness of the offense;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The time that has passed since the offense;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The effect that denial of admission would have on the rest of your family;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The effect that denial of admission would have on the community;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">The extent to which you have taken responsibility for your actions and taken steps to prevent or mitigate bad conduct in the future;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Evidence of rehabilitation;</ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Mitigating circumstances relating to your disability or the disability of any family member; <em>and</em></ol>
  
  <ol class="text">Evidence of your family’s participation or willingness to participate in social services, reentry support, or counseling programs.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1198" id="footnote-ref-1198">[1168]</a></sup></sup></ol>
