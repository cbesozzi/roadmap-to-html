  <p>
    What are some positive factors that could help my request to move/ transfer be approved?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. The following are factors that will likely work in your favor if you can show these to your Probation Officer:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Reliable job offer in new area;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Proven family and community ties;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Other positive connections to the new area;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Reasonable plan for living in the new area (e.g., income, social and family support, etc.);
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The new address was your legal residence prior to incarceration, and had nothing to do with your criminal offense;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You have nowhere else to go and would be homeless if you don’t move; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The move appears to be in your best interest for other reasons not listed above.
