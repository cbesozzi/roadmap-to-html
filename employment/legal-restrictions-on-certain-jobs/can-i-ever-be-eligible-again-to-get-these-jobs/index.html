  <p>
    Can I ever be eligible again to get these jobs?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It depends. Each of these jobs has very specific rules about what convictions will disqualify you, and whether and how you can become eligible for them again. It will depend on the specific laws, regulations, and other rules that apply to that type of work.[1907] It is recommended that you ask a lawyer to review your RAP sheet and explain how your convictions will affect your ability to get the job you want. See PG. 745 for how to contact an attorney. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For some jobs, you are only disqualified for a certain period of time, and then you will become eligible after that time has passed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For many jobs, you can become eligible if your conviction is expunged, or if you get a Certificate of Rehabilitation or a pardon for the conviction.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For some jobs, you can request a waiver or exemption for your conviction, which means asking the government to make an exception to the law based on your individual circumstances. You may need to present evidence of rehabilitation and other factors showing that your conviction does not pose a risk of harm and therefore you should not be disqualified because of it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you think you were disqualified based on incorrect information in your record, you may be able to appeal the disqualification and show that you should NOT be disqualified according to the law. For example, if you were not actually convicted of the offense that caused you to be disqualified for the job (e.g., the charges were dismissed, or you pleaded guilty to a lesser offense that does NOT disqualify you), you can appeal and present court records showing that you were not convicted of that offense.
