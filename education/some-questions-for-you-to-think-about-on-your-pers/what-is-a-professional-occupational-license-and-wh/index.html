  <p>
    What is a professional/occupational license and what does it require?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In California, people who work in certain jobs are required to get a license from the state to do so. There are over 200 professions in California that require a professional/occupational license—ranging from barbers and cosmetologists, to security guards, to nurses and nursing assistants, to teachers, doctors, and lawyers. These professional/occupational licenses are issued and regulated by over 40 different licensing boards under the control of the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA).[2609]
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Applying for a professional/occupational license generally requires submitting your fingerprints, paying various application fees, and proving that you meet certain educational and/or work experience requirements, which are set by the particular licensing board that you’re applying to.[2610]
